theorem neg_one_mul_eq_neg {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a : R) : (-1 : R) * a = -a := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library; no mathematical content to audit.
- `theorem neg_one_mul_eq_neg {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a : R) : (-1 : R) * a = -a := by sorry`
  - Variables: `R` is a type with a ring structure `[Ring R]` (i.e., it has addition, multiplication, 1, and additive inverses). `a : R` is an arbitrary element.
  - Statement: `(-1 : R) * a = -a`. That is, multiplying `a` by `-1` on the left equals the additive inverse of `a`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Let R be a ring and let a ∈ R. Show that (-1)a = -a.""
- The Lean theorem exactly matches this: assumes `R` is a ring, `a ∈ R`, and asserts `(-1) * a = -a`. The notation `(-1)a` in prose is standard shorthand for `(-1) * a`. No extraneous assumptions are added; no proof is provided (which is fine for translation auditing). The code uses standard Mathlib typeclasses (`[Ring R]`).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. No differences in generality or meaning. Left-multiplication by `-1` is the conventional reading of `(-1)a` and is appropriate for arbitrary (not necessarily commutative) rings.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem neg_mul_neg_example {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a b : R) : (-a) * (-b) = a * b := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: For any type `R` with a ring structure (`[Ring R]`) and any elements `a b : R`, the equality `(-a) * (-b) = a * b` holds. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but we are only auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
Natural language: ""Let R be a ring and let a,b in R. Show that (-a)(-b) = ab."" The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes `R` is a ring, takes `a` and `b` in `R`, and asserts `(-a) * (-b) = a * b`.

3) Final check and potential differences:
- The Lean code uses `[Ring R]`, which in Mathlib denotes a (unital, not necessarily commutative) ring. The natural language says ""ring"" without specifying unital, but in contemporary usage (and in Mathlib), ring typically means unital, so this is standard. Even if one allowed non-unital rings, the statement remains true; the slightly stronger assumption does not alter the meaning for this fact.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. No placeholders other than the proof omission, which is acceptable for this translation audit.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Context: R is a type with a Ring structure; a, b, c are elements of R.
- mul_zero: a * 0 = 0. This asserts left-multiplication by 0 yields 0.
- zero_mul: 0 * a = 0. This asserts right-multiplication by 0 yields 0.
- mul_neg: a * (-b) = -(a * b). This says multiplying by the negative on the right negates the product.
- neg_mul: (-a) * b = -(a * b). This says multiplying by the negative on the left negates the product.
- neg_mul_neg: (-a) * (-b) = a * b. This says the product of two negatives equals the product of the positives.
- distrib_sub: a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c. This is left distributivity over subtraction.
- neg_one_mul: (-1 : R) * a = -a. Multiplying by −1 yields the additive inverse.
There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; only theorem statements with placeholder proofs (which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The NL statement asks to prove: a·0 = 0 = 0·a, a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b, (−a)(−b) = ab, a(b−c) = ab−ac, and (−1)a = −a. The Lean code provides exactly these as separate theorem statements:
- a*0 = 0 and 0*a = 0 are given separately (equivalent to the chained equality).
- a*(−b) = −(a*b) and (−a)*b = −(a*b) capture the chained equality a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b.
- (−a)*(−b) = a*b matches (−a)(−b) = ab.
- a*(b−c) = a*b − a*c matches a(b−c) = ab − ac.
- (−1)*a = −a matches (−1)a = −a.
The typeclass assumption [Ring R] matches the ring context required. All statements are standard ring equalities.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No missing cases; splitting chained equalities into separate theorems is logically equivalent.
- No extra or altered conditions; uses Ring as in the NL statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only theorem statements with sorry, which does not affect the translation of statements.
Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language claims.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, the standard mathematics library for Lean.
- `variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]`: Fix a type R equipped with a ring structure. This means R is a ring (in Mathlib's sense: noncommutative ring with 1 and an additive commutative group).
- `theorem mul_sub_left (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry`: States the proposition that for any elements a, b, c in the ring R, we have a*(b - c) = a*b - a*c. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: Let R be a ring and a, b, c ∈ R. Show that a(b - c) = ab - ac. The Lean statement exactly matches this: R is a ring, a, b, c are elements of R, and the equality a*(b - c) = a*b - a*c is asserted.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Assumptions: Lean uses `[Ring R]`, which includes a multiplicative identity 1. The natural statement typically means a ring (often with 1 in many conventions). Even if one allowed rings without 1, assuming a slightly stronger structure does not change the meaning of the distributive identity being asserted; the statement remains faithful.
- No extra constraints (like commutativity) are added.
Therefore, the translation is faithful to the original statement.

  This states: For any type R with a ring structure, and any elements a, b in R, we have the two equalities: a * (-b) = -(a * b) and -(a * b) = (-a) * b. The use of `∧` encodes the chain equality a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Let R be a ring and a, b ∈ R. Show that a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b. The Lean statement asserts exactly these two equalities in a ring, which is logically equivalent to the chain equality. No extra or missing assumptions are made.

They are the same. The Lean theorem precisely captures both equalities required by the chain equality in a ring. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Int`: set up the environment and open integer-related namespace.
- Comment block restates the problem: given n a positive integer and a, b, c, d ∈ ℤ with a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), show ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_673 (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) {a b c d : Int} (h1 : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) (h2 : c ≡ d [ZMOD n]) : a * c ≡ b * d [ZMOD n] := by sorry`
  This declares: Let n be an integer with 0 < n, and a, b, c, d be integers. If a ≡ b modulo n and c ≡ d modulo n, then a*c ≡ b*d modulo n. The `[ZMOD n]` notation is Lean's standard for Int.ModEq n.

Step 2: Assess if the theorem statement matches the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let n be a fixed positive integer; a, b, c, d ∈ ℤ; suppose a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n); show ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- Lean theorem: n : Int with 0 < n (so positive), a, b, c, d : Int, hypotheses a ≡ b [ZMOD n] and c ≡ d [ZMOD n], conclusion a*c ≡ b*d [ZMOD n].
- This is a faithful translation. Using Int for n with positivity aligns with “positive integer.” No extraneous or missing conditions.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No auxiliary definitions; no placeholders except for the proof body (allowed). The use of Int rather than Nat for n is acceptable and consistent with the statement (it even enforces positivity explicitly). The congruence notation is standard Mathlib.
- Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully states the exact mathematical claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` just brings in the math library; no mathematical content to compare.
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_779 (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) (a b : Int) : Int.ModEq n a b ↔ a % n = b % n := by sorry`
  - Variables: `n : Int` with hypothesis `hn : 0 < n` matches “Let n > 0 be an integer.”
  - Variables `a b : Int` match “let a, b ∈ ℤ.”
  - Conclusion: `Int.ModEq n a b` is the standard Mathlib notion of congruence modulo `n` for integers (i.e., a ≡ b (mod n)).
  - `a % n = b % n` expresses that the integer remainders of `a` and `b` upon division by `n` are equal. Given `0 < n`, Lean’s `%` on `Int` indeed corresponds to the usual remainder in Euclidean division with `0 ≤ r < n`.
  - The statement is an “if and only if,” matching the bidirectional claim.

Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement: “Let n > 0 be an integer and let a, b ∈ ℤ. Prove that a ≡ b (mod n) iff a and b have the same remainder upon division by n.”
- The Lean statement exactly captures this: same domain (integers), same positivity assumption on n, congruence modulo n on the left, and equality of remainders via `%` on the right, with an equivalence.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; using standard Mathlib definitions (`Int.ModEq`, `%`). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Final comparison:
- The math problems are the same. No differences in assumptions or conclusions. The code is a faithful translation.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `def approx (a b : Real) : Prop := ∃ k : Int, a - b = k`
  This defines a binary relation approx on the real numbers by: a ≈ b if and only if there exists an integer k such that a − b = k (interpreting k as a real via the standard embedding ℤ → ℝ). This matches the intended definition “a − b ∈ ℤ”.

- `theorem approx_equivalence : Equivalence (approx : Real → Real → Prop) := by sorry`
  This states the proposition: approx is an equivalence relation on ℝ (i.e., it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but for our auditing purpose we only assess the statement/translation.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement defines ≈ on ℝ by a ≈ b iff a − b ∈ ℤ and asks to prove ≈ is an equivalence relation. The code defines the relation exactly as “∃ k : Int, a − b = k”, which is equivalent to “a − b ∈ ℤ” under the standard embedding of ℤ into ℝ, and then states that this relation is an Equivalence. This precisely matches the original request.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No auxiliary vacuous placeholders are used; the definition is substantive and standard.
- Using `approx` as a name rather than the symbol ≈ is purely notational and does not change the meaning.
- Using `Equivalence` (the Mathlib/Lean structure for equivalence relations) is appropriate.
- No mismatches or added/omitted conditions.

2) Faithfulness check:
The natural language statement: Let R be a ring and a ∈ R. Show that a·0 = 0 = 0·a. This is equivalent to showing both a·0 = 0 and 0·a = 0. The code provides exactly these two theorems for an arbitrary ring R and element a : R. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given. Using [Ring R] is appropriate (even stronger than necessary, but acceptable) and faithful to “Let R be a ring.” The direction of the second equality is written as 0 * a = 0 rather than 0 = 0 * a, but equality is symmetric, and the instructions allow logically equivalent formulations.

The two math statements are the same in meaning. The Lean code splits the chain equality into two separate lemmas, which is fully faithful to the original. No discrepancies.

  Natural language: For any integer n and integers a, b, c, if a is congruent to b modulo n and b is congruent to c modulo n, then a is congruent to c modulo n. The notation `a ≡ b [ZMOD n]` is Mathlib's `Int.ModEq n a b`.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c ∈ ℤ. Show that if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n).
- The Lean statement matches the transitivity claim but does not assume n is positive; it quantifies over an arbitrary integer n.
- The original explicitly restricts to positive n. While the property holds more generally, the translation omits that restriction.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- Variables a, b, c as integers are correct.
- The use of `Int` and `[ZMOD n]` is appropriate Mathlib notation.
- Missing assumption: n is positive (or at least nonzero/natural). The Lean code allows any integer n, including 0 or negative values. Thus the code states a stronger theorem than the original and is not an exact translation under the strict guidelines.

3) Final check and differences:
- Missing positivity assumption: The original requires n to be a positive integer. The Lean code allows any integer modulus (including 0 or negative), so it is strictly more general. Under the auditing guidelines, this is not a faithful translation.

- Use of [ZMOD n] is correct Mathlib notation for integer congruence.

- Original: Let n > 1 be an integer. The linear congruence a x ≡ b (mod n) has a solution in Z_n whenever the class [a] ∈ Z_n is a unit.
- Lean uses n : ℕ with 1 < n, which corresponds to n > 1 as an integer (standard formalization). 
- a, b are taken as elements of ZMod n, matching the residue classes modulo n. The phrase “the class [a]” in the statement corresponds exactly to a : ZMod n.
- The condition “is a unit” is expressed by ha : IsUnit a.
- The conclusion “has a solution in Z_n” is expressed by ∃ x : ZMod n, ...
- Equality a * x = b in ZMod n is equivalent to the congruence ax ≡ b (mod n), so this matches the intended congruence statement.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only the theorem statement with an unfinished proof (which is acceptable per instructions focusing on translation).

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
- All quantifiers align: for n > 1, for any a, b in Z_n, if a is a unit then there exists x with a * x = b. This is precisely the linear congruence solvability under unit condition.
- Minor formalization difference (natural numbers vs integers) is standard and does not alter the meaning given n > 1.
- No discrepancies found.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  - Let n be an integer with n > 0. Let a, b, c, d be integers. Assume a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n). Then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n) and (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).

- The Lean theorem precisely encodes the same data and conclusions:
  - n is an integer with positivity `0 < n` (faithful to “fixed positive integer”).
  - a, b, c, d are integers.
  - Hypotheses: a ≡ b (mod n), c ≡ d (mod n).
  - Conclusion: both (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n) and (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n), bundled as a conjunction.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; no vacuous placeholders.
- The use of ℤ for the modulus with `0 < n` aligns with “positive integer”.
- The two conclusions match exactly, including the same modulus and operations.
- No extra or missing assumptions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: G is a finite group.
- Theorem `card_pow_prime_of_all_elements_have_p_power_order {p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (h_orders : ∀ g : G, ∃ k : ℕ, orderOf g = p ^ k) (h_card_gt_one : (Fintype.card G) > 1) : ∃ r : ℕ, 1 ≤ r ∧ Fintype.card G = p ^ r`:
  - Assumptions:
    - p is a prime natural number.
    - Every element g in G has order exactly p^k for some natural k.
    - The order of G is strictly greater than 1 (i.e., G is nontrivial).
  - Conclusion:
    - There exists a natural number r with 1 ≤ r and |G| = p^r.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""If G is a finite group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime p, then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.""
- The code matches most parts: finite group, fixed prime p, every element has p-power order, and concludes |G| = p^r with r ≥ 1.
- Key difference: the Lean theorem adds an extra hypothesis `h_card_gt_one` (|G| > 1). The original statement does not include this as a hypothesis; instead it bakes the nontriviality into the conclusion via r ≥ 1. This changes the logical form: the Lean version assumes nontriviality, whereas the natural language version asserts a conclusion (r ≥ 1) that would fail for the trivial group. Thus the Lean statement is strictly weaker than the NL statement and not logically equivalent.
- Other details are fine: using Nat for r with `1 ≤ r` is consistent with ""integer r ≥ 1""; use of Mathlib's `orderOf` and `Fintype.card` is standard; no vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Final comparison:
- They are almost the same in mathematical intent, but the added hypothesis `|G| > 1` is not present in the natural language statement and makes the Lean theorem weaker. Hence, not a faithful translation under the strict guidelines.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

    IsField R ↔ (Set.range (fun u : Units R => (u : R))) = {x : R | x ≠ 0} := by sorry`
  translates to: For a type `R` with a commutative ring structure, `R` is a field if and only if the image in `R` of the coercion map from the group of units `Units R` equals the set of nonzero elements `{x : R | x ≠ 0}`. Here `Set.range (fun u : Units R => (u : R))` is exactly the set of elements of `R` that are units, viewed as a subset of `R`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that a commutative ring R is a field if and only if R^{×} = R \setminus \{0\}.""
- In Lean, `Units R` is `R^{×}`. The set `Set.range (fun u : Units R => (u : R))` is the set of underlying elements of units in `R`. This is the standard way to view `R^{×}` as a subset of `R` for the purpose of set equality. The right-hand side `{x : R | x ≠ 0}` is `R \setminus \{0\}`.
- Thus the statement `IsField R ↔ (...) = {x : R | x ≠ 0}` exactly formalizes: a commutative ring is a field iff the set of units equals the set of nonzero elements.

Checks against guidelines:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. No placeholders aside from the proof `sorry`, which is acceptable as we are auditing the statement, not the proof.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `IsField`, `Units R`, `Set.range`, and `{x | x ≠ 0}`.
- No mismatches: the code quantifies over a commutative ring `R` and states the equivalence precisely as in the natural language statement. Identifying `R^{×}` with its image in `R` as a subset is standard and faithful to the phrasing.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

  • G is a group and finite. p is a natural number.
  • Assumptions: hp: p is prime; hodd: p ≠ 2 (equivalent to p being odd since 2 is the only even prime); hcard: |G| = 2p.
  • Conclusion: Either there exists a group isomorphism between G and Multiplicative (ZMod (2*p)) or there exists a group isomorphism between G and DihedralGroup p. Using Nonempty (G ≃* H) expresses “G is isomorphic to H.” Multiplicative (ZMod (2*p)) is exactly the cyclic group of order 2p (the additive group ZMod(2p) viewed as a multiplicative group). DihedralGroup p in Mathlib is the standard dihedral group of order 2p.

Whole-statement faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If |G| = 2p with p an odd prime, then G ≅ Z_{2p} or D_p. The code states exactly that: for finite G with |G| = 2p, p prime and p ≠ 2, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 2p (formalized as Multiplicative (ZMod (2*p))) or the dihedral group of order 2p (formalized as DihedralGroup p).
- The use of p ≠ 2 instead of an explicit oddness predicate is equivalent for primes. The use of Nonempty (G ≃* ...) is the standard formalization of “is isomorphic to ...”. The identification of Z_{2p} with Multiplicative (ZMod (2*p)) is standard and correct. The notation D_p is matched by Mathlib's DihedralGroup p (which indeed has 2p elements).

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. No placeholders redefining key concepts. Only a theorem statement with assumptions and a disjunction of isomorphism conclusions.
- Uses standard Mathlib structures: Group, Fintype, ZMod, Multiplicative, DihedralGroup, group isomorphism (≃*).

Final comparison:

  Translation: For a positive natural number n, the set of units in ZMod n is exactly the set of those elements x of ZMod n for which there exists a natural number a with x equal to the class of a modulo n and gcd(a, n) = 1.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: For positive integer n, a congruence class [a] in Z_n is a unit iff gcd(a, n) = 1. Hence the set of units Z_n^× equals { [a] in Z_n : gcd(a, n) = 1 }.
- The first theorem matches the “iff” statement, phrased with a ∈ ℕ (which is fine since every class has a natural representative), and requires n > 0 as in the original.
- The second theorem matches the set-level statement. It uses an existential over ℕ representatives, which is equivalent to the standard set { [a] : gcd(a, n) = 1 } because every class has a natural representative and gcd(a, n) is invariant under adding multiples of n.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Use of ℕ for representatives instead of ℤ: acceptable and equivalent, since every class in ZMod n has a natural representative and gcd(a, n) = 1 is preserved under changing representatives by multiples of n. The positivity assumption on n is included.
- Using {x : ZMod n | IsUnit x} (a subset of the ring) instead of the type of units ZMod nˣ is faithful to the phrasing “the set of units in Z_n”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements (with sorry proofs) appear, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

  Natural language: For any finite abelian group G (modeled additively), there exists a natural number n and a function f from `Fin n` to ℕ such that G is (additively) isomorphic to the product (Pi type over a finite index) of `ZMod (f i)`. Since `ZMod m` is a cyclic group of order m (with `ZMod 0` the trivial cyclic group), this states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a finite direct product of cyclic groups. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but that's allowed for translation auditing. Using `∀ i, ZMod (f i)` to model a finite direct product is standard (Pi type over a finite index set is the categorical/product notion used in Lean). This matches the first sentence of the natural language statement.

- Theorem `number_of_isomorphism_classes (n : ℕ) : ∃ (r : ℕ) (ks : Fin r → ℕ), True := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n, there exist some natural number r and a function ks from `Fin r` to ℕ such that True holds. This is completely vacuous: it does not mention prime factorizations, does not define or count isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order n, and does not involve the partition function p(k). The docstring itself says it's an informal placeholder. Thus it does not translate the second sentence of the natural language statement at all.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- First sentence: ""Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups."" The Lean theorem `finite_abelian_group_is_product_of_cyclic` faithfully matches this (up to standard Lean encoding of products as Pi types and cyclic groups as `ZMod m`). No extra unintended restrictions are imposed. It does not address uniqueness or prime-power decomposition, which the original statement did not require in that sentence.
- Second sentence: ""If n = p₁^{k₁} ⋯ p_r^{k_r} is the prime power factorization of n, then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n is p(k₁) ⋯ p(k_r), where p(k) denotes the number of partitions of k."" The provided Lean theorem does not capture any part of this. It neither mentions prime power factorization, nor the counting of isomorphism classes, nor the partition function. The statement `∃ r ks, True` is trivially true and entirely unrelated. The docstring admits it's a placeholder.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. Only the first part is faithfully translated. The second part is missing and replaced by a vacuous placeholder theorem unrelated to the stated counting result. Therefore, overall the translation fails to capture the full natural language statement.

Additional notes on red flags:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the first theorem uses standard Mathlib objects (`AddCommGroup`, `Fintype`, `ZMod`, `≃+`, Pi types). This is fine. The second theorem is a red-flag placeholder: its statement is vacuous and not a faithful formalization.

Conclusion: Partial faithfulness (first sentence OK), but overall not faithful due to the second sentence being completely absent in the formalization.

The `≃+` means an additive group equivalence (isomorphism). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but we only assess the statement/translation.

Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: ""Prove that for integers m,n ≥ 1 with gcd(m,n)=1, one has Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}."" This is precisely the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the finite cyclic group form.
- The Lean code hypotheses: `m, n : ℕ` (natural numbers), `1 ≤ m`, `1 ≤ n`, `Nat.Coprime m n`. These correspond exactly to ""integers ≥ 1"" and ""gcd(m,n)=1"".
- Conclusion: an additive group isomorphism `(ZMod m × ZMod n) ≃+ ZMod (m * n)`, matching `Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}` as groups.

- Using ZMod for Z_m is standard in Mathlib; and using the additive structure `≃+` matches the group isomorphism.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; there is just the single definition/theorem statement. The proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

- Theorem `subgroups_int_are_nz (H : AddSubgroup Int) : ∃ n : Int, (H : Set Int) = { m : Int | ∃ k : Int, m = n * k }`:
  Natural language: For any additive subgroup H of the integers (viewed additively), there exists an integer n such that the underlying set of H is exactly the set of all integer multiples of n, i.e., { m ∈ ℤ | ∃ k ∈ ℤ, m = n*k } = nℤ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that the subgroups of (ℤ,+) are exactly the subgroups nℤ for integers n."" The core classification direction is: Every additive subgroup H of ℤ is of the form nℤ for some integer n. The Lean statement precisely captures this: given H, there exists n with H = {multiples of n}.
- The phrase ""are exactly"" typically also implicitly includes that for any integer n, nℤ is indeed a subgroup. The Lean theorem does not separately assert this direction, but since it identifies H with the set of multiples of some n, it shows (for that n) the set is a subgroup by equality to H. It does not in this statement assert that for every integer n the set of multiples is a subgroup, but that direction is standard and trivial, and the main classification content is correctly captured.
- The choice `n : Int` (not `Nat`) matches the phrasing ""for integers n"". Also, using multiplication `m = n * k` is appropriate in ℤ and coincides with zsmul in the additive structure; commutativity ensures `{n*k | k}` = `{k*n | k}`.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same core mathematical content: classifies additive subgroups of ℤ as nℤ. No vacuous or placeholder definitions. Uses standard Mathlib `AddSubgroup Int` and concrete set of multiples. Minor nuance: the Lean statement covers the ""every H is nℤ"" direction; it does not explicitly state the converse (that every nℤ is a subgroup), though that is immediate and typically part of the background. Given the problem’s wording and the docstring, this is a faithful formalization of the main claim.

Given the above, the translation is faithful with a small nuance about the ""exactly"" wording, hence a near-perfect score.

This is exactly the usual set-theoretic definition of the center Z(Sym_n).

- The equality asserts that the only permutation commuting with every permutation is the identity.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: For n ≥ 3, the center Z(Sym_n) is trivial. The code states: For n ≥ 3, the set of permutations commuting with all permutations equals the singleton {id}. This is precisely the assertion that the center is trivial, expressed as an equality of sets rather than as an equality of subgroups. Using `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` for Sym_n is standard and faithful. Using composition `trans` instead of the group operation `*` is just a notational choice and does not change the meaning; the commuting condition is exactly the same.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/group: Sym_n is represented as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` — standard and faithful.
- Center: Expressed as a set `{σ | ∀ τ, σ ∘ τ = τ ∘ σ}` — matches the definition of the center's underlying set.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line to natural language and assess.
- `theorem perm_isConj_iff_cycleType {σ τ : Perm (Fin n)} : IsConj σ τ ↔ σ.cycleType = τ.cycleType := by sorry`
  Natural language: For permutations σ and τ in S_n (represented as Perm (Fin n)), σ and τ are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type. This matches the first sentence of the statement. Minor caveat: in Mathlib, `cycleType` typically records lengths of nontrivial cycles (excluding 1-cycles), but this still gives a correct characterization of conjugacy in S_n since the number of fixed points is determined by n minus the sum of nontrivial cycle lengths.

- `noncomputable def conjClasses_equiv_cycle_types {n : Nat} : ConjClasses (Perm (Fin n)) ≃ { m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n } := by sorry`
  Natural language: There is a bijection between the conjugacy classes of S_n and the multisets of natural numbers whose sum is n. The comment says these are the partitions of n. This is problematic. As written, `{ m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n }` includes multisets containing zeros, with arbitrary multiplicity, since there is no positivity constraint on parts. That set is infinite (you can add any number of zeros without changing the sum), so it is not the set of partitions of n. Correctly encoding partitions requires forbidding zeros (e.g., using positive integers `ℕ+` or an explicit `∀ k ∈ m, 0 < k`). Also, if Mathlib’s `cycleType` excludes 1-cycles, the raw `cycleType` does not land in multisets that sum to n; one must adjoin the right number of 1’s to reach total sum n. Therefore, both the codomain and the described map are incorrect as stated.

- `theorem num_conj_classes_eq_num_partitions {n : Nat} : Nat.card (ConjClasses (Perm (Fin n))) = Nat.card { m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n } := by sorry`
  Natural language: The number of conjugacy classes of S_n equals the number of multisets of natural numbers summing to n. Again, this is intended to be the number of partitions of n, but the set on the right is not the set of partitions (zeros allowed), and is actually infinite. In Lean, `Nat.card` of an infinite type is 0, so this statement would be false as a translation of the intended finitary counting result.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- First claim (conjugacy iff same cycle type): Faithful.
- Second/third claims (bijection with partitions; equality of counts): Not faithful because the code uses `{ m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n }` without prohibiting zero parts. This set is not the set of partitions of n and is infinite, so the count is wrong. Moreover, if Mathlib’s `cycleType` omits 1’s, the direct “map to cycle type” does not even land in a subtype with sum n without adjustment.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code’s second and third statements do not faithfully encode partitions of n; they over-approximate by allowing zeros, which changes both the bijection target and the cardinality. Additionally, the docstring for the bijection claims the map is “sending a conjugacy class to its cycle type,” which would not match the codomain if cycleType excludes 1’s.

Differences found:
- Partitions are mis-specified as `Multiset Nat` summing to n without excluding zero; should use positive parts (e.g., `Multiset ℕ+` with sum-cast to n, or a positivity predicate).
- Potential mismatch between Mathlib’s `cycleType` (likely excluding 1-cycles) and the stated codomain that sums to n.

Conclusion: The translation fails due to a significant mismatch in encoding partitions and the resulting counting statements, despite the first theorem being accurate.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem is stated for n : Nat with hypothesis hn : 6 ≤ n. This matches n ≥ 6.
- i : Fin n encodes a fixed index i in {0, ..., n-1}, representing {1, ..., n} up to reindexing; this is standard and fine.
- N : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) is a subgroup of the full symmetric group S_n.
- hN_in_A : ∀ σ, σ ∈ N → σ ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) means N ≤ A_n.
- hN_normal : ∀ g τ, g ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) → τ ∈ N → g * τ * g⁻¹ ∈ N means N is normal under conjugation by elements of A_n; i.e., N is normal in A_n.
- hN_proper : N ≠ ⊤ means N is not the full S_n; that is, N ≠ S_n.
- Conclusion: ∀ σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), σ i = i → σ ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) → σ ∈ N. This says: every even permutation fixing i lies in N; equivalently, the stabilizer G_i in A_n is contained in N.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n (i.e., N ≤ A_n, normal in A_n, and N ≠ A_n). Show N contains G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i}.
- Lean code: Encodes N ≤ A_n and normal in A_n correctly via hN_in_A and hN_normal. The conclusion that all σ ∈ A_n fixing i lie in N matches “N contains G_i.”
- Critical mismatch: “Proper” in the natural language means N ≠ A_n. In the Lean code, hN_proper is N ≠ ⊤, i.e., N ≠ S_n. Since N ≤ A_n, this condition is automatically satisfied, even when N = A_n. Thus the code does not enforce N ≠ A_n and therefore allows the non-proper case N = A_n. The theorem proved is strictly stronger (it asserts the conclusion even without the properness condition) and does not faithfully encode the stated assumption.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- The key difference is the improper encoding of “proper.” The code’s hN_proper does not mean N ≠ A_n, but N ≠ S_n. This is a meaningful mismatch in the hypothesis. Everything else (n ≥ 6, i fixed, normality in A_n, the conclusion G_i ≤ N) is appropriately represented. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only placeholder is the proof (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Conclusion: Not a faithful translation due to the improper “properness” condition.

  Translation: Let G be a finite group (G is a type with a group structure and finitely many elements). Let p and r be natural numbers with p prime and |G| = p^r, and r ≥ 1. Assume furthermore that the center Z(G) is finite (an explicit Fintype structure is provided). Then there exists a natural number k with 1 ≤ k such that |Z(G)| = p^k. Proof omitted.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
Original: Let G be a group of order p^r where p is prime and r ≥ 1. Prove that |Z(G)| = p^k for some integer k ≥ 1.
Lean: Requires G finite with |G| = p^r for prime p and r ≥ 1, and concludes |Z(G)| = p^k for some k ≥ 1.
This matches the intended mathematical content. The conclusion uses k : ℕ with 1 ≤ k (equivalent to integer k ≥ 1) and identifies |Z(G)| as a p-power p^k.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- The only extra element in the Lean statement is the hypothesis (hcenter : Fintype (Subgroup.center G)). This asserts the center is finite. Given [Fintype G], Mathlib canonically provides an instance [Fintype (Subgroup.center G)], so this hypothesis is redundant/derivable from the existing assumptions and does not change the mathematical content. There are no vacuous definitions or placeholders; the theorem is stated with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable per the task.
- All other components (prime p, r ≥ 1, group order p^r, conclusion about the center’s order being p^k with k ≥ 1) match exactly.
Thus the translation is faithful, with a minor redundant hypothesis that does not alter the meaning.

Grade rationale: Near-perfect translation; slight redundancy in hypotheses warrants a 9 rather than 10 under strict auditing.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We consider a natural number n.
- `def A_n (n : ℕ) : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) := MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign (α := Fin n))`: Defines the alternating group A_n as the kernel of the sign homomorphism within the symmetric group on `Fin n`. This is a legitimate Mathlib definition of A_n.
- The theorem `normal_subgroup_contains_point_stabilizers` takes:
  - `hn : 6 ≤ n`: the hypothesis n ≥ 6.
  - `N : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))`: a subgroup N of the full symmetric group on `Fin n`.
  - `hsub : N ≤ A_n n`: N is contained in A_n.
  - `hnormal : ∀ g ∈ A_n n, ∀ x ∈ N, g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N`: N is normal in A_n (i.e., closed under conjugation by elements of A_n).
  - `hproper : N ≠ A_n n`: N is a proper subgroup of A_n.
  - Conclusion: `∀ i : Fin n, ∀ σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), σ ∈ A_n n → σ i = i → σ ∈ N`. This states: for every index i and every permutation σ in A_n that fixes i, σ ∈ N. Equivalently, for each i, the point-stabilizer in A_n at i is contained in N.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: For n ≥ 6 and a proper normal subgroup N of A_n, N contains every subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i} for each i.
- The code represents A_n correctly via the kernel of the sign hom.
- N is specified as a subgroup of the ambient S_n with inclusion `N ≤ A_n` and normality relative to A_n via conjugation by elements of A_n; this matches “N is a normal subgroup of A_n.”
- Properness `N ≠ A_n n` matches “proper.”
- The conclusion matches exactly “G_i ⊆ N” for each i, written elementwise: if σ ∈ A_n fixes i, then σ ∈ N.
- Indices i are taken as `Fin n` rather than {1,…,n}; this is a standard formalization choice and is mathematically equivalent.
- No auxiliary definitions are vacuous: `A_n` is correctly defined; no placeholders like `:= True` appear. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the task as we only audit the statement.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence
- No extra or missing hypotheses relative to the statement: n ≥ 6 is present, N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n (encoded by subset, normality, and properness), and the conclusion is exactly that each point-stabilizer G_i (as a subset of A_n) is contained in N.
- The formulation as an elementwise inclusion is logically equivalent to the subgroup containment claim.
- Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Minor notes: Although the mathematical statement (as written) would force a contradiction if N were trivial, this is an issue with the source statement’s content, not with the translation. The Lean code mirrors the source faithfully.

- def rot_matrix (a b : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...: Defines a 2×2 real matrix functionally indexed by i j : Fin 2 as [[a, -b], [b, a]]. The conditional on i = 0 and j = 0 implements the pattern. This matches the intended matrices.
- def G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { A | ∃ a b, A = rot_matrix a b }: Defines G as the set of all matrices of the specified form [[a, -b], [b, a]]. This matches the natural language definition of G.
- noncomputable def G_addsub : AddSubgroup (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := by sorry: Intended to exhibit G as an additive subgroup of the 2×2 real matrices (i.e., closed under + and additive inverses and containing 0). However, this definition is filled with sorry, so it introduces a vacuous object. Moreover, it does not explicitly ensure that the carrier of this AddSubgroup is exactly the set G as defined; the code gives no content.
- noncomputable def complex_add_equiv_G : AddEquiv Complex (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := by sorry: Intended (per the docstring) to be an additive group isomorphism between (ℂ, +) and G (as a subtype). But the actual type is AddEquiv ℂ (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ), i.e., an additive isomorphism with the entire space of 2×2 real matrices, which is not only different from G but also false as a statement. This is a serious mismatch in the type. It is also filled with sorry, making it vacuous.

Step 2: Does the whole Lean code faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: (i) Prove G is a group under matrix addition. (ii) Construct an isomorphism (ℂ, +) ≅ G.
- (i) Using AddSubgroup would be a reasonable way to express “G is a group under addition” (since an AddSubgroup determines the group structure on the subtype). However, the provided G_addsub is defined with sorry and does not even assert that its carrier equals the set G. Thus it fails the guideline that auxiliary definitions cannot be vacuous and must faithfully describe what they claim.
- (ii) The isomorphism should be AddEquiv ℂ (Subtype fun A => A ∈ G) or AddEquiv ℂ G_addsub (the latter after coercing the AddSubgroup to a type). Instead, the code declares an equivalence with the entire matrix space. That is not the same and cannot possibly be proved; it directly contradicts the intended statement. Moreover, it is again vacuous (sorry).

Step 3: Final check — are they the same?
- Differences:
  - Vacuity: Both key constructions (G_addsub and complex_add_equiv_G) are defined using sorry, violating the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate.
  - Wrong codomain for the isomorphism: The code aims for AddEquiv ℂ (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) rather than AddEquiv ℂ (Subtype fun A => A ∈ G) or an equivalent form. This is a fundamental mismatch with the original statement.
  - The code does not ensure that the AddSubgroup constructed is exactly G; even ignoring sorry, the type does not enforce that its underlying set equals the previously defined set G.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It uses vacuous proofs and, more importantly, specifies the wrong target for the additive isomorphism.

What would be faithful:
- Provide G_addsub with carrier = G and the subgroup axioms proved.
- Define complex_add_equiv_G : AddEquiv ℂ (Subtype fun A => A ∈ G) (or equivalently AddEquiv ℂ G_addsub) sending a + ib to [[a, -b], [b, a]].

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Load the mathlib library.
- Docstring: Claims an equivalence between `IsField R` and the condition ""R is nontrivial and every nonzero element is a unit,"" and says this captures the usual axioms: (R, +) abelian group, (R \ {0}, *) multiplicative group, 1 ≠ 0, and distributivity (with these structural axioms assumed via semiring/ring typeclasses).
- `theorem is_field_iff_nonzero_units {R : Type*} [Semiring R] : IsField R ↔ (Nontrivial R ∧ ∀ a : R, a ≠ 0 → IsUnit a) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R equipped with a semiring structure, `IsField R` is equivalent to ""R is nontrivial and every nonzero element is a unit.""

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original statement: Let F be a set with + and ·. Show F is a field iff:
1) (F, +) is an abelian group with identity 0.
2) (F \ {0}, ·) is an abelian group with identity 1.
3) 1 ≠ 0.
4) Distributivity a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c.

What the Lean statement encodes:
- Uses a `[Semiring R]` structure. A semiring has a commutative additive monoid (no additive inverses), a multiplicative monoid (not necessarily commutative), 0, 1, and distributivity.
- The RHS condition is `Nontrivial R ∧ ∀ a ≠ 0, IsUnit a`. This says 0 ≠ 1 (in a semiring, Nontrivial implies 0 ≠ 1) and every nonzero element is invertible. It does not assert commutativity of multiplication, and it does not assume additive inverses.
- The LHS `IsField R` in mathlib is a predicate intended to capture ""R is a field"" (commutative ring with 1, 0 ≠ 1, every nonzero is invertible). In mathlib, equivalences of this sort are valid under `[CommRing R]`, not merely `[Semiring R]`. The commutativity and additive group structure are not part of `[Semiring R]`.

Step 3: Final check — are they the same?
- Missing commutativity on the RHS: The natural statement requires that (F \ {0}, ·) is an abelian group, i.e., multiplication on nonzero elements is commutative. The code’s RHS only says ""every nonzero element is a unit"" and does not assume multiplication is commutative. In a noncommutative division ring (a division ring that is not commutative), the RHS holds, but `IsField R` should be false. So as stated (with only `[Semiring R]`), the equivalence does not capture the requirement that (F \ {0}, ·) is abelian.
- Additive inverses: The natural statement requires (F, +) to be an abelian group. A semiring only provides an additive commutative monoid (no inverses). While `IsField R` on the LHS presupposes ring-like behavior, the context of the theorem is only `[Semiring R]`, which is too weak to reflect the additive group axiom explicitly on the RHS.
- Distributivity: This is part of `[Semiring R]`, so that part is covered by the underlying structure. However, the natural statement was framed without typeclasses; encoding via typeclasses is fine if they faithfully match. Here, using `[Semiring R]` is too weak; `[CommRing R]` (or at least `[Ring R]` plus separate commutativity) is needed.
- 1 ≠ 0: The code uses `Nontrivial R`, which in this context implies 1 ≠ 0; that part aligns with (3).

Conclusion: The code’s theorem statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement. To be faithful, it should at least assume `[CommRing R]` on the ambient structure (to encode both additive group and commutative multiplication) and then the RHS condition `Nontrivial R ∧ ∀ a ≠ 0, IsUnit a` would match (2) and (3) while distributivity and the additive group structure would come from the typeclass. As written with `[Semiring R]`, it’s missing essential commutativity and additive inverses, and so it does not faithfully capture the original equivalence.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholders, but the typeclass context is too weak (Semiring instead of CommRing), and the RHS misses commutativity explicitly, making the translation not faithful though close in spirit. Hence a high but not passing score.

Using set intersection `(H : Set G) ∩ (K : Set G) = {1}` faithfully captures `H ∩ K = {1}` as a set-level statement. This matches the usual mathematical phrasing; alternatively one could state `H ⊓ K = ⊥` as subgroups, but the given natural language uses set notation, so the set-level equality is perfectly faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary defs at all.
- All hypotheses match: group, finite subgroups, orders equal to `m, n`, gcd condition.
- Conclusion matches: intersection is `{1}`. The use of sets rather than subgroup equality does not change the mathematical meaning here; they are equivalent in this context.
- There are no extraneous or missing conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Set up the environment and open the Matrix namespace. Fine.
- `def is_elementary_matrix {n : Nat} (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) : Prop := True`
  - This introduces a predicate intended to mean “M is an elementary matrix,” but it is defined as `True`. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not capture the intended mathematical concept. Red flag per the guidelines.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem nonsingular_real_matrix_is_product_of_elementary_matrices {n : Nat} (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)
    (h : A.det ≠ 0) :
    ∃ (E : List (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)), (∀ M ∈ E, is_elementary_matrix (M)) ∧ A = E.foldr (fun M acc => M * acc) 1 := by sorry`
  - Natural language: For any n×n real matrix A with det(A) ≠ 0, there exists a finite list E of n×n real matrices such that every matrix in E satisfies `is_elementary_matrix` and the product of all matrices in E (folded right with multiplication and identity) equals A.
  - The structure of the statement matches the intended result: “A is a product of elementary matrices.” The use of `det ≠ 0` for nonsingular is standard and acceptable. Representing the product via a list fold with identity is also appropriate.
  - However, because `is_elementary_matrix` is defined as `True`, the quantified condition “∀ M ∈ E, is_elementary_matrix M” imposes no restriction: any list of matrices qualifies. This makes the theorem’s constraint about elementary matrices vacuous.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: “Any nonsingular n×n real matrix A can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.”
- Lean: Same shape, but the key concept “elementary matrix” is replaced by a vacuous placeholder (`True`). Therefore, the Lean statement does not faithfully encode the intended mathematical content. It allows any product of arbitrary matrices, not specifically elementary ones.
- Also, the code does not use Mathlib’s existing notions of elementary matrices (which exist in Mathlib’s linear algebra matrix library), another red flag per the guidelines.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same due to the vacuous definition of `is_elementary_matrix`.
- If `is_elementary_matrix` were properly defined to match Mathlib’s notion of elementary matrices, the theorem’s statement would be faithful. As written, it is not.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definition makes the translation unfaithful, but the overall shape of the theorem matches the intended statement if the placeholder were fixed. This corresponds to a grade of about 6 per the rubric.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library.
- Comment states the classical classification: there is a primitive root in Z_n^× iff n = 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t with p an odd prime.
- `theorem exists_primitive_root_units_zmod_iff (n : ℕ) :` Introduces a theorem for an arbitrary natural number n.
- `IsCyclic (Units (ZMod n)) ↔ ...`: The left-hand side asserts that the multiplicative group of units modulo n, i.e., Units (ZMod n), is cyclic. In group-theoretic terms, this means there exists a generator (which matches the existence of a primitive root in Z_n^×).
- Right-hand side is a disjunction of cases: `n = 2 ∨ n = 4 ∨ (∃ p t, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ 1 ≤ t ∧ n = p ^ t) ∨ (∃ p t, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ 1 ≤ t ∧ n = 2 * p ^ t)`. This encodes exactly the forms 2, 4, p^t, 2 p^t with p a prime not equal to 2 (i.e., odd prime) and t ≥ 1.
- `by sorry`: No proof provided; this does not affect the statement’s content for our translation audit.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The phrase “There is a primitive root in the multiplicative group Z_n^×” is correctly modeled by `IsCyclic (Units (ZMod n))` because a primitive root (a generator of the unit group) exists iff the unit group is cyclic.
- The conditions on n are correctly encoded: 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t with p odd and t ≥ 1. Using `Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2` is equivalent to “p is an odd prime.”
- The exponent condition `1 ≤ t` matches the implicit “t ≥ 1” in the classical statement.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Critical mismatch: The Lean statement quantifies over all `n : ℕ` with no restriction, thus includes n = 0. For n = 0, `Units (ZMod 0)` is the group of units of Z (±1), which is cyclic, so the left side is true, whereas the right side is false (0 is not one of the listed forms). The natural language statement, by standard mathematical convention, only considers Z_n^× for n ≥ 1. This domain mismatch means the Lean statement is not a faithful translation as-is.
- Minor note: The natural language statement does not include n = 1 among the forms; neither does the Lean RHS. This matches the given phrasing (even though some references include n = 1 in the classification). So that part is consistent with the provided text.

Conclusion: Nearly perfect except for the missing restriction `n ≠ 0` (or `0 < n`). This domain issue makes the translation not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variables {F : Type*} [Field F] {n : Type*} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: We work over a field F and an index type n that is finite with decidable equality. Matrices are n×n matrices over F.
- `theorem H_is_subgroup (G : Subgroup ((Matrix n n F)ˣ)) : ∃ H : Subgroup ((Matrix n n F)ˣ), ∀ A : (Matrix n n F)ˣ, A ∈ H ↔ A ∈ G ∧ (det (A : Matrix n n F) = 1 ∨ det (A : Matrix n n F) = -1) := by sorry`:
  This states: given G a subgroup of the group of invertible n×n matrices over F (modeled as the group of units of the matrix ring), there exists a subgroup H of the same ambient group such that for every invertible matrix A, A ∈ H if and only if A ∈ G and det(A) = 1 or -1. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL: Let F be a field, G ⊆ GL_n(F) a subgroup, define H = {A ∈ G : det A = ±1}. Prove H is a subgroup of G.
- Lean: For G a subgroup of ((Matrix n n F)ˣ) (the group of invertible matrices), there exists a subgroup H of the same ambient group whose elements are exactly those A in G with det(A) = 1 or -1.

This Lean statement captures exactly the set-theoretic definition of H by a membership equivalence, and by construction H is a subgroup of the ambient group. Moreover, since membership in H implies membership in G, it follows that H ≤ G (H is a subgroup of G in the usual mathematical sense: a subgroup whose underlying set is contained in G). The theorem asserts the existence of the subgroup structure on that set, which is precisely what “prove H is a subgroup” requires.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Ambient group: The code uses ((Matrix n n F)ˣ) instead of Mathlib’s GL n F. These are canonically isomorphic notions of GL_n(F). This is an acceptable modeling choice and does not change the mathematical content.
- Formulation: The NL defines H explicitly; the Lean states existence of a subgroup H with the exact membership characterization. This is equivalent to giving the subgroup structure on that set and is faithful to the original.
- Inclusion in G: The Lean does not state “H ≤ G” explicitly, but it follows immediately from the membership equivalence.
- Auxiliary definitions: None introduced; no vacuous placeholders except the proof (which is allowed to be omitted as per instructions).

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully encodes the mathematical statement.

  - swap i j: swap rows i and j.

  - addMul i j c: replace row i by row i + c * row j.
  This is intended to model the three standard row operations.
- axiom applyElemRowOp: Declares (without defining) a function that applies an ElemRowOp to a matrix to produce a new matrix.
- axiom elemMatrixOfOp: Declares (without defining) a function that assigns to each ElemRowOp a matrix (intended to be the elementary matrix corresponding to the operation, i.e., obtained by applying the op to the identity).
- theorem elementary_row_op_left_mul: For any semiring R, any natural n, matrices A, B, any op : ElemRowOp R n, if h : B = applyElemRowOp op A, then B = (elemMatrixOfOp op) * A. Proof omitted (sorry).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural-language statement:
- Natural-language statement: For any positive integer n, if A is n×n and B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, then B = U A, where U is the corresponding elementary n×n elementary matrix of the same type.

Comparisons and issues:
1) Domain of scalars: The Lean statement quantifies over [Semiring R] and allows scaling by an arbitrary c : R (ElemRowOp.scale i c). In standard definitions, an elementary row operation scaling a row requires c to be a unit (or at least nonzero over a field). Allowing c = 0 (or nonunits) makes the operation non-invertible and is typically not considered an elementary row operation. Hence the code broadens the notion beyond the standard “elementary” operations mentioned in the statement. This is a substantive mismatch.
2) Positive n vs any n: The Lean code allows n : Nat (including n = 0), while the statement explicitly says positive integer n. This is a small but real mismatch (the Lean theorem is strictly stronger and includes a degenerate case not covered by the statement).
3) Axiomatized placeholders: Both applyElemRowOp and elemMatrixOfOp are declared as axioms with no definitions or properties tying them to each other. There is no guarantee in the code that elemMatrixOfOp op is actually the matrix obtained by applying op to the identity, nor that applyElemRowOp corresponds to left-multiplication by that matrix. The comment claims this, but there is no formal content enforcing it. Under the audit guidelines, such undeclared/axiomatized placeholders count as vacuous stand-ins and are a red flag.
4) Missing constraints on indices: swap and addMul do not require i ≠ j. While allowing i = j is a harmless generalization (yielding identity or trivial updates), it still differs from typical textbook definitions (though less severe than item 1).
5) Proof omitted is allowed by the task, but the auxiliary entities are not defined, so the statement’s meaning relies on uninterpreted constants.

Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean formalization generalizes n to include 0 and uses a much broader notion of row scaling (any c in a semiring) than the standard “elementary row operation” (usually c a unit or c ≠ 0 over fields). Moreover, the key objects (applyElemRowOp and elemMatrixOfOp) are axioms without the required semantic link. Thus, the code does not faithfully encode the natural-language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language and assess it.
- import Mathlib: Using Mathlib.
- The module docstring restates the intended mathematical claim.
- open Multiplicative: We will use the Multiplicative type alias to switch between additive and multiplicative notation.

First theorem:
- theorem infinite_cyclic_add_group_iso_Int {G : Type*} [Add G] [Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ]
  (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative G)) (hn : ¬ Nonempty (Fintype G)) :
  Nonempty (AddEquiv G Int) := by sorry

Natural language reading:
- Let G be a type with an addition operation (only [Add G], no further group axioms assumed), and let Multiplicative G carry a ℤ-power operation ([Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ]). Assume Multiplicative G is cyclic (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative G)). Assume G is not finite (hn : ¬ Nonempty (Fintype G)). Then there exists an additive equivalence between G and ℤ.

Second theorem:
- theorem finite_cyclic_add_group_iso_zmod {G : Type*} [Add G] [Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ]
  [Fintype G] (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative G)) :
  ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ Nonempty (AddEquiv G (ZMod n)) := by sorry

Natural language reading:
- Let G be a type with addition [Add G] and a ℤ-power operation on Multiplicative G, and suppose G is finite ([Fintype G]) and Multiplicative G is cyclic. Then there exists a positive natural number n and an additive equivalence between G and ZMod n.

Step 2: Compare to the original statements.
Original:
- Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ.
- Any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ_n for some positive integer n.

Issues and mismatches:
1) Missing group structure on G:
- The original speaks about “cyclic groups,” which are groups (with associativity, identity, inverses). In Lean, this should be modeled with [AddGroup G] (or [Group G] and an appropriate wrapper like Additive/Multiplicative) and the corresponding structure for cyclicity. The code only assumes [Add G] (mere hasAdd), not [AddGroup G] or even [AddMonoid G]. Thus it does not encode that G is a group at all.

2) Use of IsCyclic with only [Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ]:
- The code stipulates [Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ] and asserts IsCyclic (Multiplicative G). In Mathlib, IsCyclic is a notion for algebraic structures like groups/monoids with appropriate operations; simply postulating a pow structure is not the usual or sufficient way to capture “cyclic group.” This drastically weakens and potentially changes the meaning: it no longer requires the group axioms—only an arbitrary ℤ-power structure is assumed. This is a serious mismatch from “cyclic group.”

3) Isomorphism notion:
- The conclusions are stated as Nonempty (AddEquiv G Int) and Nonempty (AddEquiv G (ZMod n)), which express additive isomorphisms. Using AddEquiv is fine if G is indeed an additive group; but the hypotheses never assume [AddGroup G], so the theorem is not correctly tied to group isomorphisms. In the intended setting, one should require the group structure and then assert a group (additive) isomorphism. Here, it claims an additive isomorphism from much weaker assumptions.

4) Infinite vs finite:
- For “infinite,” the code uses hn : ¬ Nonempty (Fintype G); this is an unusual but acceptable proxy for “not finite type.” Mathlib typically uses Infinite G or Finite G. This is not the main issue, but it’s a red flag on faithfulness/precision.

5) The existence of n and 0 < n in the finite case matches the statement’s “for some positive integer n,” so that part of the quantification is fine. However, again, the hypotheses about G being a group are missing and replaced by the weak [Add G] and a pow structure.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The Lean statements do not faithfully formalize “cyclic group” because they lack the appropriate group typeclasses and replace them with a bare additive structure plus a ℤ-power on Multiplicative G. This substantially changes the meaning and weakens the hypotheses. The conclusions are cast as additive equivalences without ensuring G has group structure.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the original statements.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced, but the typeclass assumptions are too weak and do not capture “cyclic group.” This is a significant mismatch. The overall intent is close, but the formalization is incorrect in essential ways. Hence a low-to-mid grade is appropriate.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- We work with matrices of size n×n over a semiring R, where n is a finite type (so we have finite matrices) and decidable equality on indices.
- G is a subset of Matrix n n R.
- Assumptions:
  - G is nonempty.
  - G is closed under multiplication: if A ∈ G and B ∈ G then A * B ∈ G.
  - G is closed under two-sided inverses: for every A ∈ G there exists B ∈ G with A * B = 1 and B * A = 1.
- Conclusion: the identity matrix 1 ∈ G.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Let G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) be nonempty and closed under products and inverses (i.e., a matrix group). Prove that I ∈ G.
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly that identity belongs to G under nonemptiness, closure under multiplication, and closure under inverses (explicitly as existence of a two-sided inverse in G for each element). This captures the intended meaning of “closed under inverses” in the context of a matrix group.
- The only difference is generality: the Lean version works over an arbitrary semiring R rather than specifically ℝ, and allows any finite index type n rather than n ∈ ℕ. Both are standard generalizations in Mathlib and do not change the mathematical content of the claim; they strengthen it.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Differences:
  - Scalar ring: ℝ in the statement vs an arbitrary semiring R in Lean. This is a generalization, not a mismatch.
  - Index type: Lean uses a general finite type n; this is equivalent to n×n matrices for some natural number dimension and is standard in Mathlib.
  - Inverse closure is stated via existence of two-sided inverses in G (A * B = 1 and B * A = 1), which is exactly the usual notion of inverse for matrices and faithful to “closed under inverses.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions; the theorem statement matches the intended content.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful, with a harmless generalization to arbitrary semirings and finite index types.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def gl (n : Type _) [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] := { A : Matrix n n Real // Matrix.det A ≠ 0 }`
  This defines gl(n) as the subtype of n×n real matrices with nonzero determinant. Here `n` is an index type with finitely many elements; this is the standard mathlib way to represent n×n matrices (as functions `n → n → ℝ`). This matches the set `{A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A ≠ 0}` in the natural language statement.

- `instance {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] : Group (gl n) := by sorry`
  This asserts that `gl n` has a group structure. However, the instance is provided by `sorry` (proof omitted), and crucially, the instance does not specify that the group operation is inherited from matrix multiplication. A `Group` instance must supply a multiplication, identity, inverses, and the axioms, but since it's constructed via `sorry`, there is no guarantee that the multiplication is the usual matrix multiplication restricted to `gl n`. In other words, this Lean statement merely asserts that there exists some group structure on `gl n`, not that it is the group under matrix multiplication.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement is: Show that GL(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A ≠ 0} is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The Lean definition of `gl n` correctly matches the set described in the NL statement.
- The Lean code then claims `Group (gl n)`, but it does not specify nor enforce that the group law is matrix multiplication. The phrase ""under matrix multiplication"" is essential to the mathematical meaning. A random or arbitrary group structure on this set would not fulfill the statement. Therefore, the translation is not faithful: it proves (by axiom) that `gl n` admits a group structure, not that it is a group with the specific operation induced by matrix multiplication.

Additional considerations:
- Using a type `n` with `[Fintype n]` instead of a natural number dimension is standard and acceptable.
- The auxiliary definition `gl` is legitimate and faithful. The only red flag is the `Group` instance created via `sorry` without tying the operation to matrix multiplication.
- Mathlib already has `GeneralLinearGroup` as the units of the matrix ring; while not required, using it would naturally encode the group structure via multiplication. The current code does not leverage that and thus fails to pin down the intended operation.

Final check:
- Are the two statements the same? No. The Lean code asserts the existence of some group structure on the set, not that the group operation is matrix multiplication. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- The NL statement sets up: Let A ∈ O(n) (orthogonal group), written by its column vectors A = [A1 | A2 | ... | An] with Ai ∈ R^n, and then asks to “Prove the following” (though the specific claim is not provided). Even with the incomplete target, the context clearly involves orthogonal matrices, their columns, properties like orthonormality, etc.
- The Lean code does not mention matrices, O(n), columns, R^n, orthogonality, or any related concepts. It simply proves `True`.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is entirely unrelated to the topic. It neither sets up nor proves anything about O(n) or column vectors. There are no auxiliary definitions to assess; the single theorem is vacuous relative to the stated topic. Thus, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: Completely unrelated to the natural language statement ⇒ 0.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: Bring in Mathlib and open the `Equiv` namespace for permutations.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem sym_group_generated_by_transposition_and_ncycle (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) [NeZero n] :
    ∃ c : Equiv.Perm (Fin n),
      Subgroup.closure ({Equiv.swap (0 : Fin n) (1 : Fin n), c} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) := by
    sorry`
  Natural language: For a natural number n with 2 ≤ n (and additionally assuming n ≠ 0), there exists a permutation c on the set Fin n such that the subgroup generated by the set {swap(0,1), c} is the entire permutation group on Fin n.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: For n ≥ 2, Sym_n is generated by S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}. That is, the specific transposition (1 2) together with the specific n-cycle (1 2 3 ... n) generate the whole symmetric group.
- Lean statement: Asserts existence of some c such that {swap(0,1), c} generates the whole group. It does not specify that c is the specific n-cycle (0 1 2 ... n−1), nor that c is an n-cycle at all.
- Indexing difference (1..n vs 0..n−1) is harmless and acceptable.
- Extra hypothesis `[NeZero n]` is redundant given `2 ≤ n` but not harmful.
- The key mismatch: The Lean theorem is strictly weaker (∃ c ...) than the original, which names a particular element (the n-cycle). The Lean code does not capture the requirement that the second generator is the n-cycle.

3) Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? No. The Lean code proves only that there exists some element c such that together with the transposition (0 1) it generates the whole symmetric group, whereas the natural language requires that the specific n-cycle (1 2 3 ... n) be the generator along with the transposition. This is a substantive difference.

No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; mathlib terms are used properly. The failure is the existential ""c"" replacing the specific n-cycle.

- instance O_group (n : Nat) : Group (O n) := by ...: Declares that O(n) carries a group structure. The accompanying comment explicitly states the intended structure is the one inherited from matrix multiplication, with inverse Aᵀ, and closure/associativity coming from matrix multiplication and the identities (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T.

Step 2: Whole translation vs original statement
- The natural language claim is: Using the identities (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T, prove that O(n) = {A : A A^T = I} is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The Lean code defines the same set O(n) and then asserts it is a Group, which in Lean means there is a multiplication, identity, and inverse operations with the group axioms. Given O(n) is a subtype of matrices, the intended multiplication is inherited (matrix multiplication), identity is the identity matrix, and inverse is transpose; the comment indicates exactly this intended structure. While the proof is omitted (sorry), we only check the statement/translation.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Set definition: Exact match (A Aᵀ = I).
- Claim: ""is a group under matrix multiplication"" vs an instance Group (O n). In Lean, providing a Group instance on a matrix subtype is exactly the formalization of “is a group,” and the natural/implicit operation is the inherited matrix multiplication. The comment clarifies that. There are no extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions. The presence of sorry is in the proof/instance body and does not alter the statement being formalized.
- No mismatch or weakening: The code does not introduce any different structure or alternative operation; it formalizes precisely the intended mathematical claim.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib: Uses mathlib library.
- open Matrix: Opens the Matrix namespace (not essential for the statement).
- variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]: We work with matrices indexed by a finite type n with decidable equality (mathlib standard in place of Nat via Fin n).
- theorem SL_is_subgroup {R : Type _} [CommRing R] : ∃ H : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ), H.carrier = { u : (Matrix n n R)ˣ | Matrix.det (u : Matrix n n R) = 1 } := by sorry
  Natural language: For any commutative ring R, there exists a subgroup H of the group of units of n×n matrices over R such that the underlying set of H is exactly the set of invertible matrices u with determinant equal to 1. In other words, the subset of GL(n, R) consisting of matrices of determinant 1 is a subgroup of GL(n, R). The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original: Show that SL(n) = {A in Mat_{n×n}(R) : det A = 1} is a group under matrix multiplication, for R = ℝ.
Lean theorem: Establishes that the set of invertible matrices with determinant 1 forms a subgroup of (Matrix n n R)ˣ (the group of units), i.e., GL(n, R). Since det A = 1 implies A is invertible over any commutative ring (hence over ℝ), the set {A : Matrix | det A = 1} coincides with the subset of GL(n, R) with det = 1. A subgroup of the units with carrier equal to those elements precisely formalizes “is a group under matrix multiplication.” The operation in the units group corresponds to matrix multiplication of the underlying matrices.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain: The Lean statement is more general (any commutative ring R) than the original (R = ℝ). This is a strengthening and faithful to the original claim.
- Indexing: Lean uses an arbitrary finite index type n rather than a natural number, standard in mathlib and equivalent to considering n×n matrices.
- Formulation: The Lean statement expresses subgroup of the group of units rather than a group structure directly on the set of matrices. This is the correct formalization in mathlib and is equivalent to the natural-language assertion that the set is a group under matrix multiplication.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof, which is allowed by the auditing rules.
Conclusion: The translation is faithful to the mathematical meaning of the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def MyGL (n : Type _) [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] : Type _ := { A : Matrix n n ℝ // IsUnit A }`
  This defines GL(n) as the subtype of n×n real matrices that are units (i.e., invertible). This is a standard faithful encoding of GL(n, ℝ).
- `def MyO (n : Type _) [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] : Set (MyGL n) := { A : MyGL n | (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ) * (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ)ᵀ = 1 }`
  This defines the orthogonal group O(n) as the subset of GL(n) consisting of those invertible matrices A such that A times its transpose equals the identity matrix. Here `A.1` is the underlying matrix of the `MyGL` element; `ᵀ` is transpose; `1` is the identity matrix. This matches the usual characterization AAᵀ = I.
- `theorem MyO_eq ... : MyO n = { A : MyGL n | (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ) * (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ)ᵀ = 1 } := by sorry`
  This states exactly that O(n) equals the set of elements of GL(n) satisfying AAᵀ = I. Since `MyO` was defined to be that set, this equality is definitional (rfl) in this encoding; the `sorry` is for the proof, which isn't required for translation fidelity per the instructions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: ""Prove that O(n) = {A ∈ GL(n) : AAᵀ = I}."" The Lean code defines MyO(n) precisely as that subset of GL(n), and the theorem asserts the equality. So the formal statement matches the natural language statement verbatim.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code uses a custom `MyGL` as the subtype of invertible matrices via `IsUnit`, which is a faithful representation of GL(n). It does not use mathlib's `GeneralLinearGroup`, but this is acceptable under the guidelines since the concept is defined correctly.
- The field is ℝ, consistent with the usual O(n) over the reals.
- The theorem is tautological because of the chosen definition, but the task is to check translation of the statement, not the nontriviality of the proof. There are no vacuous placeholders in the definitions; no red flags.
- No mismatch in content: the equation O(n) = {A in GL(n) : AAᵀ = I} is exactly what is stated.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Dimensions: both are 2×2 real matrices, consistent with Fin 2 indices and ℝ.
- Definition of O(2): encoded as Hᵀ H = I, standard and equivalent.
- Definition of SO(2): encoded by orthogonality plus determinant 1; equivalent to set membership.
- Both products addressed: yes, both H0 H and H H0.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The statement to translate: “Prove that SO(n) = {A in O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group.” In standard terms, this means show SO(n) is a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ), i.e., closed under multiplication and inverses and contains the identity; equivalently, give a Subgroup structure in the ambient group of invertible matrices.
- The code defines the sets O and SO as subsets of Units (Matrix n n ℝ), which is a standard ambient group for matrix groups. It thus captures the right ambient context and the correct set description for SO(n).
- The crucial part—exhibiting SO(n) as a subgroup—is exactly what SO_subgroup is supposed to do. But it is left as sorry, i.e., vacuous. According to the guidelines, any auxiliary definition that is a placeholder (sorry) causes failure. Moreover, because the subgroup is not actually tied to the set SO in the provided code (no fields specified; it could, in principle, be any subgroup), the translation is not completed.
Other considerations:
- Using Units (Matrix ...) instead of mathlib’s GeneralLinearGroup or OrthogonalGroup/SpecialOrthogonalGroup is non-idiomatic but acceptable if done faithfully. Here the set-level definitions O and SO are mathematically sound.
- The equality SO(n) = {A in O(n) | det = 1} is encoded by the definition of SO directly; they did not use O inside the definition, but they restated the orthogonality condition, which is equivalent. That’s fine.
Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Intended: show SO(n) is a subgroup (a matrix group).
- Code: attempts to define that subgroup but leaves it as sorry. This is a vacuous/omitted proof/definition and fails the faithful translation requirement.
Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous subgroup definition.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Let A ∈ O(n) with columns A₁, …, Aₙ. Deduce that {A₁, …, Aₙ} is an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ.” This includes two parts:
- Orthogonality/normalization of columns (orthonormality).
- Basis property (they span ℝⁿ or equivalently are linearly independent since there are n of them in ℝⁿ).

The Lean theorem captures only the orthonormality part via the δᵢⱼ dot products. It does not assert that the columns form a basis of ℝⁿ (no statement about spanning or linear independence, nor an explicit basis object). Thus it is an incomplete translation of the intended “orthonormal basis” conclusion.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: Assumption A ∈ O(n) is represented by Aᵀ A = I. Conclusion that columns are orthonormal is correctly encoded.
- Different: The code omits the “basis” part (spanning/linear independence) of the conclusion “orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ.” No claim that the columns form a basis is made.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and Matrix namespace.
- The theorem `exists_diagonal_subgroup` is stated for a finite index type `n` with decidable equality, and a commutative ring `R`. It asserts: there exists a subgroup `H` of the group of units of the matrix ring `Matrix n n R` such that an element `u : Units (Matrix n n R)` belongs to `H` if and only if all its off-diagonal entries are zero, i.e., `∀ i j, i ≠ j → (u : Matrix n n R) i j = 0`.
- In other words, `H` is precisely the set of invertible matrices whose off-diagonal entries vanish, i.e., the diagonal invertible matrices. This is exactly characterizing the set D(n) of diagonal matrices inside GL(n) (here GL(n) is modeled as the units of the matrix ring). The existence of such a subgroup means that this set is closed under group operations (product, inverse) and contains the identity, i.e., it is a subgroup of GL(n).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: “Let D(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in GL(n). Show that D(n) is a matrix group.” Typically, a “matrix group” means a subgroup of GL(n) (with matrix multiplication). The Lean statement asserts existence of a subgroup of `Units (Matrix n n R)` whose underlying set is exactly the diagonal invertible matrices. This is exactly the same as proving that the set of diagonal matrices in GL(n) forms a subgroup.
- The code uses `Units (Matrix n n R)` for GL(n), which is standard and faithful. Membership is characterized by off-diagonal entries being zero, which is the definition of diagonal. Restricting to units ensures we are indeed inside GL(n).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Scope/base ring: The Lean code allows any commutative ring `R` and any finite index type `n` (not just `Fin n`). The natural statement usually assumes a field or at least a ring; taking a commutative ring includes common cases (fields) and is not weaker in a way that breaks faithfulness. It is a standard generalization and still proves exactly that the set of diagonal invertible matrices forms a subgroup of GL(n, R).
- Representation of GL(n): The code uses `Units (Matrix n n R)` rather than Mathlib’s `GeneralLinearGroup`. This is a standard equivalent representation and faithful to the intent.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; the only item is a theorem with an unfilled proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement: it asserts the existence of a subgroup of GL(n) consisting precisely of diagonal invertible matrices, i.e., D(n) is a matrix group.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- Comment: Summarizes the intended statement: a ring iff additive abelian group, multiplicative monoid, and distributivity.
- theorem ring_iff_group_monoid_distrib {R : Type _} [Add R] [Mul R] : ... := by sorry
  Natural language: For a type R equipped with an addition operation (+) and a multiplication operation (*), the following are equivalent:
  • There exists a ring structure on R (Nonempty (Ring R)).
  • There exists an additive commutative group structure on R (Nonempty (AddCommGroup R)), and there exists a monoid structure on R (Nonempty (Monoid R)), and for all a b c : R, the two distributivity laws hold using the ambient + and *: a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c and (b + c) * a = b * a + c * a.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement fixes a set R with two binary operations + and ·, and asserts: R is a ring if and only if (1) (R, +) is an abelian group with identity 0; (2) (R, ·) is a monoid with identity 1; and (3) both distributivity laws hold, all with respect to those same two fixed operations.

Issues in the Lean code:
- The theorem declares [Add R] and [Mul R], thereby fixing specific + and * used in the distributivity hypotheses.
- However, it quantifies Nonempty (Ring R), Nonempty (AddCommGroup R), and Nonempty (Monoid R). Each of these “there exists an instance” statements provides its own operations (add, zero, neg, mul, one) internal to the structures; they are not required to coincide with the externally fixed [Add R] and [Mul R]. Thus the code does not enforce that the additive group and monoid (and the ring) are built from the same + and * used in the distributive laws. This is a crucial mismatch: the original statement demands that all three structures share the same operations.
- Consequently, the Lean statement allows pathological situations where there exist some ring structure on R (with some +₁, *₁), and also distributivity holds for some possibly different ambient +, * (the given [Add R], [Mul R]), and there exists some (possibly different) AddCommGroup and Monoid structures, but none of these are guaranteed to be coherent with the ambient + and *.

Other aspects:
- Using Nonempty is acceptable in principle to hide extra structure (like natCast) bundled in Ring, but only if the operations are tied to the same + and *. Here they are not.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the proof is omitted with sorry, which is allowed per instructions.

Step 3: Final check — are the two statements the same?
They are not the same. The natural language statement asserts an equivalence using the same two binary operations throughout; the Lean code asserts equivalence between the existence of some ring structure and the existence of some additive group and some monoid structure, while the distributivity laws refer to the ambient + and * fixed by [Add R] and [Mul R], with no requirement that these coincide with the operations inside the ring/group/monoid structures. This discrepancy is substantial and changes the mathematical meaning.

Grade rationale: The form of the equivalence and the chosen Mathlib classes (AddCommGroup, Monoid, distributivity) are appropriate, but the failure to tie the structures to the same operations makes the translation not faithful. This is a near miss rather than completely off-topic.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix` set up the environment and open the `Matrix` namespace.
- The docstring states the natural language claim: the elementary matrix obtained by adding t times row j to row i has determinant 1, hence lies in SL(n, R).
- The theorem `elementary_row_add_matrix_mem_SL (n : Nat) (i j : Fin n) (t : ℝ) (h : i ≠ j)` asserts a determinant computation:
  `Matrix.det ((1 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) + Matrix.of (fun a b => if a = i ∧ b = j then t else 0)) = 1`.
  This constructs the matrix which is the identity plus a single nonzero entry t at position (i, j). In standard linear algebra, this is precisely the elementary matrix that, when left-multiplying, adds t times row j to row i, provided i ≠ j. The conclusion `= 1` is exactly the claim that its determinant is 1.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: For 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n and t ∈ ℝ, let E_{ij}(t) be the elementary matrix that adds t times row j to row i. Prove E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n).
- In Mathlib terms, belonging to SL(n, ℝ) is equivalent to the matrix having determinant 1 (since SL is the special linear group of determinant-1 matrices). The theorem proves `det = 1` for the explicitly constructed matrix matching E_{ij}(t).
- The indices i, j are taken as `Fin n`, which is the standard Lean indexing for n×n matrices; the hypothesis `h : i ≠ j` corresponds to the condition i ≠ j. The bounds 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n from the original are just conventional indexing; `Fin n` encodes “within range” and the presence of two distinct indices is ensured by `h`. This is a conventional difference, not a mathematical mismatch.
- The matrix `(1 : Matrix ...) + Matrix.of (...)` is exactly the identity with an extra t in entry (i, j), i.e., the standard elementary matrix for the row operation described.
- While the theorem’s conclusion is stated as `det = 1` rather than explicit membership in the `SpecialLinearGroup` type, this is logically equivalent to the membership claim. The guidelines allow logically equivalent formulations.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- The only potential nit is that the theorem does not package the matrix and the proof into an element of `SpecialLinearGroup (Fin n) ℝ`, but proving `det = 1` is exactly the defining property of that membership, so it is faithful.
- Use of `Matrix.of` instead of `Matrix.stdBasisMatrix` is non-idiomatic but correct; it constructs the intended single-entry matrix.
- There is no mismatch about the ring (ℝ as in the statement).

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the mathematical statement by proving the determinant equals 1 for the described elementary matrix, which is equivalent to the matrix being in SL(n, ℝ).

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Uses Mathlib.
- structure MatrixGroup (R : Type*) (n : Nat) [Semiring R]: Defines a structure representing a ""matrix group"" as a subset of the units of the ring of n×n matrices over R, with the following fields:
  - carrier : Set (Units (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R)): the underlying set of invertible n×n matrices (units in the matrix ring).
  - one_mem: 1 is in the set.
  - mul_mem: closed under multiplication.
  - inv_mem: closed under inverses.
  This is essentially a custom version of a subgroup of Units(Matrix ...). It is a legitimate, non-vacuous definition.
- def matrix_group_inter {R} {n} [Semiring R] (G H : MatrixGroup R n) : MatrixGroup R n := by sorry: Intended to define the intersection of two such matrix groups as another matrix group, but the body is omitted using sorry. The type returns a MatrixGroup built from G and H, but the definition content is missing.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
Original statement: Let G, H ⊆ GL(n) be matrix groups (each consisting of n×n matrices). Prove that G ∩ H is a matrix group.
- The structure MatrixGroup models “subset of GL(n)” as a subset of Units(Matrix ...), which is a reasonable formalization of GL(n) over a semiring. This part is fine and faithful.
- However, the final declaration matrix_group_inter is problematic in two ways:
  1) It uses sorry, so the construction/proof is omitted. The guidelines forbid vacuous placeholders; this fails that check.
  2) The type of matrix_group_inter does not state that the result is precisely the intersection G ∩ H. It merely produces some MatrixGroup from G and H. The docstring says it's the intersection, but the formal statement does not enforce the carrier to be G.carrier ∩ H.carrier. Without the definition (since it's sorry), we cannot confirm it is the intersection.
Thus, the Lean code does not faithfully capture the exact claim that G ∩ H is a matrix group.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
Differences:
- The code does not explicitly refer to GL(n) as mathlib's GeneralLinearGroup; it uses Units(Matrix ...). This is an acceptable reformulation.
- Crucially, the final definition is left as sorry and the type does not guarantee that the constructed MatrixGroup is the intersection. Hence the formalized statement is weaker and not guaranteed to match G ∩ H.
- Presence of a sorry in the final construction violates the requirement that there be no vacuous placeholders.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The auxiliary definition MatrixGroup is legitimate, but the crucial final construction is vacuous and does not state the intersection property in its type.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def SO2 : Type := {A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // A.transpose * A = 1 ∧ A.det = 1}`
  This defines SO(2) as the subtype of 2×2 real matrices whose transpose times the matrix equals the identity and whose determinant is 1. This is the usual set-theoretic definition of the special orthogonal group in dimension 2 (as a subset of matrices). It does not equip this type with a group structure explicitly.

- `noncomputable def rot_matrix (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...`
  This defines the standard 2D rotation matrix associated to angle θ: [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]].

- `def rotations_set : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := Set.range rot_matrix`
  This is the set of all 2×2 real rotation matrices, i.e., the image of ℝ under the map θ ↦ rot_matrix θ.

- `noncomputable def SO2_equiv_rotations : SO2 ≃ {A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // A ∈ rotations_set} := by sorry`
  This claims the existence of a bijection (an Equiv, i.e., a set-level bijection) between SO2 and the subtype of matrices that lie in `rotations_set`. The construction is left as `sorry`.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The statement says: ""The matrix group SO(2) is isomorphic to the group {ρ_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} of rotations of the Euclidean plane ℝ^2.""
- Key points:
  1) It asserts a group isomorphism (i.e., an isomorphism of groups), not merely a bijection of sets.
  2) The target is the group of rotations of ℝ^2, typically thought of as transformations (or at least as matrices) with group operation being composition/multiplication.

Issues in the Lean code relative to the statement:
- The code only states a set-level equivalence `≃` between types (subsets of matrices). It does not assert or use a group isomorphism `MulEquiv`. Thus, it does not encode the group structure, and therefore does not translate the ""group isomorphic"" part of the statement. This is the main mismatch.
- The target in Lean is `{A // A ∈ rotations_set}`, a subtype of matrices, not explicitly the group of rotations of ℝ^2 as functions/linear isometries. That would be fine if a group structure were provided and a `MulEquiv` were stated, but here only a set equivalence is given.
- The declaration `SO2` is given as a subtype and not equipped with a group structure; again, this is consistent with only providing an `Equiv` and not a group isomorphism.
- The final definition uses `sorry` to produce the `Equiv`. While we don't require proofs, using `sorry` to create a concrete definition (not just a proposition) is a red flag per the guidelines; however, the decisive issue remains that the type is `Equiv` instead of `MulEquiv` and no group structures are invoked.
- Minor: the code does not use Mathlib's `SpecialOrthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ`, which exists and carries the correct group structure. This is acceptable if the custom definition is faithful (it is), but it compounds the group-structure omission.

Final check: Are the two mathematical statements the same?
- No. The Lean code asserts a bijection of sets between SO(2) (as a subset of matrices) and the set of rotation matrices. The natural language statement asserts a group isomorphism between the matrix group SO(2) and the group of rotations. The group structure is not reflected in the Lean statement (no `MulEquiv`, no group instances), so the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- `open Matrix`: Opens Matrix namespace; fine.
- `variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R]`: We work over a commutative ring R. The original statement did not specify the base field/ring; taking a general commutative ring is a plausible generalization.
- `variable {n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: Index type for matrix rows/columns is a finite type n with decidable equality; standard Lean setup.
- `def is_diagonal (A : Matrix n n R) : Prop := ∀ i j, i ≠ j → A i j = 0`: A is diagonal iff all off-diagonal entries are zero. This matches the mathematical notion (though Mathlib already has `Matrix.IsDiag`).
- `def D1 : Set (Matrix n n R) := { A | is_diagonal A ∧ Matrix.det A = 1 }`: Defines D1 as the set of diagonal matrices with determinant 1. This matches the description “diagonal matrices in SL(n)”. Note: Elements with det=1 are invertible in a commutative ring, so this is consistent with SL.
- `def D1_is_subgroup_of_units : Subgroup (Matrix n n R)ˣ := by sorry`: Claims to define a subgroup of the unit group of matrices. However:
  • It contains a sorry (vacuous placeholder), which is a red flag per the guidelines.
  • Crucially, the definition’s type does not mention D1 at all. It produces some subgroup of (Matrix n n R)ˣ without any assertion that its carrier equals {u | is_diagonal u.val ∧ det u.val = 1} or otherwise corresponds to D1. So even if the sorry were filled, this could define any subgroup, not necessarily the one consisting of diagonal det-1 matrices. There is no theorem asserting “D1 is a subgroup” or constructing the subgroup with carrier tied to D1.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to show D1(n), the set of diagonal matrices in SL(n), is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup under matrix multiplication). A faithful Lean translation should define D1 as a subset of invertible matrices (e.g., of `GL n R` or `(Matrix n n R)ˣ`) and then construct a `Subgroup` whose carrier is exactly those matrices, or prove `IsClosed` under group operations, etc.
- The current code defines D1 as a set of matrices, but the final “result” is a generic subgroup of units with no link to D1, and it is left as a sorry. Thus it does not state, let alone prove, that D1 is a matrix group.

3) Final check — same or different?
- Different. Problems:
  • The crucial concluding object is not tied to D1.
  • The final definition uses a sorry, making it vacuous per the auditing rules.
  • It does not use Mathlib’s standard `SpecialLinearGroup` or `Matrix.IsDiag` (not fatal by itself), but the larger issue is the lack of connection between D1 and the subgroup constructed.
  • Even if the sorry were replaced by a complete term, the type as written does not enforce that the subgroup corresponds to D1; it could be any subgroup.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement asserts that the group SO(2) of proper orthogonal 2×2 matrices equals the set of rotation matrices R_θ. The code defines:
- R correctly as the rotation matrix.
- SO2 correctly as the set of proper orthogonal 2×2 real matrices.
- The theorem asserts the exact set equality SO2 = {R(θ) | θ ∈ ℝ}, represented as Set.range R.
No vacuous placeholders are used for the key notions; the only 'sorry' is in the proof, which is acceptable for translation checking. The use of A * A.transpose = 1 (rather than A.transpose * A = 1) is equivalent for square matrices, capturing orthogonality. The determinant condition matches “proper.” The domain/codomain as 2×2 real matrices matches the statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
Yes. The Lean statement SO2 = Set.range R is exactly the claim that the set of proper orthogonal 2×2 matrices equals the set of rotation matrices R(θ), θ ∈ ℝ.

- It returns explicit properties (orthogonality and determinant 1), which is equivalent to being in SO(2). This matches the parenthetical clarification in the NL statement.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib; no mathematical content.
- Module docstring explains the intended statement: sign is multiplicative in S_n.
- `theorem sgn_mul_in_Sn {n : Nat} (hn : 1 ≤ n) : ... := by sorry`
  - Parameters: `n : Nat` with hypothesis `hn : 1 ≤ n`, matching ""Let n ≥ 1"".
  - `let S_n := Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`: Define S_n to be the symmetric group on `Fin n` (permutations of an n-element set). This models the usual S_n on {1, ..., n} up to canonical identification; standard in Mathlib.
  - `∀ α β : S_n, Equiv.Perm.sign (α * β) = Equiv.Perm.sign α * Equiv.Perm.sign β`: For all α, β in S_n, the sign of the product (composition) equals the product of the signs. This precisely states multiplicativity of the sign homomorphism.
  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is allowed per the auditing task; we're checking only the statement.

Whole translation vs original:
- Original: Let n ≥ 1 and S_n the symmetric group on {1, ..., n}. For any α, β ∈ S_n, sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β).
- Lean: For n ≥ 1, with S_n defined as Equiv.Perm (Fin n), for all α, β in S_n, `sign (α * β) = sign α * sign β`.
- The use of `Fin n` instead of `{1, ..., n}` is the standard formalization in Lean and is mathematically equivalent. The group operation `*` on `Equiv.Perm` is composition, matching the usual product in S_n.

Final check for differences:
- Domain: `{1, ..., n}` vs `Fin n`: equivalent modeling of an n-element set; faithful.
- Hypothesis `n ≥ 1` appears in both; in Lean it's present but unused (harmless and faithful to the statement).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement. The codomain of `sign` in Mathlib is the appropriate multiplicative type (±1), so the multiplicative equation is meaningful.
- Conclusion matches exactly: multiplicativity of sgn on S_n.

Verdict: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `let alpha : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 1` defines α as the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in S_3 on the set {0,1,2}. This corresponds to the transposition (1 2) after relabeling {0,1,2} ↔ {1,2,3}.
- `let beta : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := (Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 1).trans (Equiv.swap (1 : Fin 3) 2)` defines β as the composition of swaps (0 1) followed by (1 2). In function terms, this is x ↦ (swap 1 2) ((swap 0 1) x), i.e., β = (1 2) ∘ (0 1). On {0,1,2}, this is the 3-cycle (0 2 1), which corresponds to (1 3 2) under the relabeling {0,1,2} ↔ {1,2,3}. It is the inverse of (0 1 2), hence the inverse of (1 2 3) after relabeling.
- `let G := Subgroup.closure ({alpha, beta} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))` defines G as the subgroup generated by {α, β}.
- The goal `G = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))` asserts that G equals the whole symmetric group S_3 on three elements.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement picks α = (1,2) and β = (1,2,3) in S_3 and asks to show that the subgroup they generate is the whole S_3. The Lean code works in S_3 on {0,1,2}, which is a harmless relabeling. α is exactly the corresponding transposition. β in the code is the inverse 3-cycle (1 3 2) rather than (1 2 3), but generating with β or β^{-1} yields the same subgroup. Thus, the mathematical content is unchanged and the target conclusion G = S_3 is the same.

3) Final check for differences:
- Differences:
  - Indexing: {1,2,3} vs {0,1,2} — benign relabeling.
  - Orientation of the 3-cycle: (1 2 3) vs (1 3 2) — they are inverses, and ⟨α, β⟩ = ⟨α, β^{-1}⟩, so the generated subgroup is the same.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the subgroup closure is the standard Mathlib notion of generated subgroup, and Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) is S_3.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim (up to harmless relabeling and replacing the 3-cycle by its inverse, which is logically equivalent for the generated subgroup).

end noncomputable section
",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The definition `H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` gives an explicit 2×2 real matrix depending on θ, with entries:
  H θ = [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), -cos(2θ)]].
- The theorem `reflection_is_improper_orthogonal (θ : ℝ)` states that for every θ, `transpose (H θ) * H θ = I` and `det (H θ) = -1`. In words: H θ is an orthogonal matrix with determinant −1 (i.e., an improper orthogonal matrix). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but for translation purposes we're only checking the statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement has two parts:
  (a) For each θ, the reflection of ℝ² across the line through the origin at angle θ with the x-axis is a linear operator.
  (b) Its matrix H_θ is an improper orthogonal matrix (i.e., H_θ ∈ O(2) and det H_θ = −1).
- The Lean code addresses (b): it defines an explicit matrix H θ (which is the standard formula for reflection across the line at angle θ) and states it is orthogonal with determinant −1. Expressing orthogonality as AᵀA = I is equivalent to membership in O(2), so this part matches.
- However, the code does not formalize part (a): it does not introduce the reflection map as a function/linear map and state it is linear. While any matrix defines a linear operator, the code never states that H θ is the matrix of the reflection transformation; this link is only suggested by the comment, not encoded in the formal statement. Thus, the “reflection is a linear operator” part is missing as a formal assertion.

3) Final check:
- The code faithfully captures the improper orthogonality of the intended matrix, but it omits the explicit claim that the reflection map is linear and that H θ is its matrix. Since the task requires a faithful translation of the full statement, this omission means the translation is not fully faithful.

Differences:
- Missing formal statement that the reflection map is linear.
- Missing formal identification of H θ as the matrix of the reflection map (only a comment asserts this).

Given these gaps, the translation is close but not fully faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code to natural language:
- `variable (F : Type _) [Field F]`: Let F be a field.
- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Define E(t) to be the 2×2 matrix with entries:
  - E(t)_{0,0} = 1
  - E(t)_{0,1} = t
  - E(t)_{1,0} = 0
  - E(t)_{1,1} = 1
  This is exactly the unipotent upper triangular matrix [[1, t], [0, 1]].
- `def G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F) := range (E F)`: Define G to be the set of all matrices of the form E(t) as t ranges over F, i.e., G = {E(t) | t ∈ F}. (Note: as written, `range (E F)` is intended to denote the image of F under E; conceptually this matches G = {E(t): t ∈ F}.)
- `theorem G_is_matrix_group : ...`: This theorem states three properties of G under matrix multiplication:
  1) The identity matrix 1 is in G.
  2) Closure: if A, B ∈ G then A * B ∈ G.
  3) Inverses: for every A ∈ G, there exists B ∈ G with A * B = 1 and B * A = 1.
  These are the standard subgroup properties (associativity is inherited from matrix multiplication), so this asserts that G is a group under matrix multiplication.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines F a field, E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]], and G = {E(t): t ∈ F}, and asks to prove that G is a matrix group under multiplication. The Lean code exactly defines E and G accordingly and states the subgroup properties that constitute being a group under matrix multiplication.
- No auxiliary definitions are vacuous; E and G are meaningful. The theorem body is `sorry`, but the task is translation, not proof. The statement itself matches the mathematical content.

Potential minor red flag:
- The expression `range (E F)` is syntactically unusual (normally one would use `Set.range E` given the section variables), but its intended meaning is clearly G = {E(t) | t ∈ F}. Given the instructions that the input code compiles, we treat this as conceptually faithful. The formulation of group properties as a tuple of propositions instead of a `Subgroup` structure is acceptable and still faithful to the statement ""G is a matrix group under multiplication.""

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. There are no substantive differences.

Line-by-line translation:
- import Mathlib, open Equiv: Bring in Mathlib and open the Equiv namespace (for permutations, swaps, etc.).
- The theorem statement: For n ≥ 1 and S_n modeled as Equiv.Perm (Fin n), for any list l of permutations, if every element τ of l is a transposition (i.e., there exist distinct x, y : Fin n with τ = Equiv.swap x y), and if the product of the list l equals the identity permutation (1), then the length of l is even.

Interpretation of constructs:
- Equiv.Perm (Fin n) is the symmetric group S_n on n elements (Fin n is {0, …, n-1}, canonically in bijection with {1, …, n}).
- Equiv.swap x y with x ≠ y is exactly a transposition.
- l.prod = (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) expresses that the product of the transpositions in l equals the identity permutation.
- Even l.length states that the number of transpositions used is even.
- The hypothesis hn : 1 ≤ n matches the natural language assumption n ≥ 1.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL: Let n ≥ 1 and S_n be the symmetric group on {1,…,n}. Show every factorization of id as a product of transpositions uses an even number of transpositions.
- Lean: Exactly formalizes this: any list of transpositions in S_n whose product is the identity has even length.
- Modeling S_n via Equiv.Perm (Fin n) is standard and faithful. Using lists to represent products is also standard. Requiring x ≠ y ensures genuine transpositions. The equality to identity is correctly represented. The assumption n ≥ 1 is present. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No extraneous or missing conditions. No misuse of Mathlib notions. No auxiliary definitions. Thus the translation is faithful.

- The theorem statement: `∃ (f : G →* G × H), (∀ x, f x = (x, (1 : H))) ∧ Function.Injective (f : G → G × H)` means: There exists a monoid (group) homomorphism f from G to G × H such that for all x in G, f x = (x, 1), and f is injective as a function.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Show that the map φ: G → G × H given by φ(x) = (x, 1) is an injective homomorphism. In Lean, a homomorphism is represented as a structure `G →* G × H`. Saying that the specific function x ↦ (x,1) is a homomorphism amounts to exhibiting a `MonoidHom` whose underlying function is exactly x ↦ (x,1). The Lean statement does exactly this via an existential quantifier: it asserts existence of such an `f` with the specified formula and injectivity. Thus, it is a faithful formalization of the claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- The NL statement fixes the map φ explicitly and asserts it is an injective homomorphism. The Lean statement asserts there exists a monoid hom f with the exact pointwise formula f x = (x,1) and that f is injective. These are equivalent formulations in Mathlib, since providing such an `f` is exactly providing the homomorphism structure on the function φ.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib `G →* G × H` and `Function.Injective`.
- Hence, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code to natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Using Mathlib and opening matrix namespace.
- variable (F : Type*) [Field F]: Let F be a field.
- abbrev I := Sum (Fin 2) (Fin 2): Define the index type I for 4×4 matrices as a disjoint sum of two 2-element finite sets; this encodes a 2×2 block decomposition.
- def block4 (A B C : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F) : Matrix I I F := Matrix.fromBlocks A B 0 C: Define the 4×4 block matrix with 2×2 blocks [[A, B], [0, C]].
- def Gset : Set (Matrix I I F) := { M | ∃ A B C, M = block4 F A B C ∧ Matrix.det (A * C) ≠ 0 }: Define G as the set of 4×4 matrices of the specified block form with det(AC) ≠ 0.
- theorem block_matrices_form_subgroup : ∃ S : Subgroup (GL I F), ∀ g : GL I F, (g ∈ S) ↔ ∃ A B C, (g : Matrix I I F) = Matrix.fromBlocks A B 0 C ∧ Matrix.det (A * C) ≠ 0: There exists a subgroup S of GL(4, F) consisting exactly of invertible matrices whose underlying matrix is of the block form [[A, B], [0, C]] with det(AC) ≠ 0.

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful to the original statement?
- The natural language statement defines G as the set of block upper triangular 4×4 matrices with 2×2 blocks A, B, C and det(AC) ≠ 0, and asks to verify that G is a matrix group under multiplication.
- The Lean code defines precisely that set Gset and then states the existence of a subgroup S of GL(I, F) whose elements are exactly those matrices of the given block form with det(AC) ≠ 0. This is exactly the formalization of “G is a matrix group,” i.e., G forms a subgroup of GL under matrix multiplication. Using I = Fin 2 ⊕ Fin 2 matches the 2×2 block structure.
- Using det(AC) ≠ 0 rather than det(A) ≠ 0 and det(C) ≠ 0 is mathematically equivalent over a field, and det of the 4×4 block triangular matrix equals det(A) det(C) = det(AC), so the condition also ensures invertibility as required for membership in GL.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Scope/type: The theorem is about a subgroup of GL(I, F), i.e., invertible matrices, which is the appropriate notion of “matrix group under multiplication.” The set Gset is defined in Matrix I I F; the theorem characterizes the corresponding subgroup in GL whose underlying matrices are exactly those in Gset. This matches the intended result.
- Indexing: Using Sum (Fin 2) (Fin 2) instead of Fin 4 is an isomorphic choice facilitating block construction; no semantic difference.
- All auxiliary definitions (block4, Gset) are legitimate and faithful; no vacuous placeholders.
- The theorem statement matches the natural language meaning without adding or omitting conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- `theorem monoid_hom_injective_iff_ker_eq_bot (f : G →* H) : Function.Injective (f : G → H) ↔ f.ker = (⊥ : Subgroup G) := by sorry`
  This states: For a group homomorphism f from G to H (encoded as a `MonoidHom` with group instances), f is injective as a function if and only if its kernel (a subgroup of G) equals the trivial subgroup, denoted by `⊥`.

Assessment of fidelity:
- The natural language statement: ""(Injectivity test for homomorphisms) Prove that if f: G → H is a group homomorphism with kernel K then f is injective iff K is the trivial subgroup.""
- The code precisely expresses this: it uses the standard Mathlib `MonoidHom` for group homomorphisms, `f.ker` for the kernel subgroup of G, `⊥ : Subgroup G` for the trivial subgroup, and `Function.Injective` for injectivity. The equivalence ↔ matches the ""if and only if"".
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; all concepts are standard Mathlib constructs. The presence of `by sorry` is acceptable per the instructions since we only check the statement, not the proof.

Final comparison:
- The mathematical content is identical: f is injective iff its kernel is trivial. The code’s statement is a faithful and standard formalization of the given natural language statement.

Here `alternatingGroup (Fin 5)` denotes A5, and `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` denotes S5. `IsSimpleGroup` is the standard Mathlib notion of a simple group, and `IsSolvable` is the standard notion of solvability for a group.

Assessment of faithfulness:

- This matches the intended content (Chinese remainder theorem at the level of additive groups): an isomorphism of groups between the cyclic group of order mn and the product of cyclic groups of orders m and n, when m and n are coprime. Using `AddEquiv` appropriately encodes a group isomorphism.

3) Differences / potential issues:
- Positivity/finite-order subtlety: The natural language implicitly assumes m,n ≥ 1 because C_n is the cyclic group of order n (which is only defined for n ≥ 1). The Lean statement quantifies over `m n : ℕ` without explicitly requiring positivity. The accompanying comment claims ""ZMod k for the cyclic additive group of order k"", which is only strictly correct for k > 0; `ZMod 0` is isomorphic to ℤ as an additive group (infinite cyclic). However, the type-level statement still makes sense for all `m,n` with `Nat.Coprime m n` (and even in the degenerate case `m=0, n=1`, the additive group statement holds). So the Lean statement slightly generalizes the domain beyond what the natural language strictly defines.
- Structural modeling: The original uses multiplicative notation (`C_n`) for groups, while Lean uses additive groups (`ZMod`) with `AddEquiv`. This is a standard and faithful representation of cyclic groups in Mathlib.
- No auxiliary placeholder definitions: There are no fake/vacuous definitions; only the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (Chinese remainder for cyclic groups), with the minor caveat that it does not restrict to positive `m,n`. This is a small discrepancy but does not change the essence of the statement; it mildly generalizes the domain.

 p is an irreducible polynomial over k, Gal assigns to each polynomial its
 Galois group (as a type endowed with a Group instance), and
 `expressible_by_radicals` is a predicate saying the roots of a polynomial

- universe v u: Universe parameters.
- variable {k : Type u} [Field k]: We fix an arbitrary field k.
- variable (Gal : Polynomial k → Type v): We introduce an arbitrary assignment that sends each polynomial over k to a type, intended to be its Galois group, but with no definition tying it to Mathlib's Galois group.
- variable [∀ p, Group (Gal p)]: Each such type Gal p is given a group structure. Again, no connection to actual Galois groups.
- variable (expressible_by_radicals : ∀ p : Polynomial k, Prop): An arbitrary predicate on polynomials, intended to mean “the roots of p are expressible by radicals,” but it is completely uninterpreted.
- theorem polynomial_roots_expressible_by_radicals_iff_solvable {p : Polynomial k} (hp : Irreducible p) : IsSolvable (Gal p) ↔ expressible_by_radicals p := by sorry: The main statement: for an irreducible polynomial p over k, the group Gal p is solvable if and only if p is expressible by radicals. No proof is supplied (which is acceptable), but more importantly, Gal and expressible_by_radicals are arbitrary, not defined notions.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: Let p(x) be an irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients, G is the Galois group of p, and the complex roots of p are expressible in radicals iff G is solvable.
- Differences:
  - Base field: The Lean code works over an arbitrary field k, not specifically ℚ. This is a generalization, not the same statement.
  - Galois group: The code uses an arbitrary assignment Gal with a Group instance. It does not use Mathlib’s Galois group (e.g., GaloisGroup (SplittingField p) k) nor relate Gal to any splitting field or automorphism group. This is merely a placeholder, not a faithful definition.
  - Expressibility by radicals: The code uses an arbitrary predicate expressible_by_radicals with no definition. It is not tied to the complex roots, nor to radicals over ℚ or over k, nor to any Mathlib notion like radical extensions.
  - Complex roots: The NL statement explicitly refers to complex roots. The Lean code does not mention ℂ or embeddings into ℂ.
- The theorem statement is thus an abstract equivalence between two uninterpreted notions; it does not faithfully encode the mathematical content of the Galois-theoretic criterion.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code does not define the Galois group or radicals in Mathlib terms, uses an arbitrary base field instead of ℚ, and omits any reference to complex roots or radical expressions. It introduces placeholder parameters rather than proper definitions. Even though the equivalence form matches the English phrasing superficially, the formalization is not faithful.

Auxiliary definitions check:
- There are no proper auxiliary definitions; instead, there are arbitrary parameters (Gal and expressible_by_radicals). These are effectively placeholders and do not faithfully define the intended notions.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `axiom A5_nonabelian_simple : Prop`: Introduces an arbitrary proposition named ""A5 is nonabelian simple"" with no content; not tied to Mathlib's `AlternatingGroup` or `SimpleGroup`.
- `axiom S5_is_galois_general_quintic : Prop`: Another bare proposition placeholder for ""the Galois group of the general quintic is S5""; not connected to polynomials or Galois theory in Mathlib.
- `axiom roots_general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals : Prop`: A bare proposition for ""roots of the general quintic are solvable by radicals""; no relation to any formal notion of solvable-by-radicals in Mathlib.
- `axiom S5_solvable : Prop` and `axiom A5_solvable : Prop`: Bare propositions standing in for the groups S5 and A5 being solvable; not defined via `IsSolvable (SymmetricGroup 5)` or similar.
- `axiom solvable_by_radicals_implies_S5_solvable : roots_general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals → S5_solvable`: Assumes as an axiom a bridge between the field-theoretic notion and group solvability, but both sides are placeholders.
- `axiom S5_solvable_implies_A5_solvable : S5_solvable → A5_solvable`: Assumes as an axiom that if S5 were solvable then A5 would be solvable; again both sides placeholders, no group structure.
- `axiom A5_not_solvable : ¬ A5_solvable`: Assumes as an axiom that A5 is not solvable; not derived from simplicity or any group theory.
- Final theorem: `theorem general_quintic_not_solvable_by_radicals (hA5_simple : A5_nonabelian_simple) (hGalois : S5_is_galois_general_quintic) : ¬ roots_general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals := by sorry`. This claims: assuming the two headline facts, conclude the general quintic is not solvable by radicals. Proof omitted.

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful?
- Conceptually, the final theorem mirrors the natural language: from ""A5 simple"" and ""general quintic has Galois group S5"" conclude ""not solvable by radicals."" However, every mathematical notion is replaced by an arbitrary `Prop` axiom, not by Mathlib's actual notions (no `SymmetricGroup 5`, `AlternatingGroup 5`, `SimpleGroup`, `IsSolvable`, no polynomial/Galois group formalization, no radicals). This is exactly the kind of vacuous placeholder the guidelines forbid. Moreover, the intermediate facts are also axiomatized rather than derived. The proof is `sorry` (which is acceptable per the instructions only if the statements/definitions are faithful), but here the statements themselves are not faithfully encoded.

Step 3: Compare the two problems
- Natural language statement: precise mathematical claim involving A5, S5, Galois group of the general quintic, and solvability by radicals.
- Lean code: introduces unrelated placeholder propositions with suggestive names and asserts the conclusion from them, without using Mathlib definitions or tying the placeholders to actual mathematical objects.
- Differences:
  - No use of Mathlib's group-theoretic terms (`AlternatingGroup`, `SymmetricGroup`, `IsSimpleGroup`, `IsSolvable`).
  - No formalization of ""general quintic"" or its Galois group; just a `Prop` token.
  - No formal notion of ""solvable by radicals""; again just a `Prop` token.
  - Additional axioms like `A5_not_solvable` and implication axioms replace real mathematical connections.
  - The theorem relies on placeholders and lacks a faithful formal statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it uses vacuous placeholders instead of proper Mathlib concepts and does not correctly formalize the mathematical content of the statement.

2) Does this faithfully translate the natural language statement?
Original statement: ""If G = H1 × ⋯ × Hn is the internal direct product of normal subgroups H_i, then for any i ≠ j we have H_i ∩ H_j = {1}.""
- Hypothesis mismatch: The code replaces ""G is the internal direct product of normal subgroups"" with the custom predicate is_internal_direct_product_family, which only encodes unique ordered factorization of every element as a product of one element from each H_i. It does not assume (or imply) normality of the H_i, nor does it assume the multiplication map is a group isomorphism (as opposed to a mere bijection of sets). Standard ""internal direct product"" entails that the subgroups commute appropriately (so that the map from the external direct product is a homomorphism) and typically implies normality. The code does not require or mention normality or commutativity.
- Conclusion formulation: The code concludes equality of sets (H i ∩ H j as sets equals the singleton {1}); the natural language statement means the subgroup intersection is trivial. These are equivalent in content, so this part is fine.
- Indexing and quantification match (finite family indexed by i, j with i ≠ j).

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean hypothesis (unique decomposition) is not the same as ""internal direct product of normal subgroups""; it is a different, generally weaker/other notion (akin to a Zappa–Szép/unique factorization condition) and omits the normality requirement entirely. While the conclusion likely follows from the Lean hypothesis, the task is to translate the statement, not to replace the hypothesis with a different one. Also, the code does not use (nor reference) any mathlib notion of internal direct product or normality. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Auxiliary definitions sanity check:
- is_internal_direct_product_family is a meaningful, non-vacuous property, not a placeholder. But it does not faithfully capture ""internal direct product of normal subgroups."" No other auxiliary vacuous defs.

Therefore: not faithful.

The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Does the whole translation faithfully capture the original statement?
No.
- The original theorem is about finite simple groups (actual group structures) and says every such group is isomorphic to one from specific families: cyclic of prime order, alternating A_n for n ≥ 5, families of Lie type (both classical and exceptional/twisted, including Tits), or one of the 26 sporadics.
- The Lean code does not encode group structure at all: G is just a Type, not a Group. There are no typeclass parameters [Group G], [Fintype G], [IsSimpleGroup G], etc. The predicate IsFiniteSimpleGroup is vacuous (True), so the hypothesis h carries no information.
- The target predicate is_isomorphic_to_class is also vacuous (True), so the conclusion carries no information and is always satisfied regardless of what G is.
- The theorem is left as sorry, and even if it weren’t, the vacuous predicates make it trivial and meaningless.
- The tags for classes are extremely coarse. While in principle one could use a tag SimpleGroupClass together with a non-vacuous is_isomorphic_to_class that correctly interprets each tag (including requiring primality for the cyclic_prime case, interpreting classical_lie with all necessary parameters, etc.), the current code does not do this. Moreover, the interface already fails by not carrying a group structure on G, so even with a fixed is_isomorphic_to_class the theorem signature is inadequate.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are different.
- The original is a precise classification of finite simple groups up to isomorphism.
- The Lean code provides only vacuous predicates and a coarse tagging type, with no genuine encoding of groups, finiteness, simplicity, or isomorphism. The theorem quantifies over arbitrary types and asserts a trivial existence using vacuous predicates. It does not faithfully state the classification theorem.

Additional issues:
- Missing prime condition in the cyclic case (could be pushed into is_isomorphic_to_class in a better design, but here it’s vacuous).
- Alternating case at least carries n ≥ 5, but still no linkage to A_n.
- Lie type families are not parameterized (rank, field size, type), so the tagging is very coarse; again, might be okay as a tag only if the interpretation predicate were non-vacuous, which it is not.
- Sporadic indexed by Fin 26 is acceptable as a tag, but again unused.
- The overall statement uses G : Type u without [Group G], which is fundamentally wrong for a classification of groups.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It uses vacuous placeholders for the key notions and lacks necessary structure to even state the theorem correctly.

Grade rationale: Severe use of vacuous definitions; the theorem’s type does not even mention group structure; even fixing the placeholders would require changing the theorem signature and substantially redesigning the auxiliary types. This fits the rubric closer to 3 than 6.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Imports and opens: Using Mathlib, matrices over the reals, and trigonometric functions.
- Theorem srdoty_alg_symmetry_743 (n : ℕ) (hn : 3 ≤ n):
  - Let θ := 2π / n (as a real number).
  - Define r to be the 2×2 real matrix with entries:
    r = [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]], i.e., the standard rotation matrix by angle θ.
  - Define h to be the 2×2 real matrix with entries:
    h = [[1, 0], [0, −1]], i.e., reflection across the horizontal (x-) axis.
  - Claim: r * h * r = h (matrix multiplication). The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is clear.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement sets up D_n (n ≥ 3), defines r as rotation by 2π/n, and h as reflection across the horizontal axis, and asks to prove r h r = h via matrices. 
- The Lean code exactly defines r as the rotation matrix by θ = 2π/n and h as the reflection across the x-axis, and asserts the matrix identity r h r = h.
- The code includes the condition n ≥ 3, matching the statement (although it is not used in the matrix identity, it is consistent with the context of D_n).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; the let-bindings for r and h are concrete and correct.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only contextual difference is that the code does not explicitly mention the dihedral group D_n, but it performs exactly the requested algebraic (matrix) computation that represents elements of D_n and states the target identity. This is in line with the instruction to give an algebraic argument with matrices.
- The equality r * h * r = h is stated exactly as in the natural language problem.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Grade justification: The code precisely encodes the matrices for rotation by 2π/n and reflection across the horizontal axis, and asserts the exact identity r h r = h. No placeholders or vacuous definitions are used. Hence, it is a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: set up standard Mathlib environment and access to equivalences/permutations.
- The theorem states: For a natural number `n` with hypothesis `hn : 2 ≤ n`, consider `Perm (Fin n)`, the symmetric group on `n` letters (here letters are `0,1,...,n-1`). The set of generators is the two-element set containing:
  1) `Equiv.swap (Fin.mk 0 ...) (Fin.mk 1 ...)`: the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in `Fin n` (i.e., the cycle (0 1)). The proofs `0 < n` and `1 < n` are justified from `hn` via `linarith`.
  2) `Equiv.ofBijective (fun i : Fin n => ⟨(i.val + 1) % n, ...⟩) (by sorry)`: the permutation sending `i` to `i+1 (mod n)`, i.e., the `n`-cycle (0 1 ... n-1). The term `⟨(i.val + 1) % n, ...⟩` constructs an element of `Fin n` by giving its value modulo `n` and proving it’s in range via `Nat.mod_lt` (using `0 < n` from `hn`). The `by sorry` is a placeholder for the (true) fact that this map is bijective, which makes it a permutation via `Equiv.ofBijective`.
- The conclusion: `Subgroup.closure {swap(0,1), cycle}` equals `⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))`, i.e., the subgroup generated by those two permutations is the whole symmetric group.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original says: For `n ≥ 2`, `S_n` is generated by the two elements `{(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}`. In Lean, `S_n` is `Perm (Fin n)`. The code uses the transposition `(0 1)` and the `n`-cycle `i ↦ i+1 mod n`. This differs only by relabeling `1..n` as `0..n-1`, which is a harmless indexing shift and standard in formalizations; it describes exactly the same subgroup up to canonical relabeling.
- The use of `Subgroup.closure {…} = ⊤` is precisely the formal way to say “generated by those two elements”.
- No auxiliary fake or vacuous definitions are introduced; all objects are standard Mathlib concepts. The `sorry`s are only for proofs, not for definitions, which is acceptable under the rules (we only audit the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof).

Final check: The two statements coincide in mathematical meaning. The only difference is the 0-based vs 1-based indexing of the underlying set, which is a notational change and does not alter the content.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: Bring in Mathlib and open the namespace for equivalences. OK.
- The theorem:
  `theorem symmetric_group_generated_by_adjacent_transpositions (n : Nat) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
    Subgroup.closure ({ s : Perm (Fin n) | ∃ i : Fin (n - 1),
      let a : Fin n := Fin.cast (congrArg (fun m => m) (by simp [Nat.sub_add_cancel (Nat.pred_lt.2 (by decide))])) i;
      let b : Fin n := Fin.cast (congrArg (fun m => m) (by simp [Nat.sub_add_cancel (Nat.pred_lt.2 (by decide))])) i.succ;
      s = swap a b } : Set (Perm (Fin n))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n))) := by sorry`

  Natural language reading:
  - For a natural number n with n ≥ 2, the subgroup of the symmetric group S_n (represented as `Perm (Fin n)`) generated by a certain set equals the whole group (⊤).
  - The generating set is `{ s | ∃ i : Fin (n - 1), s = swap a b }`, where `a` and `b` are defined (via `let`) in terms of `i` as some elements of `Fin n`, and `swap a b` is the transposition swapping `a` and `b`.
  - The intended meaning is: the set consists of the adjacent transpositions corresponding to positions i and i+1.

  Technical details of the set:
  - `i : Fin (n - 1)` is an index among 0, 1, ..., n-2 (0-based).
  - `i.succ : Fin n` is the successor index in 0..n-1, i.e., i+1.
  - The code tries to define `a : Fin n` from `i` using `Fin.cast (...) i`. However, `Fin.cast : (h : n = m) → Fin n → Fin m` is a cast along an equality of bounds. Here `i` has type `Fin (n - 1)`, and they try to cast it to `Fin n` using an equality produced by `congrArg (fun m => m) (by simp [...])`. This is highly suspicious: to map `Fin (n - 1)` to `Fin n` via `Fin.cast`, one would need an equality `(n - 1) = n`, which is false. Normally, the correct map is `Fin.castSucc : Fin (n - 1) → Fin n`. The same dubious pattern is used for `b`, although `i.succ` already has type `Fin n`, so casting it is unnecessary.
  - The embedded proof term `by simp [Nat.sub_add_cancel (Nat.pred_lt.2 (by decide))]` is also suspect: it seems intended to produce an equality like `(n - 1) + 1 = n`, but that would be used for `Fin (n - 1 + 1) ≃ Fin n`, not `Fin (n - 1) ≃ Fin n`. Moreover, applying `Fin.cast` to `i : Fin (n - 1)` requires an equality with LHS `(n - 1)`, not `(n - 1) + 1`.

  Conclusion on the set:
  - The intended generators are the adjacent transpositions `{swap (Fin.castSucc i) i.succ | i : Fin (n - 1)}`.
  - The code as written uses a convoluted and likely incorrect `Fin.cast` that does not align with the standard and correct `Fin.castSucc`, and appears ill-typed or meaningless if taken literally. Even if the code allegedly compiles per the prompt, the written expression does not clearly or correctly specify adjacent transpositions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: For n ≥ 2, the symmetric group S_n is generated by the adjacent transpositions (1,2), (2,3), ..., (n-1,n).
- Lean statement: For n ≥ 2, the subgroup generated by a set of transpositions `swap a b` indexed by `i : Fin (n - 1)` is the whole group.
- Problem: The elements `a` and `b` in the Lean code are not correctly defined as the adjacent indices i and i+1 in `Fin n`. The correct choice is `a = Fin.castSucc i` and `b = i.succ`. The code uses a dubious `Fin.cast` with an equality that cannot convert `Fin (n - 1)` to `Fin n`. Therefore, the generating set in the Lean statement is not clearly the set of adjacent transpositions and may be ill-defined.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- The overall shape (closure equals top) matches the ""generated by"" claim.
- The index type and the use of `swap` match the idea of transpositions.
- However, the concrete construction of the adjacent pair is incorrect: `Fin.cast` is the wrong tool, and the embedded equality appears unrelated or incorrect. This means the set in Lean likely does not represent the intended adjacent transpositions.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Additional notes:
- A faithful Lean statement should look like:
  `Subgroup.closure {s : Perm (Fin n) | ∃ i : Fin (n-1), s = Equiv.swap (Fin.castSucc i) i.succ} = ⊤`.
- Or equivalently, define the set explicitly using `i : Fin (n-1)` with `a := Fin.castSucc i` and `b := i.succ`.

Grade rationale:
- The intent is very close, and the ambient structures (Perm (Fin n), closure, ⊤, n ≥ 2) match. But the generator set is incorrectly specified via a dubious cast, which is a substantive mismatch. No vacuous placeholders are used, but the core generator specification is wrong. Hence not faithful, but close in intent.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Subgroup` set up the environment.
- The docstring states: If a group G has elements a, b with a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1 and ba = a^2 b, then the subgroup generated by a and b is isomorphic to Multiplicative (ZMod 2) (i.e., a cyclic group of order 2).
- The theorem `srdoty_alg_present_315` is parametrized by an arbitrary group `G` and elements `a b : G`, with hypotheses `ha : a ^ 5 = 1`, `hb : b ^ 2 = 1`, and `hrel : b * a = a ^ 2 * b`.
- The conclusion states a group isomorphism `(Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G) : Type) ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)`. In words: the subgroup of G generated by a and b is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2.

Assessment relative to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Show that the group given by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to ℤ₂.” This is about the abstract group defined by generators and relations (a presented group), which is a specific quotient of a free group.
- The Lean theorem does not define or refer to the group presented by those relations. Instead, it asserts that in any group G with elements a, b satisfying these relations, the subgroup they generate is isomorphic to Z₂. This is a much stronger universal statement and is in fact false: for example, in the trivial group, choosing a = b = 1 satisfies all relations, but the generated subgroup is trivial, not Z₂.
- Thus, the Lean theorem is not a faithful translation of the original statement. The correct formalization would define the presented group (as a quotient of the free group on two generators by the normal closure of the relations) and prove that specific group is isomorphic to ZMod 2, or equivalently show its universal property implies any realization is a quotient of Z₂ (hence at most Z₂), not necessarily equal to Z₂.

Final check:
- Original: “The group given by the presentation … is isomorphic to ℤ₂.”
- Lean: “For any group G and elements a, b satisfying the relations, the subgroup generated by a and b is isomorphic to ℤ₂.”
- These are different. The Lean statement is strictly stronger and incorrect; it does not faithfully encode the claim about the presented group.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions were introduced, but the main statement does not match the natural language statement and is in fact false in general. This is a significant mismatch, therefore a low grade.

3) Final check: The natural language problem concerns normality of SL(n) in GL(n) and an isomorphism of the quotient with the multiplicative group of nonzero reals via the determinant homomorphism. The (absent) code cannot possibly match this. Hence, the two are different in the strongest possible sense: one exists, the other does not.

Given the strict guidelines, the absence of code means the translation fails outright.

  Natural language: Let H be a subgroup of G with finite cardinality n (h_card). Assume H is the unique subgroup of G of order n, meaning any subgroup K of G with |K| = n must equal H (h_unique). Then for every g in G, the image of H under the conjugation automorphism by g, i.e., gHg⁻¹, equals H. In other words, H is invariant under conjugation by any element of G.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: If H is a subgroup of order n in G and H is the only subgroup of order n, then H is normal in G.
- Lean: Exactly formalizes “H has order n” via [Fintype H] and h_card, formalizes “unique subgroup of order n” via h_unique, and concludes “H is normal” via equality Subgroup.map ((MulAut.conj g).toMulHom) H = H for all g, which is a standard characterization of normality. This is logically equivalent to H ▹ G.

3) Final check for differences:
- Conclusion phrased as conjugation invariance rather than Subgroup.Normal H; these are equivalent in Mathlib.
- Minor technical note: the uniqueness hypothesis is stated as ∀ K : Subgroup G, Fintype.card K = n → K = H. In Lean this typically requires [Fintype K] to state Fintype.card K. While the prompt asserts the code compiles, mathematically this is exactly the intended uniqueness among subgroups of order n. No vacuous/placeholder definitions are used. The overall mathematical content matches perfectly.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

This matches applying the 2×2 matrix [[cos θ, −sin θ],[sin θ, cos θ]] to the vector (x,y). It does not introduce an explicit matrix Rθ, but the formula coincides with Rθ acting on vectors.
- theorem rho_apply_formula ... := by sorry: States the explicit component formula for ρ; essentially restates the definition.
- theorem rho_preserves_squared_norm ... := by sorry: States that the squared Euclidean norm is preserved: |ρ θ (x,y)|^2 = |(x,y)|^2. The docstring claims this means it is an isometry fixing the origin, but the theorem itself only asserts norm preservation for each input; it does not assert linearity or isometry as a structure. Still, the preservation statement is correct for rotations.
- theorem rho_dot_product ... := by sorry: States that the dot product ⟨(x,y), ρ θ (x,y)⟩ equals cos θ times |(x,y)|^2. This is a characteristic relation satisfied by rotation by angle θ, assuming also norm preservation, but it alone does not uniquely specify the rotation direction (+θ vs −θ), nor does it claim any global structural property (linearity, orientation-preserving, determinant 1, etc.).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
The original statement: Define ρ θ(X) = R θ X with the standard rotation matrix R θ, and show that ρ θ is a rotation through θ radians; i.e., for any X, ρ θ(X) is obtained by rotating X by angle θ about the origin.

What the code does:
- It defines ρ θ via the correct coordinate formula (equivalent to applying R θ). That part matches the setup.
- It then states three lemmas: the definitional formula, preservation of the squared norm, and the self-dot-product identity. These are properties consistent with rotations.

What is missing:
- There is no formal statement that “ρ θ is a rotation through angle θ about the origin.” Mathlib has notions to formalize this (e.g., expressing ρ θ as a linear isometry of ℝ² with determinant 1, or as an element of the special orthogonal group SO(2), or identifying it with a rotation by θ in the plane). None of these are stated.
- The presented lemmas are weaker than the intended claim. In particular, the dot product identity does not distinguish between +θ and −θ (cosine is even). The code does not assert orientation preservation, determinant 1, linearity, or angle/argument shift explicitly.
- The promised matrix R θ is not defined as a matrix object, though the function matches its action; that alone is acceptable, but the final “Show that ρ θ is a rotation through θ” is not encoded as a theorem.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The code sets up ρ θ and lists some characteristic properties, but it never states or proves a theorem that ρ θ is the rotation of ℝ² through angle θ about the origin. The essential claim (that ρ θ is exactly the rotation by θ) is not formalized. Even if the provided lemmas were proved, they do not suffice to express the precise “i.e.” clause in the natural language statement. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholder definitions are made; the function is legitimately defined. However, the main statement is missing and is only partially approximated by weaker lemmas. Hence a low, but not minimal, score.

It sets u = (cos θ, sin θ) and defines H_θ = 2 u uᵀ − I, with entries H_θ(i,j) = 2 u_i u_j − δ_ij. This is the standard Householder reflection across the one-dimensional subspace spanned by u, i.e., the line at angle θ.

The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement precisely asserts the desired classification of O(2).

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement says O(2) = {R_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} ∪ {H_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}, with R_θ the standard rotation matrix and H_θ the reflection across the line at angle θ. The Lean statement defines R_θ and H_θ exactly in these terms and asserts {M | M Mᵀ = 1} = range R ∪ range H. This is precisely the same set equality. Using {M | M Mᵀ = 1} to define O(2) is standard and faithful.

3) Final check for differences and red flags:
- Auxiliary definitions are concrete and correct (not vacuous). R and H match the intended matrices.
- Using Set.range is the correct way to formalize {R_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} and {H_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}.
- The characterization of O(2) as {M | M Mᵀ = 1} is standard. No missing conditions.
- While Mathlib has OrthogonalGroup, using the set {M | M Mᵀ = 1} is still faithful.
- No secondary vacuous placeholders. The theorem statement matches the natural language claim exactly.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- def O_n : Type := {A // is_orthogonal n A}: defines O(n) as a subtype of matrices satisfying orthogonality. It is just a type, not endowed with a group structure. Acceptable as a set-level definition.
- def SO_n : Type := {A // is_orthogonal n A ∧ det A = 1}: defines SO(n) as those orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. Also just a subtype of matrices, not a subgroup of O_n.
- lemma orthogonal_conj_preserves_det ... : det (A * B * Aᵀ) = det B: states determinant is preserved under conjugation by an orthogonal A. It unnecessarily assumes B is orthogonal, but the intended statement (det invariant under conjugation) is fine in spirit. Proof omitted with sorry, but the statement itself is meaningful.
- lemma SO_normal : ∀ A ∈ O_n, ∀ B ∈ SO_n, is_orthogonal (A B Aᵀ) ∧ det (A B Aᵀ) = 1: states that conjugating an element of SO(n) by an element of O(n) remains orthogonal and keeps determinant 1. This captures the set-level closure under conjugation, which is the essential property for normality, but the code does not provide group structures or a NormalSubgroup relationship; it just gives a property on matrices. It does not show that SO_n is a subgroup of O_n in any formal sense, nor that it is normal in the group-theoretic sense. So it falls short of formally stating “SO(n) ◁ O(n)”.
- lemma O_quot_SO_equiv_units_int : True: this is a vacuous placeholder. It does not state any isomorphism of a quotient to the unit group of ℤ. Moreover, there is no quotient group defined on O_n/SO_n in the development (no group structure on O_n, no subgroup SO_n, no quotient), so the essential second claim is entirely missing.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language states two things: (i) SO(n) is a normal subgroup of O(n), and (ii) O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ×. The code only provides a set-level conjugation-closure lemma for SO(n) within matrices, not a formal normal subgroup statement within the group O(n). It neither builds nor uses the group structure on O(n) or SO(n). Mathlib has OrthogonalGroup and SpecialOrthogonalGroup with group structures and a normal subgroup structure; none of that is used. Thus the first part is not formally stated as “SO(n) ◁ O(n)”.
- The second part is entirely missing: the lemma is replaced by “True”, a vacuous statement. This blatantly fails to translate the claim that O(n)/SO(n) is isomorphic to ℤ×.

3) Final check — same or different?
- Different. The code does not assert normality in the group-theoretic sense and completely omits the quotient isomorphism, replacing it by True. Additionally, it avoids using Mathlib’s standard group constructions (OrthogonalGroup, SpecialOrthogonalGroup, quotient groups), which is a red flag per the guideline about using applicable Mathlib terms.

- States a theorem: for any group G, natural number n, field F, and a function δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n) (i.e., a map from G to the symmetric group S_n on n elements), there exists a map ρ : G → (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F)ˣ (i.e., into the group of units of n×n matrices over F, which is GL_n(F)) such that:
  • For all g, the underlying matrix of ρ g is given entrywise by (i, j) ↦ if i = δ g j then 1 else 0 (i.e., the permutation matrix attached to δ g under the convention P_{i,j} = 1 iff i = δ(g)(j)).
  • For all g h in G, ρ(g*h) = ρ g * ρ h (so ρ is multiplicative, i.e., a representation).

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Let G be a group, n ∈ ℕ, F a field. Show that any permutation representation δ: G → S_n gives rise to a matrix representation ρ: G → GL_n(F) by sending g to the permutation matrix P_{δ(g)}.
- Key meaning: δ should be a group homomorphism (the phrase “permutation representation” means a group hom G → S_n). Then define ρ(g) to be the corresponding permutation matrix, and ρ is a group homomorphism into GL_n(F).

3) Differences and final check:
- Critical mismatch: In the Lean theorem, δ is merely an arbitrary function δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n); it is not assumed to be a group homomorphism. The conclusion, however, asserts the existence of ρ that is multiplicative and whose underlying matrices are exactly the permutation matrices of δ(g). This implicitly forces δ to be a homomorphism (since P_{δ(gh)} = P_{δ(g)} P_{δ(h)} implies δ(gh) = δ(g) ∘ δ(h)), but the Lean statement omits the needed hypothesis and thus claims a stronger statement than the NL one. Hence the formal statement is not the same as the intended one.
- Target GL_n(F): The Lean code uses (Matrix ...)ˣ, which is definitionally GL_n(F) in Mathlib, so that part is fine.
- The explicit entrywise definition of permutation matrices matches a standard convention; no issue there.
- Existence vs construction: The NL statement’s ""gives rise"" is compatible with an existential claim, so that part is fine.

Conclusion: The missing assumption that δ is a group homomorphism means the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement. Everything else aligns, but this is a crucial mismatch.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Real`: Import Mathlib and open the Real namespace (though the latter isn't strictly necessary to use `sin` and `cos`).
- Comment explains the goal: addition formulas for sine and cosine.
- `theorem sin_cos_add (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : ... := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem with variables θ1, θ2 ∈ ℝ and states a conjunction of two identities:
  • `cos (θ1 + θ2) = cos θ1 * cos θ2 - sin θ1 * sin θ2`
  • `sin (θ1 + θ2) = sin θ1 * cos θ2 + cos θ1 * sin θ2`
  The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for a translation check; it still compiles in Lean.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The natural language statement asks for a proof of the sine and cosine addition formulas, explicitly spelling out the two identities for all real θ1, θ2. The Lean statement asserts exactly those two identities, universally quantified over θ1, θ2 ∈ ℝ, packaged as a conjunction. This matches the mathematical content of the original statement. While the phrase ""Give a conceptual derivation"" emphasizes the nature of the proof, our task is to check the fidelity of the statement, not the presence or style of a proof. Thus, the Lean theorem statement faithfully translates the requested identities.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Quantification: Both are universal over θ1, θ2 ∈ ℝ. Match.
- Content: Both identities are exactly the standard addition formulas as stated. Match.
- Packaging: The Lean code combines them with ∧, matching the two separate displayed equalities. Equivalent.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions. None present.
- Using standard Mathlib functions `sin` and `cos`. Correct.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the mathematical statement. The lack of a proof is acceptable for this audit, as we only check the statement’s fidelity.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `theorem srdoty_alg_linear_gps_373 {n : Nat} (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)` introduces an n×n real matrix A indexed by Fin n for rows and columns.
- Hypothesis `(h : A.transpose * A = (1 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ))` states that Aᵀ A = I, i.e., A is an orthogonal matrix in the sense of the defining equation for O(n).
- Conclusion `∀ i j : Fin n, (∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j) = (if i = j then (1 : ℝ) else 0)` states that for all indices i, j, the sum over k of A_{k,i} A_{k,j} equals 1 if i = j, and 0 otherwise. This is exactly the (i,j) entry of Aᵀ A equaling δ_{ij}.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: Let A ∈ O(n) (orthogonal group over ℝ) with columns A₁, …, Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ. Show Aᵀ_i A_j = δ_{ij} for all i, j. Equivalently, the columns are orthonormal, i.e., the (i,j) entry of Aᵀ A equals δ_{ij}. The Lean hypothesis Aᵀ A = I captures A ∈ O(n) (by definition for matrices over ℝ), and the conclusion expands the (i,j) entry equality into the summation form, which equals the dot product of the i-th and j-th columns. Hence it is a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code uses the defining condition Aᵀ A = I rather than a dedicated OrthogonalGroup type. This is mathematically equivalent and faithful to “A ∈ O(n)”.
- The conclusion uses the coordinate summation form instead of vector-dot notation A_iᵀ A_j, but they are the same: (Aᵀ A)_{ij} = ∑_k A_{k,i} A_{k,j} = δ_{ij}.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is unproved (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing task focused on translation.
No mismatches found.

  Meaning: Let A be a real n×n matrix indexed by Fin n. Assume Aᵀ A = I (the identity matrix). Then for all indices i, j, the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. The expression ∑ k A k i * A k j is exactly the standard dot product of the i-th and j-th columns of A.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: A ∈ O(n) with columns A_1, …, A_n ∈ ℝ^n, show A_i · A_j = δ_{ij}. In ℝ, A ∈ O(n) means Aᵀ A = I. The Lean hypothesis h : A.transpose * A = 1 expresses precisely that.
- The conclusion expresses that the dot product of the i-th and j-th columns equals the Kronecker delta: the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. This is exactly A_i · A_j = δ_{ij}.
- Indexing via Fin n (0,…,n−1) is a standard Lean convention and is equivalent to 1,…,n in content.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same: The Lean statement precisely captures the orthogonality of columns of an orthogonal matrix over ℝ, i.e., A_i · A_j = δ_{ij}. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of Aᵀ A = I matches A ∈ O(n). The target equality is exactly the Kronecker delta condition. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This states that for every θ ∈ R, the map ρ_θ sends the origin (0,0) to itself.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
Yes. The natural language says: for every θ ∈ R, the rotation operator ρ_θ: R^2 → R^2 defined by ρ_θ(X) = R_θ X fixes the origin. The code defines ρ_θ exactly as the standard rotation by θ on R^2 (encoded as R × R) and asserts that ρ_θ maps (0,0) to (0,0). This is precisely “fixes the origin.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Using ℝ × ℝ instead of a dedicated ℝ^2 type is a standard and faithful identification in Mathlib.
- ρ_θ is defined explicitly by the rotation matrix entries rather than as a linear map or matrix multiplication; this is still a faithful definition of the same operator for the purpose of the stated property.

- def G'_subtype := { M : M22 // is_form M ∧ M ≠ zero_mat }: Packages G' as a subtype with proofs of form and non-zeroness. Equivalent to the set G'.
- noncomputable def G'_group : Group G'_subtype := by sorry: Asserts a group structure on G'_subtype, but supplies it via sorry. Also, no multiplication, identity, or inverse operations are defined on M22 or on the subtype. Hence, this is a vacuous placeholder.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Natural language: Let G = {[[a, -b],[b, a]] : a,b ∈ ℝ} and G' = G \ {0}. Prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The code correctly models the set G and G' (as a subtype) in their custom M22 type.
- However, the crucial part “under matrix multiplication” is not formalized. There is no definition of matrix multiplication on M22, no One, no Inv, no closure proof, etc.
- The final line merely asserts a Group structure by sorry, without tying it to matrix multiplication. Even if a Group structure were provided, it could be arbitrary unless it is explicitly the restriction of matrix multiplication; the code does not state or enforce this.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The code does not define matrix multiplication at all. The original statement is about being a group under matrix multiplication.
  - The group structure is asserted via sorry and is not linked to the intended operation.
  - The code uses a custom matrix type rather than Mathlib’s Matrix, which is acceptable only if operations are faithfully defined, but they are not.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Other red flags per guidelines:
- Heavy reliance on a vacuous sorry for the main claim. No supporting structure (Mul/One/Inv) is defined.
- Does not use Mathlib’s standard Matrix machinery, and does not reconstruct it properly.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the missing definitions (matrix multiplication, identity, inverse; and a proper Group instance induced by these) were supplied, the final goal could be faithful. As is, it fails.

- Natural language: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c ∈ ℤ. Prove the properties: a ≡ a (mod n); if a ≡ b (mod n) then b ≡ a (mod n); if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n) then a ≡ c (mod n).
- The Lean theorem exactly states these three properties as a conjunction, with the correct domain (integers) and the positivity assumption on n. The notation `[ZMOD n]` is standard Mathlib for integer congruence modulo n.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Quantification: The NL statement has a fixed positive integer n; the Lean theorem universally quantifies over n with a positivity hypothesis `0 < n`. This matches the intent.
- Domain: integers throughout, as required.
- Content: The three properties are exactly reflexive, symmetric (conditional), and transitive (conditional) for congruence modulo n.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; uses standard Mathlib constructs.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := ...` defines the standard rotation of the plane by angle θ as a function on R × R: (x, y) ↦ (cos θ x − sin θ y, sin θ x + cos θ y).
- `theorem rho_comp (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : (rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2) = rho (θ1 + θ2)` states that composing rotations adds their angles: ρ_{θ1} ∘ ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2}.
- `theorem rho_inverse (θ : ℝ) : (rho θ) ∘ (rho (-θ)) = _root_.id` states that composing rotation by θ with rotation by −θ (in that order) is the identity function. This asserts that ρ_{−θ} is a right-inverse of ρ_θ but does not assert it is the two-sided inverse nor does it use an inverse operator.
- `theorem rho_comm (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : (rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2) = (rho θ2) ∘ (rho θ1)` states that rotations commute under composition.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The first part “for all θ1, θ2, ρ_{θ1} ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2}” matches `rho_comp` exactly (with composition interpreted as function composition).
- The second part “(ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{-θ}” is stronger than what `rho_inverse` states. The code only proves one composition equals the identity, i.e., (ρ_θ) ∘ (ρ_{−θ}) = id. This is only a right-inverse statement, whereas the natural language statement asserts equality to the inverse, which entails both left- and right-inverse (or an explicit inverse notion, e.g., as an Equiv/Homeomorph/LinearIsometry). The code does not assert (ρ_{−θ}) ∘ (ρ_θ) = id, nor does it express inverse equality as such.
- The “In particular, rotations commute” part is explicitly stated as `rho_comm`, matching the natural language conclusion.

Step 3: Final check of differences.
- Main discrepancy: the inverse claim. The natural language states (ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{−θ}, but the code only gives a right-inverse equation. Without also having (ρ_{−θ}) ∘ (ρ_θ) = id or stating inverse equality in an appropriate structure (e.g., Equiv), the translation is not faithful to that part. Moreover, the code does not include or reference a lemma like `rho 0 = id` that, together with `rho_comp`, would imply the left-inverse equation.
- The other parts (composition adds angles, commutativity) are faithful.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to the inverse statement being weakened to a right-inverse only. Everything else aligns.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem statement introduces a function f : ℂ → ℂ.
- Hypothesis h_mul: ∀ z w, f (z + w) = f z * f w. This says f is multiplicative with respect to addition (Cauchy exponential equation form).
- Hypothesis h0: f 0 = 1.
- Conclusion: ∀ z, f z ≠ 0. That is, f never takes the value 0 anywhere on ℂ.

Assessment of alignment with the natural language statement:
- The natural language first gives a specific instance (the exponential function): use e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 to show e^z ≠ 0 for all z ∈ ℂ.
- It then explicitly generalizes: “In other words, show that if a function f satisfies f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z.”
- The Lean theorem exactly states this general version for any f : ℂ → ℂ with the two properties, concluding f z ≠ 0 for all z.

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.
- No vacuous definitions; the hypotheses are concrete equalities in ℂ.
- The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing since we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the “in other words” version of the natural language statement. It implies the specific exponential case as a corollary. There are no mismatches in quantification, domain (ℂ), or conditions. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- theorem H_eq (θ : ℝ) : H θ = H0 * R (-2 * θ) := by sorry: States that for each real θ, H_θ equals H₀ multiplied by R_{−2θ}. Proof omitted.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: For each θ ∈ ℝ, H_θ = H₀ R_{−2θ}, with H₀ = [[1,0],[0,−1]] and R_φ = [[cos φ, −sin φ], [sin φ, cos φ]].
- The Lean definitions of H₀ and R_φ match exactly the given matrices.
- The theorem states the exact equality H θ = H0 * R (−2 θ) for all θ, matching the statement.
- The explicit definition of H_θ in the code is consistent with H₀ R_{−2θ}: computing R(−2θ) = [[cos 2θ, sin 2θ], [−sin 2θ, cos 2θ]] and multiplying by H₀ on the left gives [[cos 2θ, sin 2θ], [sin 2θ, −cos 2θ]], exactly the defined H θ. Thus, the code’s H matches the intended relationship.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; all definitions are concrete. The proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
The Lean theorem precisely states the same equality for each θ as the natural language statement, with correctly defined matrices. There are no discrepancies in order of multiplication or signs. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in mathlib.
- `open Matrix` just opens the Matrix namespace; no mathematical content change.
- `noncomputable def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix indexed by `Fin 2`. The entrywise definition via `if`/`else if` sets:
  • (0,0) entry = cos θ,
  • (0,1) entry = −sin θ,
  • (1,0) entry = sin θ,
  • all other cases (which in 2×2 means (1,1)) = cos θ.
  So R(θ) = [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]].
- `theorem rotation_in_SO2 (θ : ℝ) : (R θ).transpose * R θ = 1 ∧ det (R θ) = 1 := ...` states for each real θ, the rotation matrix satisfies Aᵀ A = I and det A = 1. This is exactly the usual characterization of membership in SO(2): orthogonality (AᵀA = I) and special (det = 1).

2) Faithfulness to the NL statement:
- The natural language claim is: show R_θ ∈ SO(2) for every θ ∈ ℝ, where R_θ is the standard 2×2 rotation matrix. The code defines exactly that R_θ and asserts the two defining properties of SO(2): orthogonality and determinant 1. While it does not name `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` explicitly, the conjunction `(R θ).transpose * R θ = 1 ∧ det (R θ) = 1` is a standard and faithful reformulation of “R_θ ∈ SO(2)”. The quantification over all θ is captured by the theorem taking θ as an arbitrary parameter.

3) Final check and differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `R` is a concrete matrix.
- The statement matches the intended meaning: orthogonal with determinant 1 in 2×2 real matrices is precisely SO(2).
- The only stylistic difference is that it does not use the mathlib type `SpecialOrthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ`, but the proposition stated is logically equivalent to membership in SO(2). This is acceptable per the guidelines.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `/-- Polarization identity for complex numbers. -/`: Docstring.
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : Complex) : ... := by sorry`: States an equality in ℂ for arbitrary complex numbers z, w; proof omitted.
- Left-hand side: `4 * z * (Complex.re w - Complex.I * Complex.im w)` is a complex expression. Since `Complex.re w` and `Complex.im w` are real numbers, they coerce to complex numbers via `Complex.ofReal`. The term `(Complex.re w - Complex.I * Complex.im w)` equals `re w - i * im w`, which is exactly the complex conjugate of `w`, `conj w`. So the LHS is `4 z conj w`.
- Right-hand side: `(Complex.ofReal (Complex.normSq (z + w)) - Complex.ofReal (Complex.normSq (z - w))) + Complex.I * (Complex.ofReal (Complex.normSq (z + Complex.I * w)) - Complex.ofReal (Complex.normSq (z - Complex.I * w)))`. Here `Complex.normSq u` is the real number |u|^2 (the squared modulus), and `Complex.ofReal` embeds it into ℂ. Thus this is `(|z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2) + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2)` as a complex number.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- The natural language statement: 4 z \bar{w} = |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2).
- The Lean statement says precisely that, with `\bar{w}` rendered as `re w - i im w` and |·|^2 rendered as `Complex.normSq`, cast to ℂ via `Complex.ofReal`.

3) Final check for differences:
- No change in meaning. The use of `Complex.normSq` and `Complex.ofReal` is the standard way to express squared modulus as a complex number. The conjugate is expressed via `re` and `im` in a definitionally equivalent way. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is faithful.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the polarization identity.

This asserts the existence of a bijection between S_n and the set of invertible matrices that are permutation matrices (viewed as a subtype of Units), such that the underlying function is multiplicative.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The natural statement: S_n is isomorphic to the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL_n(F) via the specific map α ↦ P_α, where P_α is obtained by permuting the columns of the identity.
- The code captures: (i) what a permutation matrix is (via is_perm_matrix), (ii) GL_n(F) as Units of the matrix ring, and (iii) existence of some multiplicative bijection (an Equiv that preserves multiplication) between S_n and the subtype of Units consisting of permutation matrices.
- However, the theorem only asserts the existence of some equivalence e with multiplicativity, not that e is the specific map σ ↦ the unit associated to perm_matrix σ. Although perm_matrix is defined, it is not used in the theorem statement, and no condition ties e to that explicit construction. Thus, the code does not state “via the map α ↦ P_α,” but merely “there exists an isomorphism.” There can be many group isomorphisms (e.g., conjugates) between S_n and its image in GL_n(F), so existence alone is strictly weaker than the required explicit identification.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - The original statement specifies the isomorphism explicitly by α ↦ P_α (columns-σ permutation). The Lean theorem merely asserts existence of an Equiv with multiplicativity, without identifying it as σ ↦ perm_matrix σ.
  - The code uses Equiv plus a separate multiplicativity property rather than a MulEquiv; that is fine logically, but it underscores the lack of explicit identification with perm_matrix.
  - The subgroup is represented as a subtype of Units with is_perm_matrix; that aligns with the intended subgroup.
- Conclusion: The translation is very close but not faithful, because it does not assert the specific map α ↦ P_α; it only claims existence of some multiplicative bijection.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions: perm_matrix and is_perm_matrix are substantive and correct. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is fine for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- NL: |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U — Lean encodes this as existence of a ball around z0 contained in U on which `‖f z‖ ≤ ‖f z0‖`. This correctly formalizes “local maximum at z0”.
- NL: Then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0 — Lean concludes existence of a positive-radius ball contained in U where `f` equals `f z0`, i.e., constant on a neighborhood. This matches precisely.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain of f: NL uses `f : U → ℂ`; Lean uses `f : ℂ → ℂ` with `DifferentiableOn` on U. This is standard and equivalent for the purpose here. No loss of meaning.
- The neighborhood is expressed as an open metric ball; this is an acceptable neighborhood in ℂ and faithful to the statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is a single theorem with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Import Mathlib: we use Mathlib's group-theoretic notions (Subgroup, index, closure).

- Theorem `subgroup_generated_by_index_two`:
  Statement: Let G be a group, H a subgroup, and a ∈ G. If the index of H in G is 2 and a ∉ H, then the subgroup generated by H together with a equals the whole group G. Formally: Subgroup.closure (H ∪ {a}) = ⊤. The code uses `H.toSubmonoid.carrier` to represent the underlying set of H (a harmless stylistic choice).
  This is the standard abstract lemma: an index-2 subgroup together with any element outside it generates the whole group.

- Theorem `O2_generated_by_SO2_and_A`:
  Statement: In an arbitrary group G, given subgroups O2 and SO2 with SO2 of index 2, and an element A ∈ G with A ∈ O2 and A ∉ SO2, then the subgroup generated by SO2 ∪ {A} is the whole group G: Subgroup.closure (SO2 ∪ {A}) = ⊤. The comments say this captures the O(2)/SO(2) situation once one identifies G with O(2), SO2 with the rotation subgroup, and uses that the index is 2.
  Note: The parameter O2 is unused in the conclusion (and not needed for the abstract assertion). The key hypotheses used for the conclusion are just that SO2 has index 2 in G and A ∉ SO2.

Original natural language: For the concrete group O(2) (2×2 real orthogonal matrices) with SO(2) the rotations, for any improper orthogonal matrix A (i.e., A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2)), O(2) is generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}.

- The first theorem is an abstract group-theoretic lemma that exactly underlies the concrete fact: if H has index 2 in G, then H together with any element outside H generates G.
- The second theorem packages this in an abstract form that one can instantiate by taking G = O(2) and SO2 = the rotation subgroup, together with the (known) fact that SO(2) has index 2 in O(2), and A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2). Under that instantiation, the conclusion Subgroup.closure (SO2 ∪ {A}) = ⊤ is exactly “the subgroup generated equals the whole group O(2).” The “improper orthogonal” condition is precisely A ∉ SO(2) in that context.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code does not define O(2), SO(2), or matrices; it states the abstract lemma and an abstract corollary requiring the index-2 hypothesis. This is acceptable as a faithful translation because the mathematical content is exactly the same upon instantiation with G = O(2) and the known property [SO(2) has index 2 in O(2)].
- Minor mismatch: the second theorem includes an extra parameter O2 and a hypothesis A ∈ O2 which are unused in the conclusion. The conclusion is stated as equality to ⊤ rather than to O2, but when we take G = O(2), ⊤ is O(2). This is a benign redundancy and does not change the meaning when specialized to the intended case.
- The code assumes the index-2 property as a hypothesis rather than proving it. Since the original statement is specific to O(2), where this property holds, this is a standard reduction and does not alter the content of the claim.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful abstract translation of the statement, with a small redundancy (unused O2) and relying on the known index-2 fact as a hypothesis. No vacuous placeholders; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. Hence it passes, with a small deduction for the slightly awkward second theorem signature.

  Interprets a vector (x, y) in R^2 as the complex number x + i y.

- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ -> ℝ × ℝ := fun ⟨x, y⟩ => (x * Real.cos θ - y * Real.sin θ, x * Real.sin θ + y * Real.cos θ)`
  Defines ρ_θ as the usual rotation matrix action on R^2.

- `theorem angle_between_rho_eq ... : (toComplex (rho θ X)).arg = (toComplex X).arg + θ`
  Under assumptions: (i) X ≠ 0 (as a complex number), (ii) θ lies in the principal branch interval (-π, π], and (iii) the sum arg(X) + θ also lies in (-π, π], it concludes that the (principal value) argument of the rotated vector equals arg(X) + θ exactly. This is a statement about Complex.arg with explicit branch restrictions.

2) Faithfulness assessment to the original statement:
Original claim: For any real θ and any nonzero X ∈ R^2, the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ (hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ).

Differences:
- Scope of θ: The Lean statement assumes θ ∈ (-π, π], while the natural language statement says for any θ ∈ ℝ.
- Additional hypothesis: The Lean theorem also assumes arg(X) + θ ∈ (-π, π]. The original statement has no such restriction.
- Nature of angle: The Lean theorem speaks about equality of principal arguments, which forces exact equality rather than equality modulo 2π. The natural language “angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ” is most naturally an oriented angle statement defined modulo 2π (or at least requires a convention) and should hold for all θ without branch conditions.
- The “hence rotation by θ” part is not expressed or concluded in the Lean code; only a specific arg equality under branch conditions is stated.

Thus, the Lean theorem is a strictly narrower, branch-specific statement about principal arguments, not the general statement for all θ and all nonzero X.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The Lean code imposes principal branch restrictions on θ and on arg(X)+θ, and states an exact equality of principal arguments. The original statement requires a global, branch-independent rotation-angle property for all θ, with no such restrictions, and frames it as an angle between vectors (oriented) equaling θ. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `abbrev M := Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) Real` and `abbrev GL2 := Units M` set up the ambient group as the group of invertible 2×2 real matrices (units of the 2×2 real matrix ring). This matches GL(2, R).
- `def G_set : Set GL2 := { U | ((U : M) (1 : Fin 2) (0 : Fin 2) = 0) }` defines the set of invertible 2×2 real matrices whose bottom-left entry is 0 (i.e., upper-triangular in 2×2 case). This faithfully captures the intended set, interpreted inside GL2.
- `def N_set : Set GL2 := { U | ((U : M) (1 : Fin 2) (0 : Fin 2) = 0) ∧ ((U : M) (0 : Fin 2) (0 : Fin 2) = 1) ∧ ((U : M) (1 : Fin 2) (1 : Fin 2) = 1) }` defines the set of invertible matrices of the form [[1, b], [0, 1]]. This is faithful.
- `def G : Subgroup GL2 := by sorry` is supposed to define the subgroup G, but it is a vacuous placeholder: it neither references `G_set` nor constructs a subgroup. This is a red flag per the guidelines.
- `def N : Subgroup GL2 := by sorry` similarly is a vacuous placeholder and does not guarantee it matches `N_set`.
- `def N_normal_in_G : ∀ (g : GL2) (hg : g ∈ (G : Set GL2)) (n : GL2) (hn : n ∈ (N : Set GL2)), (g * n * g⁻¹) ∈ (N : Set GL2) := by sorry` is intended to express that N is normal in G via conjugation invariance. However, it is given as a `def` with a `sorry` body (vacuous). Moreover, it does not assert the inclusion `N ≤ G`, which is part of the meaning of “N ◁ G”. Even if one accepts the conjugation invariance as the right notion, the proof is omitted.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement asks to show that G (upper-triangular real 2×2 matrices) is a subgroup of GL(2). Interpreting G as those upper-triangular matrices that are invertible, this is what the code intends to capture in `G_set`. But the actual subgroup object `G` is not defined (left as `sorry`) and not tied to `G_set`, so the translation fails at the critical point of constructing the subgroup.
- The NL statement defines N = {[[1, b], [0, 1]]} and asks to prove N ◁ G (both that N is a subgroup and that it is normal in G). The code has a faithful set predicate `N_set` but then leaves `N : Subgroup GL2` as `sorry` and the normality statement as a `sorry`. Furthermore, the normality statement does not include the inclusion `N ≤ G`, which is part of “N normal in G”.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- The intended sets `G_set` and `N_set` do match the mathematical description when viewed as subsets of GL2.
- However, the crucial subgroup constructions `G` and `N` are not provided, and the normality statement is both vacuous (sorry) and incomplete (missing `N ≤ G`).
- Because of these vacuities, the code does not faithfully translate the NL statement.

Conclusion: The translation fails due to vacuous placeholders for the key subgroup definitions and the normality proof, and a missing inclusion condition for normality.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem schwarz_lemma {f : ℂ → ℂ}`: We consider a complex-valued function on the whole complex plane.
- `(h_maps : ∀ (z : ℂ), Complex.abs z < (1 : ℝ) → Complex.abs (f z) < (1 : ℝ))`: Assumption that for every z with |z| < 1 (i.e., z in the open unit disk 𝔻), we have |f z| < 1. This encodes that f maps the unit disk into itself.
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)`: Assumption f(0) = 0.
- `(h_diff : DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0)`: Assumption that f is complex differentiable at 0 only.
- Conclusion: `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ (1 : ℝ)`: |f'(0)| ≤ 1.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Suppose f: 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1.”
- Mapping 𝔻 → 𝔻: The Lean hypothesis `h_maps` faithfully encodes that f maps the open unit disk into itself (using |z|<1 ⇒ |f z|<1). That part matches.
- f(0)=0: `h0` matches exactly.
- Holomorphic: The NL statement requires that f is holomorphic on the unit disk (i.e., complex differentiable on an open neighborhood of each point in 𝔻). The Lean code only assumes `DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0`, i.e., differentiable at 0, with no assumption of being holomorphic (differentiable) on the whole disk (or even on a neighborhood of 0 beyond the single point). This is a strictly weaker hypothesis and does not faithfully capture “f is holomorphic on 𝔻.” In Mathlib terms, one would expect something like `DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1)` (or `AnalyticOn`), not merely `DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0`.
- Domain: The Lean function is defined on ℂ rather than just 𝔻, which is acceptable as a modeling choice, provided the holomorphic-on-𝔻 requirement is included; however, that key requirement is missing.

Final check (same or different?): They are different. The Lean code claims the Schwarz lemma conclusion under weaker assumptions (only differentiability at 0) than the natural language statement (holomorphic on the unit disk). This is a substantive mismatch of hypotheses and thus not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale: The mapping condition and the value at 0 are captured correctly, and the conclusion matches. However, the essential holomorphy-on-𝔻 assumption is missing, replaced by mere differentiability at 0. This is a significant difference. Hence not faithful; score 8 reflects that it’s close but misses a key hypothesis.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open PowerSeries; open Finset: Set up to use power series and finite sets/products.
- def support_series (k : ℕ) : PowerSeries ℤ := PowerSeries.mk (fun r => if k ∣ r then (1 : ℤ) else 0): For each k ≥ 1, define the power series whose coefficient of X^r is 1 exactly when k divides r, and 0 otherwise.

- theorem partition_generating_function (p : ℕ → ℤ) : ∀ n, p n = (PowerSeries.coeff ℤ n) (Finset.prod (Finset.Ico 1 (n + 1)) fun k => support_series k) := by sorry: For an arbitrary function p : ℕ → ℤ, assert that for every n, p(n) equals the coefficient of X^n in the finite product ∏_{k=1}^n support_series k. (No proof is provided.)

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Show that ∑_{n=0}^∞ p(n) x^n = ∏_{k=1}^∞ 1/(1 - x^k), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n.
- Issues:
  - The Lean theorem quantifies over an arbitrary p : ℕ → ℤ and asserts p(n) equals a specific coefficient for all n. That is not only unrelated to partitions, it is logically false unless p is defined to be that coefficient function. It should either define p to be that coefficient function, or assert an equality of power series. As written, it does neither.
  - There is no definition of p(n) as ""the number of partitions of n"". The statement does not even mention partitions; it simply ties an arbitrary p to coefficients.
  - The Lean statement uses a finite product ∏_{k=1}^n instead of the infinite product. While coefficient-wise one can reduce the infinite product’s nth coefficient to the finite product up to k = n, the code does not state the infinite product identity nor the equality of full power series. It only gives a coefficient equality against a finite product and even that is tied to an arbitrary p.
  - The comment claims ""we state that there is a function p"" but the theorem actually says ""for any p""; i.e., the quantification is wrong (∃ vs ∀), changing the mathematical content dramatically.

3) Final comparison: same or different?
- Different. The original asks for the generating function identity for the partition numbers p(n). The code:
  - Does not define p(n) as partition numbers.
  - Does not assert the infinite product identity; only a finite product coefficient comparison.
  - Quantifies over arbitrary p, which is incorrect and not faithful to the intended meaning.
- Although support_series corresponds to 1/(1 - X^k), the main statement is not a faithful translation.

Additional notes:
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; support_series is legitimate. However, the main theorem statement is fundamentally mis-specified (wrong quantification and missing the partition interpretation and infinite product equality).

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- Context: U : Set Complex, f : Complex → Complex.
- hU : IsOpen U means U is an open subset of ℂ.
- hhol : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U means f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- hder : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0 means the complex derivative f′(z) is nonzero at every z ∈ U.
- Goal: ∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V : Set Complex, IsOpen V ∧ z ∈ V ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y). This states: for every z in U, there exists an open set V in ℂ containing z such that f is injective on V.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: U ⊆ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic; f′(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U; conclude f is locally injective on U.
- The Lean hypotheses match: open U, f holomorphic on U, nonvanishing derivative on U.
- The Lean conclusion asserts local injectivity in the ambient ℂ: for each z ∈ U there exists an open V containing z such that f is injective on V. Although it does not explicitly require V ⊆ U, since U is open we can choose V ⊆ U; moreover, even if a V not contained in U is obtained, taking V ∩ U (open, contains z) preserves injectivity. Hence the Lean conclusion is equivalent to “f is locally injective on U.”
- The choice of DifferentiableOn ℂ for “holomorphic” is standard in Mathlib; deriv is the complex derivative. No fake or vacuous definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions at all.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain mismatch: original has f : U → ℂ, Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. This is a standard and faithful way to encode a function defined on an open subset; it does not change the mathematical content of the statement.
- Subset condition V ⊆ U not required in Lean: as argued, this is equivalent given U is open, so no substantive difference.
- Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:

  This states: For a complex function f, a point z0 in ℂ, and a complex number f', if f has complex derivative f' at z0 (the hypothesis `h : HasDerivAt f f' z0`), then f is conformal at z0 if and only if f' ≠ 0. The `(fun z : ℂ => f z)` is just f; no extra content there. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions, only standard Mathlib notions `HasDerivAt` and `ConformalAt`.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- NL: “Suppose f: ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.”
- Code: Assumes only that f is differentiable at z0 with derivative f' (`HasDerivAt f f' z0`), and concludes `ConformalAt f z0 ↔ f' ≠ 0`.
- The substantive equivalence (conformal at z0 iff derivative at z0 is nonzero) matches. The code phrases the derivative as an explicit witness `f'` with `HasDerivAt`, rather than using `deriv f z0` or the global “holomorphic” hypothesis. This is a standard and slightly more general local formulation: holomorphic implies differentiable everywhere, so the NL assumption is stronger than necessary. The code’s hypothesis ensures the derivative at z0 exists and equals f', which is exactly what is needed to speak of f'(z0). Hence the mathematical content at the point z0 is the same.

3) Final check for differences:
- Difference: The NL assumes “f is holomorphic” (global), while the code only assumes pointwise differentiability at z0. This is a weakening of hypotheses, not a change of the local equivalence being proved. Since the statement is purely local at z0, the global holomorphic assumption is extraneous to the equivalence. The code does not misrepresent the claim; it states a slightly stronger/local version.
- All terms are legitimate Mathlib concepts; no placeholders or vacuous definitions. No extraneous auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful in mathematical meaning, with only a minor benign difference (weaker assumption). Given the instruction to be harsh, I note the missing “holomorphic” assumption, but it is not essential to the equivalence at a point, so the translation remains faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:

- The Lean statement exactly matches this: same domain (z : ℂ), same hypothesis (|z| < 1), same conclusion. The use of the principal branch of log in Lean is appropriate here since for |z| < 1, 1 − z lies in the open disk centered at 1 of radius 1, which avoids the branch cut (−∞, 0], so the principal log coincides with the standard analytic branch used in such inequalities.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement stands alone.

This states: Let U be a subset of the complex plane ℂ, assume U is open. Let f : ℂ → ℂ be a function that is complex-differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U). Then f is analytic on U, i.e., around every point of U there is a power series that converges on some neighborhood and sums to f on that neighborhood. No auxiliary definitions are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib notions `DifferentiableOn ℂ` and `AnalyticOn ℂ`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f is holomorphic on a domain U ⊆ ℂ (domain usually means open and connected), then f is analytic. Moreover, for each z₀ ∈ U, f has a Taylor series that converges in the disk {|z − z₀| < R}, where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum of the series equals f.
- The Lean statement captures: “holomorphic on an open set implies analytic,” which matches the first sentence in content (and even weakens the hypothesis by not requiring connectedness). It also implicitly covers “the sum equals f locally” since `AnalyticOn` means representable by a convergent power series on a neighborhood.
- However, the Lean statement does not capture the stronger and more specific claim: the radius of convergence is exactly the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞). `AnalyticOn` ensures the existence of some positive radius but says nothing about maximal radius nor identifying it with the distance to the nearest singularity. The code also does not mention singularities at all.
- Minor discrepancy: the natural language assumes a “domain” (open and connected), while the Lean code only assumes “open.” This makes the Lean theorem strictly more general with respect to hypotheses, which is acceptable in some contexts, but here the main missing content is the radius-to-nearest-singularity characterization.

3) Final check:
- The core ""holomorphic ⇒ analytic"" part is captured.
- The crucial additional detail about the radius of convergence equalling the distance to the nearest singularity is missing.
- Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the full natural language statement.

Grade rationale: No vacuous or placeholder definitions; standard Mathlib notions are used. The main deficiency is omission of the singularity/radius characterization. Hence not faithful overall, but reasonably close to part of the claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_2718 (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) {z0 c : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) (hval : f z0 = c) (hder : HasDerivAt f (0 : ℂ) z0) : ...` 
  Interprets as: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open. Let f : ℂ → ℂ be holomorphic on U. Let z0 ∈ U and c ∈ ℂ with f(z0) = c and f'(z0) = 0.
- Conclusion is a disjunction:
  1) `(∀ z ∈ U, f z = c)` meaning f ≡ c on U, or
  2) `∃ m ≥ 1, ∃ V open with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ holomorphic on V with g(z0) ≠ 0, such that ∀ z ∈ V, f z - c = (z - z0)^m * g z.` 
  This is the standard local factorization at z0 of a zero of order m: f − c = (z − z0)^m g with g holomorphic and nonvanishing at z0, on some neighborhood V.
- There are no auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions; the only nontrivial content is the theorem statement (with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for this task).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original assumptions: U is a domain (open and connected) and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and not constant; pick z0 ∈ U with f(z0) = c and f'(z0) = 0.
- Original conclusion: Either f ≡ c on U, or else if z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, then there is a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points, counted with multiplicity.

Differences:
1) Domain vs open: The code assumes only that U is open, not connected. For the local result, connectedness is not needed, but the stated natural language hypothesis explicitly says ""domain"". This is a mild mismatch of hypotheses.
2) ""Not constant"" assumption: The natural language states f is not constant but then still gives an ""either constant or ..."" conclusion. The code omits the ""not constant"" hypothesis and states the disjunction unconditionally. While this doesn’t break logical correctness (the result is true with or without that hypothesis), it is not a verbatim translation of the given assumptions.
3) Crucial conclusion mismatch: The original statement’s nontrivial conclusion is about the cardinality (with multiplicity) of f^{-1}(c) ∩ V being exactly m. The Lean code instead states the local factorization f(z) − c = (z − z0)^m g(z) with g(z0) ≠ 0. Although the factorization is equivalent to “z0 is a zero of order m” and from it one can derive the counting statement, the code does not itself state the counting conclusion about the preimage being exactly m points (with multiplicities). The docstring claims the counting follows, but the theorem statement does not include it. Given the auditing requirement that the translation must match the original statement, this is a substantive mismatch.
4) Order bound: With the hypothesis f'(z0) = 0, the order m should be at least 2. The code asserts only m ≥ 1. This is weaker than what one could deduce and does not match the implicit bound in the phrase “zero of order m” under f'(z0)=0, though the original doesn’t explicitly restate m ≥ 2.
5) Function type: The code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U instead of f : U → ℂ. This is a standard Mathlib formulation and acceptable as a faithful encoding of “holomorphic on U”.
6) Neighborhood containment: The code requires V ⊆ U, which is natural and consistent with the intended meaning of “a neighborhood of z0” within the domain of holomorphy.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem asserts local factorization (existence of m,V,g with f−c=(z−z0)^m g) as the second branch, while the original statement’s second branch asserts a counting statement about the number of solutions of f(z)=c near z0, counted with multiplicities. The code does not state this counting conclusion. Also, the hypotheses differ (domain/connectedness and “not constant” are omitted). Hence the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions or placeholders; the theorem is meaningful. However, the central conclusion in the natural language (count of preimages with multiplicity) is not present in the Lean statement; it is replaced by a related but different factorization statement. There are also hypothesis mismatches (domain vs open, omission of “not constant”). This is more than a minor discrepancy, so it cannot be considered “almost the same.” A mid-to-upper score below 9 is appropriate. I assign 7.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_5157 (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U)` declares an open set U in ℂ.
- `(psi : ℂ → ℝ → ℂ)` declares a function ψ taking (z, t) ∈ ℂ × ℝ to ℂ.
- `(h_cont : ContinuousOn (fun p : ℂ × ℝ => psi p.1 p.2) (U ×ˢ (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)))` asserts that the function (z, t) ↦ ψ(z, t) is continuous on U × [0, 1].
- `(h_diff : ∀ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => psi z t) U)` asserts that for each fixed t ∈ [0,1], the map z ↦ ψ(z, t) is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ∫ t in 0..1, psi z t) U` states that the function h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z, t) dt is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL assumptions: U ⊆ ℂ is open, ψ : U × [0,1] → ℂ is continuous, and for each t ∈ [0,1], z ↦ ψ(z, t) is holomorphic on U. Lean matches these via `IsOpen U`, `ContinuousOn ... (U ×ˢ Icc 0 1)`, and `DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => psi z t) U` for each t.
- NL conclusion: h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z, t) dt is holomorphic on U. Lean conclusion matches exactly as a `DifferentiableOn ℂ` statement on U.

Potential discrepancies checked:
- Domain of ψ: NL has ψ defined only on U × [0,1]; Lean allows ψ on ℂ × ℝ but only assumes continuity on U × [0,1] and holomorphy in z on U for each t. This is a standard and faithful relaxation; the statement only uses ψ on the required domain.
- Interval: NL uses [0,1]; Lean uses `Icc (0 : ℝ) 1` and integral `∫ t in 0..1`, which is the same.
- Holomorphic notion: Lean uses `DifferentiableOn ℂ`, which is the standard Mathlib notion corresponding to holomorphy.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts.

Final check: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the NL statement. No differences in mathematical meaning.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For all z ∈ ℂ, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean statements exactly match both inequalities, with the same domain (z : ℂ), the same absolute value (Complex.abs), and the same exponential (Real.exp of the real number |z|). Writing (1/2)*exp(|z|) is equivalent to (1/2) e^{|z|}. There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; only theorems are declared.
- No extra or missing hypotheses are introduced. Both parts of the natural language statement are presented as separate theorems.

Final check:
- The two math problems are the same. The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Note: The presence of `sorry` indicates missing proofs but does not affect the faithfulness of the formal statements to the original problem as per the auditing instructions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- The theorem `swap_conj {α : Type _} [DecidableEq α] (σ : Perm α) (x y : α) : swap (σ x) (σ y) = σ * swap x y * σ⁻¹` states a general conjugation identity in the permutation group on an arbitrary type with decidable equality: conjugating the transposition `swap x y` by `σ` yields the transposition that swaps `σ x` and `σ y`. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
- The docstring claims this specializes to the problem’s statement by taking `σ = β^{i-1}`, `x = 1`, `y = 2` with an appropriate indexing convention.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original statement (in Sym_n): Let n ≥ 2, α = (1,2), β = (1,2,...,n). For 1 < i < n, prove (i, i+1) = β^{i-1} α β^{-(i-1)} = β^{i-1} α β^{n-i+1}.
- The Lean theorem is a general fact about conjugation of a swap by an arbitrary permutation, not a direct formalization of the specific objects α, β in Sym_n. It does not define Fin n, does not define the n-cycle β, does not specify α = swap 1 2 in that context, and does not assert the equality for (i, i+1) or the condition 1 < i < n. It also does not include the second equality using β^{n-i+1} = β^{-(i-1)} (which relies on β^{n} = 1 in Sym_n).
- While the general lemma implies the first equality when properly instantiated (since β^{i-1}(1) = i and β^{i-1}(2) = i+1 for 1 < i < n), the code does not set up or state these instantiations, nor does it address the second equality with the exponent n-i+1.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- They are different. The Lean code states a general conjugation identity for swaps in any permutation group on an arbitrary type, whereas the original statement is a specific identity in Sym_n involving a particular n-cycle β and transposition α, the range condition on i, and the additional equality involving β^{n-i+1}. The Lean code neither introduces the specific permutations α, β on Fin n nor asserts the specific equalities for (i, i+1), and it omits the second equality altogether. The docstring notes the specialization but does not formalize it. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: The code is mathematically related and provides a general lemma that would imply part of the statement upon suitable instantiation, but it does not actually translate the stated problem into Lean, and it misses key specifics (Sym_n context, β definition, the i-range, and the second equality). Being strict, this warrants a non-faithful judgment with a mid-high score for relatedness.

- `Complex.abs ((Complex.sin z)⁻¹) ≥ Complex.abs ((Complex.sin (Complex.ofReal z.re))⁻¹)` states that the complex modulus (absolute value) of the reciprocal of sin z is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of the reciprocal of sin of the real part of z (with the real part coerced into a complex number via `Complex.ofReal`). Since `csc z` is defined as `1 / sin z`, this is exactly `|csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|` with both sides interpreted in the complex modulus. Using `Complex.ofReal z.re` ensures we are taking sin of the real part, viewed in ℂ.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is just a single theorem statement with a placeholder proof `by sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|.”
- Lean: For any `z : ℂ`, `| (sin z)⁻¹ | ≥ | (sin (ofReal (Re z)))⁻¹ |`.
- This is a direct formalization of the original statement. The use of `Complex.abs` matches the absolute value on complex numbers, and since `Re z` is real, `csc(Re z)` is real-valued when viewed as a complex number, so the complex modulus coincides with the real absolute value. Writing csc as `(sin ·)⁻¹` is mathematically equivalent. The coercion `Complex.ofReal z.re` is the correct way to evaluate the complex sine at the real part of z.

3) Final check and differences:
- No substantive differences: quantification, functions, and norms line up exactly. The only stylistic difference is writing csc via reciprocals and using complex sine at a real argument, which is standard and faithful. No vacuous placeholders or misleading definitions are present.

- theorem sinh_bound (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the absolute value |sinh z| is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp(|z|). That is, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- theorem cosh_bound (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the absolute value |cosh z| is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp(|z|). That is, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean theorems quantify over z : ℂ, matching z ∈ ℂ.
- They use Complex.abs for |·| on ℂ, matching the modulus.
- The right-hand side is (1/2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z), which is exactly (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- Inequalities are ≤, as in the statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; just theorem statements with proofs omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
They are the same. Both the sinh and cosh bounds are stated exactly as in the natural language statement, with correct domains and expressions. There are no discrepancies in constants, functions, or norms. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Complex.abs, Real.exp, Complex.sinh, Complex.cosh).

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's libraries.
- `theorem abs_add_sq (a b : ℂ) :`: Let a and b be complex numbers.
- `‖a + b‖ ^ 2 = ‖a‖ ^ 2 + ‖b‖ ^ 2 + 2 * (Complex.re (a * (starRingEnd ℂ b))) := by sorry`: The square of the complex modulus of a + b equals the square of the modulus of a plus the square of the modulus of b plus twice the real part of a multiplied by the complex conjugate of b. Here, `‖·‖` is the complex modulus, `^ 2` is the square, `Complex.re` denotes the real part, and `starRingEnd ℂ b` is the complex conjugate of b.

Assessment:
- The left-hand side `‖a + b‖ ^ 2` is exactly |a + b|^2.
- The right-hand side `‖a‖ ^ 2 + ‖b‖ ^ 2 + 2 * (Complex.re (a * (starRingEnd ℂ b)))` is |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a · conj(b)). In standard notation, this is 2 Re(a \bar b). Using `starRingEnd ℂ b` to denote conj(b) is standard in Mathlib and semantically identical to `Complex.conj b` or `star b`.
- All quantities are real as required. There are no auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions; it is a single theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation checking.

Final check:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: For a, b ∈ ℂ, |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b).
- No differences in meaning or scope. The use of `starRingEnd ℂ b` faithfully denotes \bar b.

- `theorem sin_norm_ge_sin_re_norm (z : Complex) : ‖Complex.sin z‖ ≥ |Real.sin z.re| := by sorry`
  - Declares a theorem named `sin_norm_ge_sin_re_norm`.
  - It is universally quantified over `z : Complex` (i.e., for all complex z).
  - The statement: the norm (absolute value) of the complex sine of z, written `‖Complex.sin z‖`, is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the real sine of the real part of z, `|Real.sin z.re|`.
  - `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; but this does not affect the statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|.
- Lean’s `‖Complex.sin z‖` correctly denotes the complex absolute value of sin z.
- Lean’s `|Real.sin z.re|` correctly denotes the real absolute value of sin(Re z).
- The universal quantification ""Let z ∈ ℂ"" is modeled by `(z : Complex)` with no extra assumptions. The inequality direction (≥) matches.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given.
- The use of Mathlib terms is standard and appropriate: `Complex.sin`, `Real.sin`, `z.re`, and the norm/absolute value notations.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes, they are the same. The Lean theorem exactly formalizes the given inequality for all complex z.
- No discrepancies in objects, quantifiers, or inequality direction.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.

- theorem complex_abs_sinh_le_exp_div_two (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry
  This asserts: For any complex number z, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|). The target type is an inequality in ℝ, using the complex modulus (Complex.abs) and the real exponential function Real.exp at |z|.
- theorem complex_abs_cosh_le_exp_div_two (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry
  This asserts: For any complex number z, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: For z in C, prove |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
The Lean theorems exactly state these two inequalities for arbitrary z : ℂ, with |·| modeled by Complex.abs and e^{·} modeled by Real.exp. The factor (1/2) appears explicitly as (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z), which is the same as (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain: z ∈ ℂ vs z : ℂ — matches.
- Functions: sinh and cosh of complex numbers — matches (Complex.sinh, Complex.cosh).
- Absolute value: |z| — matches (Complex.abs z).
- Exponential: e^{|z|} — matches (Real.exp (Complex.abs z)).
- Inequalities: ≤ with the factor 1/2 — matches.
- No extraneous definitions or placeholders are introduced. The presence of sorry means proofs are omitted, which is acceptable for translation checking as the statements themselves are correct.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- U : Set Complex, hU : IsOpen U — U is an open subset of ℂ.
- f : Complex → Complex — f is a function defined on all of ℂ (not just on U).
- hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U — f is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- hinj : Function.Injective f — f is injective on all of ℂ (global injectivity).
- Conclusion: ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0 — for every z in U, the (unrestricted) complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and injective (i.e., injective on U), then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Holomorphy: DifferentiableOn ℂ f U matches holomorphic on U. Good.
- Openness: IsOpen U matches. Good.
- Derivative: The statement uses f'(z) for z ∈ U. In Lean, deriv f z is the unrestricted derivative. Since U is open and hf gives differentiability on U, deriv f z aligns with the derivative of a function defined on U; this is acceptable.
- Injectivity: Here is the key mismatch. The natural language requires injectivity of f as a map U → ℂ (i.e., injective on U). The code requires Function.Injective f, i.e., injective on all of ℂ. This is strictly stronger than needed and not logically equivalent to injectivity on U. A faithful translation should use Set.InjOn f U (or equivalently, injective as a map U → ℂ) rather than global Function.Injective f.

Final check:
- Everything else aligns, but the injectivity hypothesis is too strong in the code. Therefore, the code does not faithfully translate the statement.

  Natural language: For any complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of |z|^(n+1) equals |z|/(1−|z|). Here ∑' is the infinite sum (tsum) in ℝ, since Complex.abs z : ℝ, and the summand is real. The exponent n+1 shifts the index so the sum runs over powers starting at 1 (i.e., ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n). No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 2: Assess fidelity to the original statement
- The Lean statement exactly matches the mathematical content: z ∈ ℂ, hypothesis |z| < 1, and the equality of the geometric series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n with |z|/(1−|z|).
- The indexing is correct: using `(n + 1)` with `n : ℕ` produces terms |z|^1, |z|^2, ...
- Types align: both sides are in ℝ, which is appropriate for absolute values.
- No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions are present.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- NL statement: ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1−|z|) for |z|<1, z ∈ ℂ.
- Lean statement: exactly this, expressed with tsum and shifted indexing.
- No discrepancies in domain, range, or conditions. No vacuous or placeholder definitions. The lack of proof (`sorry`) does not affect translation fidelity per the task instructions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The original statement: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sec z| ≥ |sec (Re z)|.
The Lean theorem states exactly: For all z : ℂ, |sec z| ≥ |sec (z.re : ℂ)|, using Complex.abs for |·| and interpreting Re z as a complex number via coercion. This matches the intended meaning.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness and potential pitfalls.
- The definition of sec as (cos z)⁻¹ is the standard algebraic definition over ℂ. While inv 0 = 0 in Lean makes sec total, this does not change the formal statement being asserted (an inequality of moduli for all z). Moreover, for points where cos z = 0, one also has cos (Re z) = 0 for complex cosine, so both sides evaluate to 0 in this formalization, and the inequality still matches the intended comparison (in usual mathematics one would regard sec as undefined/infinite there, but the stated inequality concerns magnitudes and the translation of the proposition as written remains correct). There are no vacuous placeholders; the only auxiliary definition is a faithful definition of sec.
- The use of Complex.abs matches the absolute value notation. Coercing z.re : ℝ to ℂ in sec (z.re : ℂ) is appropriate and preserves the intended meaning |sec(Re z)|.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: If the 2×2 matrix M represents a + i b, then M has two eigenvalues a ± i b with corresponding eigenvectors [1; ∓ i].
- The code defines precisely the standard representation matrix for a + i b. It then asserts the two eigenvector equations:
  • For eigenvalue a + i b, the vector is (1, −i) (i.e., [1; −i]).
  • For eigenvalue a − i b, the vector is (1, i) (i.e., [1; i]).
  This matches the “∓” pairing in the statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not explicitly assert that v_plus and v_minus are nonzero, which is part of the formal definition of “eigenvector” in linear algebra. However, the statement of the theorem provides the eigenvector equations that, together with the obvious fact that these vectors are nonzero, entail they are eigenvectors. The natural language statement typically does not separately emphasize nonzeroness when explicitly naming the eigenvectors, so this is a minor omission and does not materially change the mathematical meaning.
- The matrix is ℂ-valued rather than ℝ-valued, but the entries are real via Complex.ofReal, so it is the same standard representation and faithful to “represents a complex number a + i b”.
- No vacuous placeholders or bogus auxiliary definitions are used; M, v_plus, v_minus are concrete and correct. The theorem states exactly the intended eigen-relations.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement, with only a minor omission of explicitly stating the nonzeroness of the eigenvectors.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- All casts are appropriate (ℂ on the LHS terms, ℝ on the RHS), preserving the intended quantities.
- No differences from the original statement. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib. No mathematical content.
- Comment explains the intent: state inequalities |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) exp(|z|) and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) exp(|z|) for complex z, with proofs omitted. This matches the natural language claim.
- `open Complex`: Namespace convenience; no change in meaning.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 : ℝ) / 2 * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any z ∈ ℂ, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|). Here Complex.abs denotes the complex modulus (a real number), Real.exp is the real exponential, and 1/2 is a real scalar. Proof omitted via `sorry`.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 : ℝ) / 2 * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any z ∈ ℂ, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|). Again, proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean statements precisely assert these two inequalities for arbitrary z ∈ ℂ, using Complex.abs for |·| and Real.exp for e^{·}. The quantification “Let z ∈ ℂ” is modeled by taking an arbitrary parameter `(z : ℂ)` in each theorem. The constants and functions match exactly: 1/2 times exp of the modulus of z.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statements are present. Proofs are omitted, which is acceptable per the instructions.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. Both assert, for each complex number z, the two inequalities |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean code uses standard Mathlib notions (Complex.sinh, Complex.cosh, Complex.abs, Real.exp) and matches the exact mathematical meaning.

Note: While the mathematical truth of the cosh inequality is questionable for some z (e.g., real z), the task is to judge faithfulness of translation, not correctness. The code faithfully states what the natural language asks.

Natural language of the lemma: For a real ε > 0, a complex polynomial p, an assumption p ≠ 0, a point z0 ∈ ℂ with p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w ∈ ℂ with |w − z0| < ε such that |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

2) Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: Let ε > 0, let p be a nonconstant complex polynomial (or more generally a nonconstant power series converging on the disk {|z − z0| < ε}), and suppose p(z0) ≠ 0. Then there exists w in the disk {|w − z0| < ε} with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

Matches:
- ε > 0 captured by hε : 0 < ε.
- z0 : ℂ and the condition p(z0) ≠ 0 captured by h0 : Polynomial.eval z0 p ≠ 0.
- The conclusion ∃ w with |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)| matches exactly in the polynomial case.

Mismatches / Errors:
- Nonconstant polynomial vs p ≠ 0: The code uses (hnonconst : p ≠ 0). This is strictly weaker than “nonconstant.” It allows nonzero constant polynomials p = c ≠ 0, for which the conclusion is false (|p(w)| is constant, hence cannot be strictly less than |p(z0)|). The correct hypothesis should be “nonconstant,” e.g. ¬ p.IsConstant, or 0 < p.natDegree. As written, the Lean statement is not equivalent and is in fact false in allowed cases.
- Generality: The original also states the more general power series version (convergent on the given disk). The Lean code only treats polynomials and does not mention power series or convergence. This is a loss of generality relative to the stated theorem.

Other notes:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the only problem is the incorrect hypothesis and missing generality.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code asserts a strictly stronger conclusion from a weaker hypothesis (merely p ≠ 0), which makes the statement false for nonzero constant polynomials. It also omits the power series generalization. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  This states: For any complex number z and natural number n, the following inequality holds.
- Left-hand side: `Complex.abs ((Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.factorial k : Complex)) - Complex.exp z)` is |Σ_{k=0}^n z^k / k! − e^z|, since `Finset.range (n+1)` is {0,...,n}, `z^k / (Nat.factorial k : Complex)` is z^k divided by k! in Complex, and `Complex.exp z` is e^z.
- Right-hand side: `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (Nat.factorial (n + 1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is |z|^{n+1} / (n+1)! * e^{|z|}, with `Real.exp` applied to the real number |z| and factorial coerced to ℝ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: it universally quantifies over z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, has the partial sum Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k!, subtracts e^z, takes the complex absolute value, and bounds it by |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
- Type coercions (factorial to Complex inside the sum; factorial to ℝ on the RHS) are appropriate and do not change the mathematical meaning. The absolute value and exponentials are correctly chosen as Complex.abs and Real.exp, respectively, matching |·| and e^{·} on ℝ.
- Indexing via `Finset.range (n + 1)` correctly represents k = 0,...,n.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just a single theorem statement.

  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus |sin z| is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp(|z|). This is exactly |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} with |·| the complex modulus and e^ the real exponential.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:

- `import Mathlib` just imports the library.
- `theorem log_one_sub_z_bound (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry`
  This declares: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, we have a conjunction of two inequalities.
- The first inequality is `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ (∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ))` which reads: |log(1 − z)| ≤ Σ' over n ∈ ℕ of |z|^n / n. Here Complex.log is the principal complex logarithm; the sum is an infinite sum over natural numbers.
- The second inequality is `(∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` which reads: Σ' |z|^n / n ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|).
- The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the task instructions focusing on translation.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language states: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show that |log(1 − z)| ≤ Σ_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|). The Lean code matches this: it assumes z : ℂ, |z| < 1 and concludes exactly the two inequalities. The only cosmetic difference is that the Lean sum indexes over ℕ starting at 0. However, the n = 0 term is (|z|)^0 / 0. In Lean’s fields, 1/0 = 0, so the 0th term contributes 0, making the tsum equal to the sum from n = 1. Thus this is mathematically equivalent to the stated Σ_{n=1}^∞.
- Using Complex.log explicitly fixes the principal branch; for |z| < 1, 1 − z stays in the domain where the principal branch is analytic, and this matches the standard complex-analytic interpretation of log in the statement. So no mismatch there.
- Returning the two inequalities as a conjunction corresponds exactly to the chain of inequalities in the natural language.

3) Final check of sameness:
- Hypotheses: |z| < 1 in both.
- Conclusions: Two inequalities forming a chain with the same expressions.
- Indexing nuance (n from 0 vs from 1) is harmless and equivalent in Lean due to the n = 0 term being 0.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- Hypotheses: a function f : β → α, a functional equation hf: ∀ z w, f (z + w) = f z * f w, and a base value h0: f 0 = 1.
- Conclusion: ∀ z, f z ≠ 0. That is, f never takes the value 0.
- The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions as we only audit the statement/translation.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The NL problem first addresses e^z on ℂ, using e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 ≠ 0 to conclude e^z ≠ 0 for all z ∈ ℂ. Then it generalizes: if a function f satisfies f(z+w) = f(z)f(w) and f(0) = 1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z.
- The crucial ingredient used in the ℂ case is that 1 ≠ 0 in the codomain. In the general abstract statement, this must be assumed (e.g., Nontrivial α or (1:α) ≠ 0), otherwise the claim is false: if 1 = 0 in α, then the constant-zero function f ≡ 0 satisfies f(0) = 1 (since 1 = 0) and the multiplicative equation, but f z ≠ 0 fails.
- The Lean statement does not assume 1 ≠ 0 (no Nontrivial α and no hypothesis (1:α) ≠ 0). Therefore, as stated, the theorem is false in general and does not faithfully capture the intended generalization which relies on 1 ≠ 0.
- The generalization to an arbitrary additive group β (instead of ℂ) is fine and faithful, provided the missing nontriviality assumption on α is included.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The natural language implicitly requires 1 ≠ 0 (explicit in the ℂ case and used to derive the contradiction). The Lean code omits this requirement, making the theorem invalid in degenerate codomains (where 1 = 0). Thus the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced (good), but the missing 1 ≠ 0 assumption is a critical flaw.
- A faithful Lean statement would add [NeZero (1 : α)] or [Nontrivial α], or explicitly assume (1 : α) ≠ 0.

- Conclusion part 1: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (↑n + 1 : ℝ)`
  This states: |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑' over n : ℕ of |z|^(n+1) / (n+1). Since `∑' (n : ℕ)` is the sum from n = 0 to ∞, and the summand uses `(n+1)`, this equals ∑_{m=1}^∞ |z|^m / m. So this matches the left inequality.
- Conclusion part 2 (after `∧`): `(∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (↑n + 1 : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`
  This states: the same series is ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|), matching the right inequality.

Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show that |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean theorem assumes z : ℂ and |z| < 1, and concludes both inequalities as a conjunction. The sum is expressed with an index shift via `n+1`, which is equivalent to summing from 1 to ∞. The use of Complex.log and Complex.abs matches the complex absolute value and principal logarithm. The right-hand inequality uses real division and subtraction consistent with |z| being a real number.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the mathematical meaning of the natural language statement, expressing the same two inequalities under the same hypothesis, with correct handling of the series index. There are no extraneous assumptions or missing conditions.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- The natural language says “Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that …”, which corresponds to a universally quantified theorem over z, as given.
No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced, and there are no mismatches in the objects involved.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same mathematically. The Lean uses standard Mathlib notions (ℂ, norm ‖·‖, Complex.exp, Real.exp, z.re). There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the task, since we only audit the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

- import Mathlib / open Complex: Brings in math library and opens Complex namespace. No mathematical content change.
- theorem exp_partial_sum_error_bound (z : ℂ) (n : Nat) : ... ≤ ... := by sorry
  This declares the theorem for an arbitrary complex number z and natural number n.
  Left-hand side: Complex.abs ((Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) (fun k : Nat => z ^ k / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ)) ) - Complex.exp z)
  translates to |(∑_{k=0}^n z^k / k!) − e^z|, since Finset.range (n+1) indexes k = 0, ..., n, the factorial is cast to ℂ so the sum is in ℂ, and Complex.exp z is e^z in ℂ.
  Right-hand side: (Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.factorial (n+1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)
  translates to (|z|^{n+1}) / (n+1)! × e^{|z|}, with the factorial cast to ℝ and e^{|z|} as the real exponential.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The code states exactly the inequality: for all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
- Indexing matches (range (n+1) sums k = 0..n). Absolute value is Complex.abs, exponential is Complex.exp z on the LHS and Real.exp of |z| on the RHS, as in the original statement. Casting factorial to the appropriate field (ℂ on the left, ℝ on the right) is standard and faithful to the intended meaning.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a single theorem statement (proof omitted), which is allowed per the auditing instructions.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement matches the natural language statement exactly in mathematical meaning, including domains, indices, and functions involved.

- `theorem differentiable_on.deriv_ne_zero_locally_injective {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (h : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0) : ∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V, IsOpen V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ z ∈ V ∧ InjOn f V := ...`
  Natural language: Let U be an open subset of the complex plane, and let f : ℂ → ℂ be a function differentiable (holomorphic) on U. Assume that for every z in U, the complex derivative deriv f z is nonzero. Then for every z in U, there exists an open set V in ℂ such that V ⊆ U, z ∈ V, and f is injective on V (i.e., f is locally injective on U).

2) Assessing correspondence to the original statement:
- Original statement: U ⊂ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic; f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U; conclude f is locally injective on U.
- Lean version: Uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (i.e., holomorphic on U), which is the standard way in Mathlib to model a holomorphic function on an open set. The nonvanishing derivative hypothesis is given as ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0; since U is open and f is differentiable on U, deriv f z agrees with the usual complex derivative at z. The conclusion matches local injectivity: for each z ∈ U there is an open V with V ⊆ U, z ∈ V, and f is injective on V.
- The open set V is open in ℂ and contained in U, which is equivalent to being an open neighborhood of z in the subspace topology on U. Thus the formulation precisely captures “f is locally injective on U”.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain modeling: original has f : U → ℂ, while Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. This is a standard and faithful formalization; the conclusion restricts to V ⊆ U, so it matches the intended localized statement.
- Holomorphic vs DifferentiableOn ℂ: these are equivalent in Mathlib for complex functions on open sets.
- Derivative: using deriv f z (the usual derivative at z) is correct because U is open and f is differentiable there; it coincides with the usual complex derivative f'(z).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement itself faithfully encodes the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language claim.

- `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` is the conclusion: the modulus of the complex logarithm of (1 - z) is at most |z| divided by (1 - |z|).
- `:= by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this is acceptable per the task since we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For z in C with |z| < 1, we have |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The code states exactly this, using Mathlib’s Complex.abs for |·| and Complex.log for the complex principal logarithm. The types are consistent: both sides are real numbers, and the hypothesis matches |z| < 1.

3) Final check for equivalence and potential issues:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement.
- Uses standard Mathlib constants (Complex.abs, Complex.log). The theorem name being in a lowercase `complex` namespace is just a name and does not affect semantics.
- The natural statement does not specify a branch of the logarithm, but in Mathlib `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch, which coincides with the analytic continuation around 1 satisfying log(1) = 0, the standard interpretation in this context. This matches the intended meaning of the inequality for |z| < 1.
- Inequality direction and exact expression match.

- import Mathlib: Bring in Mathlib.
- open Complex: Open the Complex namespace.
- theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) : ... := by sorry: States a theorem for complex numbers z, w.
  The statement is the equality:
  LHS: 4 * z * ((w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I). Since w = w.re + w.im * I, the expression (w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I is exactly the complex conjugate of w, i.e. conj w. Thus the LHS is 4 z conj(w), i.e., 4 z\bar{w}.
  RHS: ofReal (Complex.abs (z + w) ^ 2 - Complex.abs (z - w) ^ 2) + I * ofReal (Complex.abs (z + I * w) ^ 2 - Complex.abs (z - I * w) ^ 2).
  Here Complex.abs is the complex modulus |·|, returning a real number. The ^2 is the real square. The differences are real numbers, then lifted to complex numbers with ofReal. The second difference is multiplied by I. So the RHS is (|z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2) + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2), viewed as a complex number.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The NL statement is the polarization identity: 4 z\bar{w} = |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2). The Lean statement matches exactly:
- 4 z\bar{w} matches 4 * z * ((w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I) = 4 z conj(w).
- |z±w|^2 matches Complex.abs (z ± w) ^ 2, lifted with ofReal to live in ℂ.
- i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2) matches I * ofReal (Complex.abs (z + I * w) ^ 2 - Complex.abs (z - I * w) ^ 2).
No additional hypotheses or alterations are introduced.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an unfinished proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Mathlib notions are used appropriately (Complex.abs, I, re, im, ofReal). Writing conj(w) explicitly as (w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I is mathematically equivalent.
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language polarization identity.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, no effect on the statement.
- The theorem `schwarz_lemma_unit_disk` states: for a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, assume
  - `hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1)`: f is holomorphic (analytic) on the open unit disk D = {z : ‖z‖ < 1}.
  - `hmap : ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1, ‖f z‖ < 1`: for every z in D, f(z) lies in D (i.e., f maps D into D).
  - `h0 : f 0 = 0`: the function fixes 0.
  Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖z‖`: for all z in D, |f(z)| ≤ |z|.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ 𝔻.” Here 𝔻 denotes the open unit disk in ℂ.
- The Lean statement faithfully captures: holomorphic on D (via AnalyticOn on the open ball), mapping D into D (via the bound ‖f z‖ < 1 for z ∈ D), f(0) = 0, and the conclusion |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z in D.
- Using a globally defined `f : ℂ → ℂ` but restricting analyticity and mapping conditions to the open unit ball is standard in Mathlib and equivalent to having a function defined on D only. The norm ‖·‖ is the complex modulus |·|.
- There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Final check:
- No extra assumptions are added; no essential assumptions are missing.
- The theorem statement matches the classical Schwarz lemma conclusion as stated.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: bring in Mathlib and open Complex namespace; fine.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_14036 (a b : ℂ) : ‖a + b‖ ^ 2 = ‖a‖ ^ 2 + ‖b‖ ^ 2 + 2 * (a * (b.re - b.im * I)).re := by sorry`
  This states for complex numbers `a, b`, the square of the norm of `a + b` equals the sum of the squares of the norms plus `2` times the real part of `a * (b.re - b.im * I)`. Note that in Complex, `b.re - b.im * I` is exactly `conj b`. Thus `(a * (b.re - b.im * I)).re = Re(a * conj b)`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: For `a,b ∈ ℂ`, show `|a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b)`.
- Lean theorem: `‖a + b‖ ^ 2 = ‖a‖ ^ 2 + ‖b‖ ^ 2 + 2 * (a * (b.re - b.im * I)).re` which is exactly `|a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a conj(b))`.
- Since `(b.re - b.im * I) = conj b`, the statements match exactly.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only difference is spelling out `conj b` as `b.re - b.im * I`, which is mathematically identical in Mathlib.
- Scalar `2 *` in Lean corresponds to `2 Re(...)` in the natural language; types match (all terms are real-valued).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: bring in Mathlib and open complex-number-specific notations and lemmas.
- `variable (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ)`: fix a complex-valued function f on ℂ and a point z0 in ℂ.
- The theorem `holomorphic_conformal_at_iff (h : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0) : ConformalAt (fun z => f z) z0 ↔ deriv f z0 ≠ 0` states: Assuming f is complex differentiable at z0 (i.e., holomorphic at z0), f is conformal at z0 if and only if the complex derivative of f at z0 is nonzero.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- NL: ""Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.""
- The Lean theorem assumes only local complex differentiability at z0 (DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0), whereas the NL statement assumes f is holomorphic (which typically means holomorphic on ℂ or at least on an open set; in any case, it implies differentiable at every point in its domain). The core equivalence is local at z0. Thus the Lean statement is slightly stronger (it requires only local holomorphicity at z0) but asserts exactly the desired equivalence at z0.
- The concepts used are correct Mathlib notions: ConformalAt, DifferentiableAt ℂ, and deriv.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Difference: the NL statement places a global assumption (f holomorphic), while the Lean statement uses the minimal local assumption at z0. The mathematical content about conformality at z0 being equivalent to a nonzero derivative is the same. The Lean version is strictly stronger in hypothesis (weaker assumptions) but does not change the conclusion. This is a minor mismatch in strength of hypotheses, not in the core statement.
- Conclusion: The translation is faithful to the intended meaning, with the minor difference that the Lean theorem assumes only local holomorphicity.

The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; it does not affect the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For any complex number z, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean statements precisely assert these two inequalities with standard Mathlib notation: Complex.abs for |·| on ℂ, Complex.sin and Complex.cos for sine and cosine on ℂ, and Real.exp for the exponential e^{·} on ℝ, applied to Complex.abs z. The factor (1/2) is represented as `(1 / 2 : ℝ)` and multiplied by `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`, which matches `(1/2) e^{|z|}`.
- The statement is split into two separate theorems; this is logically equivalent to stating both inequalities in one sentence.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain matches (z ∈ ℂ).
- Absolute value and exponential are correctly typed as real-valued, matching the intended magnitudes.

  Natural language: Let U be an open subset of ℂ. Let f be a function from ℂ to ℂ which is complex-differentiable on U and is globally injective on ℂ. Then for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.
  Notes:
  - `IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `f : ℂ → ℂ`: f is defined on all of ℂ (not just on U).
  - `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`: f is holomorphic on U.
  - `Injective f`: f is injective on all of ℂ (global injectivity).
  - Conclusion: For all z ∈ U, `deriv f z ≠ 0`.
  Because U is open and `hf` holds, using Mathlib, `DifferentiableOn` on an open set implies `DifferentiableAt` on that set, so `deriv f z` is well-defined for z ∈ U.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: If U ⊆ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective (on U), then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean statement requires: f is a function ℂ → ℂ and is injective on all of ℂ. This is strictly stronger than injective only on U. The differentiability assumption matches holomorphic on U. The conclusion matches (nonvanishing derivative on U).

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Differences:
  - Domain of f: NL has f : U → ℂ, Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ.
  - Injectivity: NL requires injective on U, Lean requires injective on all of ℂ.
  - The conclusion and differentiability assumptions otherwise align, and using `deriv f z` on an open set is appropriate.
- Verdict: The Lean theorem is stronger than the NL statement due to the global injectivity requirement and the global domain. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the original statement.

Other checks:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib predicates (`IsOpen`, `DifferentiableOn`, `Injective`, `deriv`).
- Proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task, since we only judge the statement.

Overall: Almost matches, but the global injectivity mismatch makes it not faithful.

- The Lean statement: ∀ z : ℂ, |cos z| ≥ |cos(z.re)|, with both cos and absolute value interpreted in the complex sense; for the right-hand side, `z.re` is coerced to ℂ.

On a purely real input `(z.re : Complex)`, `Complex.sin` returns a real-valued complex number with imaginary part 0; thus `Complex.abs (Complex.sin (z.re : Complex))` equals the real absolute value |sin(Re z)|. Hence the right-hand side matches the intended |sin(Re z)|.
- The quantification over `z : Complex` matches z ∈ ℂ.
- The inequality direction matches exactly.
- No auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is precise and standard Mathlib identifiers are used correctly.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement is exactly the formalization of the natural language statement. Using `Complex.sin` on `(z.re : Complex)` instead of `Real.sin z.re` is harmless and equivalent because the value is real and the complex modulus equals the real absolute value in that case.

No discrepancies found. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib. Fine.
- Docstring: ""For any complex z, the modulus of cos z is at least the modulus of cos (Re z)."" This matches the given natural language statement.
- Theorem: `theorem abs_cos_complex_ge_abs_cos_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ abs (Real.cos z.re) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|. Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus, `Complex.cos z` is the complex cosine, `z.re` is Re z, and `Real.cos z.re` is the real cosine applied to the real part. The inequality is ≥, as in the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The theorem quantifies over arbitrary z ∈ ℂ and states exactly the inequality |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|. No extra hypotheses or changed notions. The use of `abs` on the right is Real absolute value (via the generic `abs` on ℝ), which matches |·| for reals. This is a faithful translation.

3) Final check for mismatches:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No changes in quantifiers or inequality direction.
- Uses standard Mathlib constructs appropriately.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per instructions we're checking translation, not proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_15383_sin (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|). The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is clear.

  This states: For every complex number z, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|). Again, proof omitted.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The code asserts exactly these two inequalities using Complex.abs for modulus, Complex.sin and Complex.cos for the complex sine and cosine, and Real.exp for e^{·}. The quantification over all z : Complex is explicit. The multiplicative factor (1/2) matches. There are no extraneous assumptions or changes.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary definitions are introduced, and there are no vacuous placeholders except that proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing. The statements precisely match the requested inequalities.

Grade rationale: Exact, faithful translation of both inequalities with correct domains and functions.

- `theorem complex_abs_tanh_le_tanh_abs_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.tanh z) ≤ Real.tanh (abs (Complex.re z)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of tanh z is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic tangent of the absolute value of the real part of z. Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus |·| on ℂ, `Complex.tanh` is the complex hyperbolic tangent, `Complex.re z` is the real part of z (a real number), `abs` is the real absolute value, and `Real.tanh` is the real hyperbolic tangent.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean theorem precisely states: ∀ z ∈ ℂ, |tanh z| ≤ tanh(|Re z|). This matches the natural language statement exactly: same domain (ℂ), same functions (complex tanh and modulus on the left, real tanh of the absolute value of the real part on the right), and same inequality.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`). The task only requires the statement to match; the proof is not relevant for this audit.

- “Purely imaginary” is standardly interpreted as “real part zero.” The Lean side uses exactly that characterization. Also, the expression used in Lean is algebraically the conjugate of w. Thus, the two statements coincide exactly.

3) Final check for discrepancies:

- The natural language statement asks to prove |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|, i.e., |1/sin z| ≥ |1/sin(Re z)|.
- The Lean theorem asserts the opposite inequality: |1/sin z| ≤ |1/sin(Re z)|.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not faithful; it states the reverse inequality.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are different. The inequality direction is flipped (≥ in the NL statement vs ≤ in the Lean code). This is a substantive change.
- Note: Independently of correctness or domain issues (e.g., behavior at zeros of sin), the translation fails because the asserted inequality direction is not the same as in the natural language statement.

  Natural language: Let f: ℂ → ℂ. Assume for every z with |z| < 1, we have |f(z)| < 1 (so f maps the open unit disk into itself). Assume f(0) = 0. Assume f is complex differentiable at 0. Then |f′(0)| ≤ 1.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: “Suppose f: 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f′(0)| ≤ 1.” That is, f is holomorphic on the open unit disk (an open set), and maps the disk into itself.
- Lean code: Requires only differentiable at 0 (DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0), not holomorphic in a neighborhood or on the whole disk. It also takes f: ℂ → ℂ and imposes the mapping property |f z| < 1 for all |z| < 1, which is fine for the mapping aspect but does not encode holomorphicity on the disk.

Key differences:
- The crucial holomorphic-on-𝔻 hypothesis is missing. The code only assumes complex differentiability at a single point (0), which is far weaker than holomorphic on an open set. This is not a faithful translation of “holomorphic on 𝔻”.
- Domain type difference (ℂ → ℂ with a mapping property vs f: 𝔻 → 𝔻) is acceptable if holomorphic-on-𝔻 were captured via HolomorphicOn or AnalyticOn; but it is not present.
- The conclusion and mapping property otherwise match the intended shape: |f′(0)| ≤ 1, and |f(z)| < 1 for |z| < 1.

Final check:
- The Lean statement is strictly weaker than the original and in fact false under such weak assumptions (one can define a function equal to c·z near 0 with c > 1, modify it away from 0 to keep |f(z)| < 1 on the whole disk, yielding DifferentiableAt at 0 with |f′(0)| = c > 1). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- No vacuous placeholders; the structure is close, but omitting holomorphic-on-𝔻 is a substantive mismatch. Extra harsh grading leads to a 7.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib standard library.
- Comment: Indicates the goal is to state definitions of cosh and sinh for complex numbers.
- `theorem cosh_eq_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.cosh z = (Complex.exp z + Complex.exp (-z)) / (2 : ℂ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, cosh z equals (e^z + e^{-z})/2. Here `Complex.cosh` is cosh on ℂ, `Complex.exp` is the complex exponential, and `(2 : ℂ)` is the complex number 2.
- `theorem sinh_eq_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.sinh z = (Complex.exp z - Complex.exp (-z)) / (2 : ℂ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, sinh z equals (e^z − e^{-z})/2.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement asks to prove for z ∈ ℂ the two identities cosh z = (e^z + e^{-z})/2 and sinh z = (e^z − e^{-z})/2. The Lean code states exactly these two theorems for arbitrary complex z, using the canonical Mathlib names `Complex.cosh`, `Complex.sinh`, and `Complex.exp`. No extra hypotheses or alterations are present.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: ℂ in both.
- Statements: Identical equalities for cosh and sinh.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only theorem statements. Using Mathlib's standard notions is appropriate.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_15663 (z : ℂ) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry`
  Assumptions: z is a complex number with |z| < 1. Claim: a conjunction of two inequalities holds.
- First inequality: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (n+1 : ℝ)`.
  This states |log(1 − z)| ≤ sum over n = 0..∞ of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1), i.e., equivalently ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n.
- Second inequality: `∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (n+1 : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`.
  This states the series is bounded above by |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The result is given as a conjunction `∧`, i.e., both inequalities are proved simultaneously.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean code exactly encodes this: same hypothesis |z| < 1, same left-hand inequality using Complex.log (principal branch; for |z|<1, 1−z avoids the branch cut, so this is the standard choice), same series (with an index shift n ↦ n+1), and the same right-hand bound |z|/(1−|z|). Combining the two inequalities via `∧` is entirely faithful to the chained inequality format in the NL statement.
- The use of `tsum` over ℕ with term `(abs z)^(n+1)/(n+1 : ℝ)` matches ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean starts at n = 0 with exponent n+1 and denominator n+1; NL starts at n = 1. These are identical sums under reindexing.
- Domain and functions: Complex.log (principal) corresponds to the intended complex logarithm near 1; the modulus and sums are real-valued as in the NL statement.
- Both inequalities are present and in the same form. No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; standard Mathlib terms are used.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_15413 (z : Complex) (n : Nat) :` For every complex number z and natural number n, we have the following inequality.
- `Complex.abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.factorial k : Complex) - Complex.exp z) ≤ ...` The left-hand side is the complex absolute value of the finite sum over k = 0, 1, ..., n of the term `(z^k / k!) - e^z`. That is, it is |Σ_{k=0}^n (z^k/k! − e^z)|. Note: this equals |(Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) − (n+1) e^z|.
- `... ≤ (Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.factorial (n+1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` The right-hand side is (|z|^{n+1} / (n+1)!) * e^{|z|}, as a real number.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The intended LHS is |(Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) − e^z|, i.e., subtracting e^z once from the whole partial sum.
- The Lean code instead computes Σ_{k=0}^n (z^k/k! − e^z) = (Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) − (n+1) e^z. This is a substantial mismatch: the subtraction of e^z is inside the sum, not outside. Therefore the proposition being stated is different.
- All other components (indexing 0..n using `Finset.range (n+1)`, use of Complex.exp, absolute value, and the RHS form with factorial and Real.exp of |z|) match the intended meaning.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same. The Lean code proves an inequality for |Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − (n+1) e^z|, whereas the original requires |Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z|. Parentheses/placement of the subtraction are incorrect.
- No auxiliary definitions; the failure is solely due to the misplacement of `- Complex.exp z` inside the sum.

Grade rationale:
- Almost faithful apart from a critical but simple bracketing error. This merits a high but not passing score.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each Lean line to natural language.
- The file imports Mathlib and opens the Complex namespace. No auxiliary definitions are introduced.
- Theorem exp_conj_eq_conj_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.exp ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.exp z)
  Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ, exp(conj z) = conj(exp z). Here starRingEnd ℂ is the complex conjugation map on ℂ.
- Theorem sin_conj_eq_conj_sin (z : ℂ) : Complex.sin ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.sin z)
  Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ, sin(conj z) = conj(sin z).
- Theorem cos_conj_eq_conj_cos (z : ℂ) : Complex.cos ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.cos z)
  Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ, cos(conj z) = conj(cos z).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The original statement asks to show, for z ∈ ℂ: e^{\overline z} = \overline{e^z}, sin(\overline z) = \overline{\sin z}, and cos(\overline z) = \overline{\cos z}. Each Lean theorem exactly asserts the corresponding equality, using Complex.exp/sin/cos for e^z/sin z/cos z and using starRingEnd ℂ to denote complex conjugation. No auxiliary placeholders or vacuous definitions are used; only theorem statements (with omitted proofs) are present.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
Yes. Each of the three Lean theorem statements precisely matches the three target equalities. Using starRingEnd ℂ (the conjugation as a ring endomorphism) is standard and equivalent to Complex.conj. There are no extra hypotheses or missing conditions. The presence of sorry in proofs does not affect the faithfulness of the translation of the statements.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem arg_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.arg (Complex.exp z) = z.im := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, the principal argument (Complex.arg) of the complex exponential e^z equals the imaginary part of z.
- `theorem abs_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, the absolute value (modulus) of e^z equals e raised to the real part of z.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that Arg(e^z) = Im z and |e^z| = e^{Re z}.”
- The Lean code exactly formalizes both claims for all z ∈ ℂ: Arg(e^z) = Im z and |e^z| = e^{Re z}.
- The symbol Arg is naturally interpreted as the principal argument in mathlib via `Complex.arg`, and |·| is `Complex.abs`. `Re z` and `Im z` correspond to `z.re` and `z.im` in Lean. `e^z` corresponds to `Complex.exp z`, and `e^{Re z}` to `Real.exp z.re`.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there are only theorem statements.
- The mapping of Arg to `Complex.arg` is standard and appropriate.
- The statements are universally quantified over z, matching the NL phrasing.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement. (Whether the statement is mathematically true without a modulo 2π qualification is a separate issue; here we judge only the fidelity of translation.)

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: bring in Mathlib and open the Complex namespace.
- The theorem `det_of_complex_rep (ξ ζ : ℂ)` states the real-number identity
  (ξ.re + ζ.re) * (ξ.re - ζ.re) - (-ξ.im + ζ.im) * (ξ.im + ζ.im) = Complex.normSq ξ - Complex.normSq ζ.
  Here, `Complex.normSq ξ` is |ξ|^2 = (Re ξ)^2 + (Im ξ)^2. So the statement is purely an algebraic identity in the real and imaginary parts of ξ and ζ.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The NL statement: If a 2×2 real matrix M represents the real-linear map z ↦ ξ z + ζ z̄, then det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- The standard real 2×2 matrix for z ↦ ξ z + ζ z̄ in the basis {1, i} is
  [[Re ξ + Re ζ,  Im ζ − Im ξ],
   [Im ξ + Im ζ,  Re ξ − Re ζ]],
  whose determinant is (Re ξ + Re ζ)(Re ξ − Re ζ) − (Im ζ − Im ξ)(Im ξ + Im ζ) = (ξ.re + ζ.re)(ξ.re − ζ.re) − (−ξ.im + ζ.im)(ξ.im + ζ.im), i.e., exactly the LHS of the Lean identity. Thus the Lean LHS is indeed the determinant of the representing matrix, and the RHS is |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- However, the Lean theorem never mentions the matrix M, determinants, or the representation by the real-linear map. It only proves a standalone algebraic equality. The connection “LHS = det M” is not stated or formalized in the Lean code.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Content-wise, the algebraic identity in Lean matches the determinant formula for the representing matrix, so numerically it is the same equality one would use to conclude det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- But as a translation, the Lean statement omits the matrix M, the determinant operator, and the representation assumption. It does not assert that the LHS is det M; it only states an equality of real numbers. Under the strict auditing criteria, this is not a faithful translation of the original statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the use of `Complex.normSq` is appropriate. The shortcoming is the missing explicit linkage to the determinant of the constructed real matrix.

Given the requirement to be extra harsh and the need for the statement to explicitly reflect the matrix/determinant context, this does not pass as a faithful translation.

- The theorem declaration
  `theorem abs_sinh_le_cosh_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (sinh z) ≤ Real.cosh z.re := by sorry`
  states: For any complex number z, the complex modulus |sinh z| is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic cosine of the real part of z, i.e., |sinh z| ≤ cosh(Re z). No auxiliary definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: “Let z in C. Prove that |sinh z| ≤ cosh(Re z).” The Lean theorem universally quantifies over z : ℂ and concludes Complex.abs (sinh z) ≤ Real.cosh z.re, which is exactly the same mathematical claim. The use of Complex.abs for modulus and Real.cosh for cosh on the real part matches the intended meanings.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification: NL says “Let z ∈ ℂ,” which is standardly read as arbitrary z; Lean uses explicit universal quantification (z : ℂ). Equivalent.
- Functions and domains: sinh is the complex hyperbolic sine; cosh is applied to the real part, hence a real cosh. This matches the NL expression cosh(Re z).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present; only a single theorem statement. The presence of `sorry` affects only the proof, not the statement.

- `theorem log_one_sub_series (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) :` introduces a theorem asserting: for a complex number z with |z| < 1.
- `Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' n : ℕ, z^(n+1) / (n+1)` states the conclusion: the principal complex logarithm of (1 - z) equals minus the infinite sum over all natural numbers n of z^(n+1)/(n+1). The `∑'` indicates an infinite sum (tsum) over n ∈ ℕ. The indexing using n+1 means the sum effectively starts at 1, giving −∑_{k=1}^∞ z^k/k after the change of variables k = n+1.
- `:= by sorry` means the proof is omitted; we only care about the statement for translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove log(1 − z) = −∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n.
- Lean: For z : Complex with Complex.abs z < 1, `Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' n : ℕ, z^(n+1) / (n+1)`.
- This matches exactly, modulo the standard reindexing of the infinite series from n = 0 with term n+1 to n = 1. The use of `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm, which is the standard interpretation for such series expansions in the unit disk (and consistent with log(1)=0). Thus the mathematical content matches the intended statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Code uses n starting at 0 with n+1 shift; equivalent to starting at 1. No difference in meaning.
- Domain and hypothesis: Both specify z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1; matches.
- Function: Uses complex log; natural language ""log"" in a complex context is standardly the principal log. No problematic mismatch.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given.

  Natural language: For any complex number z ≠ 0, the principal complex logarithm has a complex derivative at z equal to 1/z.

2) Does this faithfully translate the original statement?
Original: “Let z ∈ C. Show that arctan' z = 1/(1+z^2) and log'(z) = 1/z where defined.” The crucial phrase is “where defined,” which, for complex functions with branch issues, means: the derivative formula holds on the domain where the chosen single-valued branch is complex differentiable (holomorphic). For the principal branches in Mathlib:
- Complex.log is defined on all ℂ (with a principal branch), but it is holomorphic only on the slit plane ℂ \ (−∞, 0], and not complex differentiable at points on the negative real axis (despite being defined there). Thus the correct derivative statement is: HasDerivAt Complex.log (1/z) z holds for z not on the branch cut (in particular not 0 and not on (−∞,0]). The code assumes merely z ≠ 0, which is too weak: it includes points on the negative real axis, where HasDerivAt fails. So the translation overstates the domain.
- Complex.arctan has branch points at ±i and branch cuts extending from them, so the derivative formula 1/(1+z^2) holds where arctan is holomorphic, which excludes more than just z with 1 + z^2 = 0. The code only assumes 1 + z^2 ≠ 0, which again is too weak and includes points on the branch cuts where the derivative does not exist. So it overstates the domain here too.

Using HasDerivAt is an appropriate Mathlib way to express the derivative at a point. However, the hypotheses in the code do not match the intended “where defined” domains; they are insufficient and make the statements stronger than warranted, hence not faithful to the intended meaning.

3) Final check and differences:
- For log: Code claims derivative at all z ≠ 0; correct domain should exclude the branch cut (in particular the negative real axis), so the code is not faithful.
- For arctan: Code excludes only ±i via 1+z^2 ≠ 0; correct domain must also exclude branch cuts from ±i, so again not faithful.
- No vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib terms are used; proofs omitted are acceptable. The mismatch is entirely in domain restrictions.

Overall: The mathematical meanings are not the same due to incorrect domain restrictions; hence the translation fails.

- Original: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove ∑_{n=1}^{∞} |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|).
- Lean: Exactly the same inequality, with the sum written as a shifted tsum over ℕ, which is standard and equivalent. The denominator and quantities are real, consistent with abs values.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (allowed per instructions).

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?

- Critical mismatch 1 (domain): The original has f : U → ℂ, while the Lean code assumes f : ℂ → ℂ that is only assumed differentiable on U. This is a stronger assumption than necessary. While often harmless for analysis statements, it is not a faithful translation.
- Critical mismatch 2 (injectivity): The original needs injectivity on U (equivalently, injectivity of the restricted function U → ℂ), while the Lean code requires Function.Injective f globally on ℂ. This is strictly stronger than the original hypothesis. A faithful encoding would use Set.InjOn f U or Injective (fun z : U => f z).

No auxiliary bogus definitions are present, and the predicates used are standard. However, the strengthened hypothesis (global injectivity and domain ℂ → ℂ) makes the Lean statement not a faithful translation of the original.

Final check: The problems are different because the Lean version imposes strictly stronger assumptions (global injectivity and global domain) than the original, which only requires injectivity and definition of f on U.

1) Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib / open Set: Brings in Mathlib and opens the Set namespace. No mathematical content change.
- Theorem statement: max_modulus_local {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (z0 : ℂ) (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) (hmax : IsLocalMax (fun z => ‖f z‖) z0) : ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ z0 ∈ V ∧ (∀ z ∈ V, f z = f z0).
  Natural language: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open. Let f: ℂ → ℂ be a function, differentiable (holomorphic) on U. Take z0 ∈ U. Assume that |f| has a local maximum at z0 in the ambient space ℂ (i.e., there is an open neighborhood of z0 in ℂ on which ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖f z0‖). Then there exists an open set V ⊆ ℂ with z0 ∈ V such that f is constant on V, i.e., ∀ z ∈ V, f z = f z0.

2) Faithfulness check against the original statement
Original: U ⊂ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic. If |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U (interpreted relative to U), then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0 (typically a neighborhood within U).
- Domain modeling: The Lean code models f as ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (standard in Mathlib for holomorphic on U). This is acceptable.
- Local maximum hypothesis: The original means a local maximum with respect to the domain U (relative topology). In Mathlib this corresponds to IsLocalMaxOn (fun z => ‖f z‖) U z0. The code instead assumes IsLocalMax (fun z => ‖f z‖) z0, which is a local maximum in the ambient ℂ, not restricted to U. This is strictly stronger than the intended assumption when U is open. Hence the hypothesis does not faithfully match the natural language statement.
- Conclusion: The original says ""constant in a neighborhood of z0"" (usually within U). The code concludes existence of an open V in ℂ with z0 ∈ V and constancy on V, without requiring V ⊆ U. This is stronger than necessary and not literally the same formulation. While stronger conclusions are not incorrect mathematically, they are not a faithful translation of the original phrasing.

3) Final comparison
- Differences:
  - Uses IsLocalMax instead of IsLocalMaxOn U: stronger hypothesis than the original.
  - Does not require the neighborhood V to be contained in U.
- Everything else (openness of U, holomorphicity modeled by DifferentiableOn, notion of |f| via ‖f z‖, and constancy near z0) aligns.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation; it is a strictly stronger version of the intended result.

Given the above, there are no vacuous definitions, and the Mathlib notions are standard. However, the mismatch in the domain of the local maximum and the target neighborhood means it is not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `theorem local_structure_of_zeros_of_holomorphic_function {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U)`:
  U is an open subset of ℂ.
- `{f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`:
  f is a function ℂ → ℂ, holomorphic on U (complex-differentiable on U).
- `{z0 c : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) (hfv : f z0 = c) (hder : HasDerivAt f (0 : ℂ) z0)`:
  z0 ∈ U, f(z0) = c, and the complex derivative of f at z0 exists and equals 0.
- Conclusion:
  `(∀ z ∈ U, f z = c) ∨ ∃ (m : ℕ) (hm : 1 ≤ m) (V : Set ℂ) (hV : IsOpen V) (hz0V : z0 ∈ V) (g : ℂ → ℂ) (hg : DifferentiableOn ℂ g V), (∀ z ∈ V, f z = c + (z - z0) ^ m * g z) ∧ g z0 ≠ 0`.
  Either f is identically c on U, or there exists an integer m ≥ 1, an open neighborhood V of z0, and a holomorphic function g on V with g(z0) ≠ 0 such that for all z ∈ V, f(z) = c + (z − z0)^m g(z).

This matches the standard local factorization asserting that z0 is a zero of f − c of order m.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language statement:
- U is a domain (open and connected) and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant.
- If f(z0) = c and f′(z0) = 0, then either f ≡ c or else z0 is a zero of f − c of order m and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f⁻¹(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity).

Lean theorem vs NL:
- Domain vs open: Lean assumes U is open, not necessarily connected (domain). This is a mismatch in hypotheses, though the result is local and does not use connectedness.
- Nonconstant assumption: The NL includes “nonconstant”, but then states a disjunction “either f ≡ c or else …”. In Lean, there is no nonconstant assumption; the disjunction remains. This is a mismatch in hypotheses, but the conclusion’s disjunction covers both cases; still, the stated assumptions are not faithfully mirrored.
- Function domain: NL has f : U → ℂ; Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ and only assumes holomorphic on U. This is acceptable in spirit, but then the neighborhood V in Lean is not required to be contained in U, which is a mismatch given the NL context (where f is only defined on U). A faithful translation should require V ⊆ U or have f defined on U.
- Main conclusion:
  • The Lean statement provides the factorization f(z) = c + (z − z0)^m g(z) with g holomorphic on V and g(z0) ≠ 0, which encodes “z0 is a zero of order m”. This matches the “zero of order m” part of the NL.
  • However, the Lean theorem does not state the explicit counting statement: “there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f⁻¹(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity)”. While this counting is a standard corollary of the factorization (since g ≠ 0 near z0), it is not part of the formal conclusion. Therefore, the translation omits an explicit component of the NL statement.

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
- Differences:
  1) The NL assumes U is a domain (open and connected) and f is nonconstant; the Lean theorem only assumes U is open and does not include nonconstant.
  2) The Lean theorem allows V to be any open neighborhood of z0 in ℂ, not necessarily contained in U. In the NL, since f : U → ℂ, V should be in U.
  3) The Lean theorem does not explicitly include the multiplicity counting statement about f⁻¹(c) ∩ V having exactly m points (with multiplicity). It only gives the factorization from which this follows. This is a substantive omission relative to the NL’s explicit claim.

Given these discrepancies, especially the omission of the explicit counting conclusion and the lack of V ⊆ U, the translation is not fully faithful.

- `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted; not relevant to translation fidelity.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show that ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 − |z|). The Lean statement asserts exactly this, formulating the series as `∑' (n : ℕ), |z|^(n+1)` (equivalent to starting at 1) and concluding the same closed form. The domain of the sum is ℝ via |z|, matching the intended meaning.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Set Metric: Using Mathlib and standard Set/Metric notions.
- The theorem statement critical_points_isolated: Given U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U and f : ℂ → ℂ with hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (i.e., f is complex differentiable at every point of U), and hfnc : ¬ ∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c (i.e., f is not constant on U), then for every z0 ∈ U, if deriv f z0 = 0, there exists r > 0 such that for all z ∈ U, if dist z z0 < r then (deriv f z = 0 → z = z0). In words: each critical point z0 of f in U is isolated in U; there’s a small ball around z0 (considered inside U) that contains no other critical points.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the natural language statement.
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f not constant. Show the set { z ∈ U : f'(z) = 0 } is discrete in U.
- Lean encodes f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. Since U is open, DifferentiableOn on U matches the usual notion of being holomorphic on U, and ‘deriv f z’ matches the complex derivative at z ∈ U. The non-constancy is exactly ¬ ∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c.
- The conclusion “∀ z0 ∈ U, deriv f z0 = 0 → ∃ r > 0, …” expresses that each critical point has a neighborhood in U containing no other critical points, which is precisely the definition that the set of critical points is discrete in U.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain modeling: Natural language has f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. For open U, this is a standard and faithful modeling; the derivative at z0 ∈ U depends only on values in a neighborhood inside U, so the extension outside U is irrelevant.
- Holomorphic vs differentiable: DifferentiableOn ℂ f U captures holomorphic on U. Using deriv (not derivWithin) is fine because U is open, so DifferentiableOn implies DifferentiableAt at points of U and deriv agrees with the complex derivative.
- Discreteness: The metric formulation given is equivalent to the discrete-in-U property.
- Non-constancy: The assumption matches the natural language: not constant on U. Note: In general, for a disconnected U, the mathematical statement is subtly false if f is constant on a component; however, the natural language statement also lacks a connectedness assumption, so the Lean statement matches it exactly as written.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

- NL: S ⊆ U has an accumulation point in U. Lean encodes this as existence of z0 ∈ U with `z0 ∈ closure (S \ {z0})`, which is precisely the topological definition of accumulation point.
- NL: f(z) = g(z) for all z ∈ S. Matches `∀ z ∈ S, f z = g z`.
- NL: conclude f ≡ g on U. Matches `∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain modeling difference (f, g defined on ℂ vs on U) is standard and faithful.
- The accumulation point condition is correctly captured.
- No extra or missing assumptions relative to the NL statement. Note: Neither the NL statement nor the Lean code assumes U is connected; both conclude equality on all of U under the same hypotheses. Thus, despite the classical theorem usually requiring connectedness for a global conclusion, the Lean statement faithfully mirrors the given NL statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a proof hole, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 3: Key differences/mismatches
- Missing containment V ⊆ U: In the natural language, f is only defined on U, so V must be a neighborhood of p inside U (usually V ⊆ U and open in ℂ). The Lean statement does not require V ⊆ U. Since hf only gives holomorphy on U, asserting the existence of such a V without restricting it to lie in U is a materially different (and in fact stronger) formulation than the original. For a faithful translation, the conclusion should include V ⊆ U (or alternatively, the domain should have been f : U → ℂ and then injectivity of the restriction is automatic).
- Other aspects are faithful: Using DifferentiableOn ℂ to mean holomorphic is standard in Mathlib; using deriv f p is appropriate; expressing injectivity on V via the ∀ x y formulation is equivalent to f|_V being injective; and IsOpen (f '' V) matches f(V) open.

Conclusion: The statement is very close but not fully faithful because it omits the crucial requirement V ⊆ U, which is necessary given the original domain f : U → ℂ.

  - U is open; f is holomorphic on U (Lean: DifferentiableOn ℂ f U); p ∈ U; deriv f p ≠ 0.
  - Existence of open neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p).
  - f restricts to a bijection V → W (injOn + surjOn + mapsTo capture this).
  - There is an inverse g defined on W that is holomorphic (DifferentiableOn ℂ g W) and satisfies g ∘ f = id on V and f ∘ g = id on W.
- Key mismatch:
  - Domain of f: The NL statement treats f as a function with domain U (f : U → ℂ). The Lean code models f as a total function ℂ → ℂ and only assumes differentiability on U.
  - Crucially, the Lean conclusion does not require V ⊆ U. In the NL statement, f : V → W only makes sense if V ⊆ U (since f is defined only on U). In the Lean version, because f is total, it can be evaluated on any V, potentially outside U, which changes the problem and weakens the tie to the hypothesis that f is holomorphic on U.
  - Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation: it should include V ⊆ U (e.g., V ⊆ U or V ⊆ interior U, but with U open, V ⊆ U) to mirror that f is only defined/holomorphic on U.

Step 3: Final check
- The two statements are close but not the same. The missing constraint V ⊆ U and the change of domain from f : U → ℂ to f : ℂ → ℂ are substantive differences in formalization. Under the strict auditing guidelines, this fails faithfulness.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic, p ∈ U, and f'(p) ≠ 0, then for sufficiently small δ > 0, f restricted to the disk Δ_δ(p) is injective.
- Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability on U and explicitly ensures `Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U`. This faithfully models f : U → ℂ and the restriction to a small disk inside U.
- `Metric.ball p δ` is the open disk Δ_δ(p). The quantified injectivity condition is exactly injectivity of the restriction of f to that disk.
- The phrase “for sufficiently small δ” is equivalent to “∃ δ > 0 such that ...” since injectivity on a set implies injectivity on all smaller disks; the Lean statement captures this by existence of some δ.
- The use of `DifferentiableOn ℂ` for holomorphic and `deriv f p` for f'(p) is standard in Mathlib and appropriate given U is open and p ∈ U.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement using standard Mathlib notions.

Final check: The Lean theorem and the natural language statement match in mathematical meaning. Any minor formal differences (domain of f) are bridged by including `Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U` and are standard in Mathlib formalizations. The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex; open Topology` are setup and namespace openings.
- The theorem is named `open_mapping_holomorphic_nonconstant` and is stated for:
  - `{U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U)`: U is an open subset of the complex plane.
  - `{f : ℂ → ℂ}`: a function from ℂ to ℂ. We will restrict it to U when considering the map.
  - `(hfd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
  - `(h_nonconst : ∃ z w, z ∈ U ∧ w ∈ U ∧ f z ≠ f w)`: f is nonconstant on U (there exist two points in U with distinct images).
  - Conclusion: `IsOpenMap (fun x : Subtype U => f x.val)`: the restriction of f to U, viewed as a function from the subtype U (with the subspace topology) to ℂ, is an open map (i.e., it sends open sets in U to open sets in ℂ).

Assessment of correspondence to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Let U ⊂ ℂ be open and f: U → ℂ be holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f is an open mapping.”
- Lean’s `f : ℂ → ℂ` with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` and then considering `fun x : Subtype U => f x.val` is a standard way to express a function defined on U. This matches the intent of “f: U → ℂ.”
- `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` is the Mathlib notion of holomorphic on U, so “holomorphic” is captured correctly.
- The nonconstancy assumption is expressed as existence of two points in U with different images, which is the usual meaning of “nonconstant.”
- The conclusion uses `IsOpenMap` for the restriction to U, precisely expressing that f is an open map from U (with subspace topology) to ℂ.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement precisely matches the NL statement’s hypotheses and conclusion, modulo the standard Lean encoding of a function defined on an open set as a global function restricted to that set.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only Mathlib concepts are used.
- Note: Both versions omit a connectedness hypothesis; this matches faithfully (even though the theorem as stated is generally only true on connected domains unless one requires nonconstancy on each component). Since our task is fidelity, not correctness, the translation is faithful.

- Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn f U to encode holomorphic on U; this is standard in Mathlib and faithful. The explicit derivative datum f' with HasDerivAt f f' p and f' ≠ 0 matches “f'(p) ≠ 0.” The conclusion provides an open V with p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and injectivity of f on V (Set.InjOn), which is exactly “f restricted to V is injective.” Requiring V ⊆ U aligns with the intended meaning since in the NL statement f is only defined on U, so V should lie in U.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: NL has f : U → ℂ; Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability only on U. This is a common and faithful formalization; the extra global definition doesn’t change the local statement since all conclusions and hypotheses are localized to U and p, and injectivity is asserted only on V ⊆ U.
- Additional hypothesis: Lean explicitly includes HasDerivAt f f' p rather than deriving it from holomorphicity; this is consistent and does not weaken/alter the intended meaning. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only standard Mathlib notions appear. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the auditing task.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- imports/open: Using Mathlib with Metric and Set notations.
- Theorem `zeros_of_analytic_are_isolated`:
  Hypotheses: U is an open subset of ℂ; f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic on U; c ∈ ℂ.
  Statement: For every z ∈ U with f(z) = c, there exists δ > 0 such that the open ball B(z, δ) meets the set {w ∈ U | f(w) = c} only at z; i.e., B(z, δ) ∩ {w | w ∈ U ∧ f w = c} = {z}.
  Interpretation: Each solution z of f(z)=c in U is isolated within U; hence {z ∈ U | f(z)=c} is a discrete subset (relative to U).

- Theorem `analytic_local_factorization`:
  Hypotheses: U is open; f is analytic on U; p ∈ U; f(p) = c.
  Conclusion: There exist a natural number k, a radius δ > 0, and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that g is analytic on the open ball B(p, δ), for all z ∈ B(p, δ) we have f(z) − c = (z − p)^k * g(z), and g(p) ≠ 0.
  Interpretation: Local Weierstrass-type factorization of f(z) − c at p: f(z) − c factors as (z − p)^k times a holomorphic function g which is nonvanishing at p. Note that g(p) ≠ 0 implies g is not identically zero.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First part (discreteness): The Lean theorem states precisely that each point z with f(z) = c is isolated in the relative topology of U, which is the standard definition that the zero set inside U is discrete. This matches the NL statement ""{ z ∈ U : f(z)=c } is a discrete set."" No additional extraneous or missing hypotheses (e.g., nonconstancy) are included; the Lean statement is faithful to the given NL phrasing.
- Second part (local factorization): The Lean theorem matches the requested factorization: existence of k ∈ ℕ, δ > 0, and holomorphic g on a disc such that f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z) for all z in the disc and g(p) ≠ 0. The NL also says ""g is not identically zero""; Lean does not state this separately, but g(p) ≠ 0 implies it, so the Lean statement is at least as strong. The Lean g is defined on ℂ but only asserted analytic on the ball, which is a standard formalization of ""g : Δ_δ(p) → ℂ"".

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain of f: NL has f : U → ℂ; Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ with AnalyticOn ℂ f U. This is a common formalization and does not change the intended meaning, since properties and equalities are only asserted on (or can be chosen to be within) the ball around p.
- Explicit inclusion of the ball in U: The NL statement implicitly requires Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U so that f(z) is defined. The Lean statement does not require this but quantifies equality for all z in the ball. Because f is globally defined in Lean, the statement is meaningful and can be satisfied by choosing δ small enough that B(p, δ) ⊆ U; hence this is not a substantive mismatch of meaning.
- Strength: Lean’s g(p) ≠ 0 implies ""g not identically zero"" as in the NL statement. The quantifier ""k is fixed"" is understood as the unique order at p; Lean’s existential k suffices.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully capture both parts of the NL statement. The only minor formalization difference is that f is globally defined and the ball is not explicitly stated to lie in U, but this does not change the mathematical content. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: U : Set ℂ and f : ℂ → ℂ. So f is a global function on ℂ, with properties assumed only on U. This is a standard way to formalize a function f : U → ℂ by restriction.

1) Theorem open_map_of_differentiable_nonconstant:
- Hypotheses: hU : IsOpen U (U is open), hconn : IsConnected U (U is connected), hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (f is holomorphic on U), hnc : ¬ ∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c (f is not constant on U).
- Conclusion: IsOpen (f '' U) (the image f(U) is open in ℂ).
This matches the open mapping theorem in the stated context (open, connected domain; holomorphic, nonconstant f).

2) Theorem locally_injective_of_deriv_ne_zero:
- Hypotheses: p ∈ U, U open, f holomorphic on U, and deriv f p ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ Set.InjOn f V.
This states that there is an open neighborhood V of p on which f is injective, i.e., f is locally injective at p when f'(p) ≠ 0. Using the usual mathlib convention, deriv f p ≠ 0 implies differentiability at p (since deriv defaults to 0 when not differentiable), which aligns with the Inverse Function Theorem intuition in the complex setting.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- First part: “Suppose U is open and connected, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f(U) is open.” The Lean theorem exactly matches this: open + connected + holomorphic on U + nonconstant on U ⇒ f '' U is open.
- Second part: “f is locally injective at all points where f'(p) ≠ 0.” The Lean theorem asserts local injectivity at any p ∈ U with deriv f p ≠ 0, under U open and f holomorphic on U. This is precisely the content, and even somewhat stronger in that it does not assume connectedness or non-constancy, which the NL statement does not require for this part anyway.

Minor nuance:
- The Lean local injectivity conclusion does not explicitly require V ⊆ U. In the natural language, since f : U → ℂ, the neighborhood is typically taken inside U. However, from the Lean conclusion one can take V ∩ U, which is open, contains p, and preserves InjOn f by restriction, so the intended “local injectivity in U” follows immediately. Thus the Lean statement is slightly stronger but implies the original claim.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms use standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsConnected, DifferentiableOn, deriv, InjOn). Proofs are omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions.

Final check:
- The Lean code faithfully translates the two conclusions of the natural language statement under appropriate hypotheses. The only slight difference is that the local injectivity theorem does not constrain the neighborhood to lie in U, but this strengthens the claim and still implies the intended formulation. Therefore the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context sets U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, z0 : ℂ, with hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
  - hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U — f is holomorphic (analytic) on U.
  - hz0 : z0 ∈ U — z0 is a point of U.
  - h_nonconst : ¬ ∀ z ∈ U, f z = f z0 — f is not constant on U (specifically, not identically equal to its value at z0, which is equivalent to non-constancy).
  - hder0 : deriv f z0 = 0 — f'(z0) = 0.
- Conclusion: There exist a natural number n, a radius r > 0, and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that:
  - 0 < r — a positive radius.
  - ball z0 r ⊆ U — the open ball around z0 of radius r lies within U.
  - AnalyticOn ℂ g (ball z0 r) — g is holomorphic (analytic) on that ball.
  - g z0 ≠ 0 — g does not vanish at z0.
  - ∀ z ∈ ball z0 r, deriv f z = (z - z0)^n * g z — on the ball, f' factors as (z - z0)^n times a holomorphic function nonvanishing at z0.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f not constant, f'(z0)=0. Show that z0 is a zero of f' of some finite order.
- Modeling domain: Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with AnalyticOn ℂ f U rather than f : U → ℂ holomorphic. This is standard in mathlib and fully faithful to “holomorphic on U”.
- Non-constancy: h_nonconst is exactly the condition that f is not constant on U.
- Derivative vanishes at z0: hder0 matches f'(z0) = 0.
- Conclusion: The existence of n, r, g with g analytic on a neighborhood, g(z0) ≠ 0, and f' = (z - z0)^n g on that neighborhood is the usual definition/characterization of “f' has a zero of order n at z0”. The code does not explicitly require n ≥ 1, but this is forced by hder0 together with g z0 ≠ 0: substituting z=z0 would give 0 = (0)^n * g(z0), which is only possible if n ≥ 1 since (0)^0 = 1 in mathlib, and g(z0) ≠ 0.
- The equality holds on a ball around z0, as required to express the local factorization (zero of finite order) of f'.

Checks for red flags:
- No placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (IsOpen, AnalyticOn, deriv, ball) are standard mathlib.
- No auxiliary definitions; just a single lemma with a sorry-proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- The conclusion captures exactly the finite order zero property. It does not insist that n be the minimal order, but the natural-language claim only asks for existence of some finite order, not identification of the minimal one, so this is faithful.

Final comparison:
- The mathematical content of the Lean statement matches the natural language statement precisely. Any subtlety about n ≥ 1 is implied by the given constraints. The difference in how the domain is modeled (f : ℂ → ℂ with AnalyticOn vs f : U → ℂ holomorphic) is standard and faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Metric`: Standard imports/open directives.
- Comment explains intent: they are expressing a weakened version of the classical statement: on an open set U, a complex-differentiable function has at each point a formal power series expansion (HasFPowerSeriesAt), and they only assert a nonzero radius.
- The theorem statement:
  - Hypotheses: `U : Set ℂ`, `hU : IsOpen U` (U is open), `f : ℂ → ℂ` (a globally defined function), `h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` (f is complex-differentiable on U).
  - Conclusion: For all `z ∈ U`, there exists a `p : FormalMultilinearSeries ℂ ℂ ℂ` such that `HasFPowerSeriesAt f p z ∧ p.radius ≠ 0`.
  - In words: At each point z in U, f has a formal power series expansion around z (in the Mathlib sense of HasFPowerSeriesAt), and the convergence radius of that series is strictly positive.

Notes on Mathlib notions:
- `HasFPowerSeriesAt f p z` entails that f equals the sum of the power series p in a neighborhood of z (so this does capture the “series sums to f” part locally).
- `p.radius ≠ 0` only asserts a positive radius of convergence, with no relation to any singularities.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original: U is a domain (open and connected), f : U → ℂ is holomorphic. Show f is analytic on U, meaning: for each point, f has a Taylor series expansion whose radius of convergence equals the distance to the nearest singularity, and the series sums to f.

Differences:
- Domain vs open: The code assumes only `IsOpen U`, not connectedness. So it does not encode “domain”.
- Function type: Original has `f : U → ℂ`; the code uses `f : ℂ → ℂ` with a `DifferentiableOn` hypothesis on U. While this can often be used to model a function defined on U, the statement is not phrased in terms of a function with domain U and ignores connectedness.
- Strength of analyticity claim: The code proves only the existence of a local power series with positive radius at each point (`p.radius ≠ 0`). It does not state that the radius equals the distance to the nearest singularity; it doesn’t even mention singularities or the boundary. This is a significant weakening of the original claim.
- Summation to f: While not stated explicitly, `HasFPowerSeriesAt` does include that the series sums to f in a neighborhood, so that part is captured implicitly.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
No. The Lean statement is strictly weaker in multiple ways:
- It drops connectedness (domain assumption).
- It changes the function type from `U → ℂ` to a global `ℂ → ℂ`.
- Crucially, it omits the core claim that the radius of convergence equals the distance to the nearest singularity; it only requires the radius to be nonzero. This is a major deviation from the original theorem.

Given these discrepancies, the code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

  - θtilde(b) = θtilde(a) + 2π if and only if `origin_inside` holds.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Given a piecewise smooth simple curve γ : [a, b] → ℂ \ {0} and a continuous θ with e^{iθ(t)} = γ(t)/|γ(t)|, there exists a continuous lift ˜θ with ˜θ(a) = θ(a), and moreover ˜θ(b) = ˜θ(a) + 2π if and only if the origin is inside the region bounded by γ.
- Matches:
  - γ avoids 0 is enforced (`hnonzero`).
  - Simplicity is attempted via injectivity off the endpoints (`hinj`).
  - θ is continuous and satisfies the exponential identity (`hθ`, `heq`).
  - The conclusion about existence of θtilde with the same exponential identity and θtilde(a) = θ(a) is present.
- Mismatches / Issues:
  - The critical predicate “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ” is not defined. Instead, the theorem takes an arbitrary `origin_inside : Prop` and asserts an equivalence with it. This is a vacuous placeholder not tied to γ or any geometric meaning. This fails the core of the statement.
  - The hypothesis “piecewise smooth” is replaced by mere continuity (`ContinuousOn`). This changes the assumptions and is not faithful.
  - The code treats γ as ℝ → ℂ and restricts to [a, b] via `ContinuousOn`; that is acceptable, but it does not encode the codomain ℂ \ {0} directly, only via a separate hypothesis.
  - Orientation issues aside, the intended iff in the problem is with a concrete, mathematically defined notion (inside the region bounded by γ), not an arbitrary Prop.

3) Final check: are the two statements the same?
- No. The central geometric condition is replaced by an arbitrary placeholder `origin_inside : Prop`. This is a major faithfulness failure per the guidelines (vacuous/placeholder auxiliary content). Additionally, the regularity hypothesis (piecewise smooth) is weakened to continuity.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language
- The ambient space is (Fin n → ℝ), which represents ℝ^n in Mathlib.
- Inputs:
  - n : ℕ
  - U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)
  - f : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) (a globally defined function on ℝ^n)
  - p : Fin n → ℝ
  - hU : IsOpen U (U is open)
  - hp : p ∈ U (p is in U)
  - hf : Prop (a placeholder proposition intended to stand for “f is C¹ on U”)
  - hDf_invertible : Prop (a placeholder proposition intended to stand for “Df at p is invertible”)
- Conclusion (existential): There exist sets V, W ⊆ ℝ^n such that
  - p ∈ V
  - V ⊆ U
  - f '' V = W (W is exactly f(V))
  - Injectivity: ∀ x y, if x ∈ V and y ∈ V and f x = f y then x = y
  - Existence of a function g : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) (note: global function, not explicitly restricted to W) such that
    - ∀ y ∈ W, g y ∈ V and f (g y) = y (g is a right inverse on W landing in V)
    - ∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x (g is a left inverse for f on V)
    - ∧ True (a vacuous placeholder, presumably intended to encode regularity like C¹ and the derivative identity)
- The proof is left as `by sorry`.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The original statement (Inverse Function Theorem on ℝ^n) requires:
- U ⊆ ℝ^n is open; f : U → ℝ^n is C¹; p ∈ U; Df|_p invertible (det ≠ 0).
- There exist open sets V, W such that p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, f|_V is injective, and there exists g : W → V with g = (f|_V)^{-1}.
- Furthermore, g is C¹ and Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1} for y = f(x).

Discrepancies and red flags in the Lean code:
- The key analytic hypotheses are replaced with arbitrary placeholders `hf : Prop` and `hDf_invertible : Prop` that are not specified or used. This is a vacuous stand-in, not a faithful encoding of “f is C¹ on U” and “Df|_p invertible”.
- The conclusions about regularity are missing: instead of asserting “g is continuously differentiable” and the derivative identity Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1}, the code merely appends `∧ True`, which is completely vacuous.
- The openness of V and W is not asserted. The original requires both V and W to be open.
- The function g is declared as a global function (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) rather than g : W → V; while this can be acceptable if properties are restricted to W and V, the code does not assert g is C¹ on W nor the derivative identity, so the essential differentiability content is absent.
- f is modeled as a global function on ℝ^n rather than f : U → ℝ^n. This can be fine if conclusions are restricted to V ⊆ U (which they are), but by itself does not harm faithfulness. The major issues are the missing openness and differentiability content and the placeholder hypotheses.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement omits crucial parts: openness of V and W, C¹-ness of f on U as a real hypothesis, C¹-ness of g, and the derivative identity for g. It uses vacuous placeholders for both hypotheses and one of the conclusions, which fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions/hypotheses be legitimate and faithful. Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale
- The code captures some of the topological/injective/inverse structure (existence of V, W with f '' V = W, injectivity on V, and a partial inverse g). However, it uses vacuous placeholders for the analytic hypotheses and conclusions, and omits the openness of V and W. According to the rubric, this fits: makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, then the final theorem/definition could be faithful. Hence a grade around 6 is appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem assumes: U ⊆ ℂ is open (hU : IsOpen U); f : ℂ → ℂ; f is complex-differentiable on U (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U); p ∈ U (hp : p ∈ U); f has a (global) complex derivative at p equal to deriv f p (hder : HasDerivAt f (deriv f p) p); and that derivative is nonzero (hder_ne : deriv f p ≠ 0).
- Conclusion: There exist sets V, W ⊆ ℂ such that V and W are open, p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, f '' V = W, and Function.Injective (fun x => f x) (i.e., f is globally injective on all of ℂ), and there exists g : ℂ → ℂ with g complex-differentiable on W and satisfying g (f x) = x for all x ∈ V and f (g y) = y for all y ∈ W.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U open in ℂ; f : U → ℂ holomorphic; f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exist open V, W ⊆ ℂ with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, and the restriction f|_V is injective with a holomorphic inverse.
- Matching parts:
  - U is open, f is holomorphic on U: represented by IsOpen U and DifferentiableOn ℂ f U.
  - p ∈ U and f'(p) ≠ 0: represented by hp and hder_ne (together with hder). Using deriv f p presupposes differentiability at p (which follows from open U and DifferentiableOn, so this is a redundant but acceptable strengthening of assumptions).
  - Existence of open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U and f(V) = W: represented by IsOpen V, IsOpen W, p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f '' V = W.
  - Existence of a holomorphic inverse g on W with two-sided inverse properties: represented by ∃ g, DifferentiableOn ℂ g W, and the identities g (f x) = x (for x ∈ V) and f (g y) = y (for y ∈ W).
- Critical mismatch:
  - The code asserts Function.Injective (fun x => f x), i.e., f is injective on all of ℂ. The natural statement only requires that the restriction f|_V is injective (injective on V). In Lean, the correct formalization should be Set.InjOn f V (or equivalently injectivity of f ∘ inclusion on V). Requiring global injectivity is much stronger and generally false; thus the Lean statement does not faithfully capture the natural language statement.
- Minor observations:
  - Having HasDerivAt f (deriv f p) p in the hypotheses is stronger than necessary, but not in conflict with the intended statement.
  - The inverse properties given for g are appropriate to express that g is the holomorphic inverse on W of f|_V.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are not the same because the Lean code demands global injectivity of f, rather than injectivity of f restricted to V. This is a substantive and incorrect strengthening of the conclusion, so the translation fails.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, p : ℂ.
- Assumptions:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
  - hconn : IsConnected U — U is connected.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U — f is holomorphic on U (complex differentiable on U).
  - hnon : ∃ z ∈ U, f z ≠ f p — there exists z in U such that f z ≠ f p; together with hp this implies f is nonconstant on U.
  - hp : p ∈ U — p is in U.
- Conclusion:
  - ∃ δ > 0, Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U ∧ IsOpenMap (fun z : {z : ℂ // z ∈ Metric.ball p δ \ {p}} => f z.val)
  - There exists δ > 0 such that the open ball around p of radius δ is contained in U and the restriction of f to the punctured disk (as a subtype domain) is an open map.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: If U ⊆ ℂ is open and connected, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant, and p ∈ U, then there exists δ > 0 such that f restricted to Δ_δ(p) \ {p} is an open map.
- The Lean version encodes holomorphicity as DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, and models restriction by considering the function from the subtype { z ∈ ℂ | z ∈ ball(p, δ) \ {p} } to ℂ given by z ↦ f z.val, and asserts IsOpenMap for that function. This is the standard Mathlib way to express that the restriction is an open map.
- The hypothesis “nonconstant” is expressed as ∃ z ∈ U, f z ≠ f p, combined with hp : p ∈ U. This is logically equivalent to nonconstancy on U (since it gives two points p, z ∈ U with different values). Conversely, nonconstant implies such a z exists for any chosen p ∈ U, so this matches the intended assumption.
- The inclusion Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U is an explicit formalization of the implicit requirement that the punctured disk lies in the domain U of f. This is necessary because in Lean f is ℂ → ℂ and we want the restriction to a subset contained in U; it aligns with the intended meaning.
- Using IsOpenMap on the subtype is exactly the correct Mathlib formulation of “the restriction is an open map”.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are made; there are no auxiliary defs. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsConnected, DifferentiableOn, IsOpenMap, Metric.ball).

Final check:
- Hypotheses and conclusion match the NL statement in mathematical meaning. The added inclusion ball ⊆ U is the formal counterpart of restricting to a disk around p inside U. The expression of nonconstant via f z ≠ f p is equivalent given p ∈ U. The domain of the restricted function is precisely the punctured disk. Therefore the translation is faithful.

- `Tendsto f (cocompact ℂ) (nhds L) ↔` This states that f tends to L along the cocompact filter on ℂ. In ℂ, the cocompact filter corresponds to approaching infinity in the one-point compactification (Riemann sphere) sense: neighborhoods of ∞ are complements of compact sets.

- `by sorry`: proof omitted (allowed in this auditing task).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The left side exactly formalizes “lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere” as `Tendsto f (cocompact ℂ) (nhds L)`, since the cocompact filter on ℂ corresponds to neighborhoods of ∞ in the one-point compactification.
- The right side matches “for every ε>0 there exists M such that |f(z)−L|<ε whenever |z|>M.” It uses `dist z 0` for |z| and `dist (f z) L` for |f(z)−L|, which is standard in Mathlib.
- The use of strict `>` is exactly as in the natural statement (“whenever |z| > M”).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- No auxiliary definitions appear.
- The equivalence is stated exactly as an “iff.”
- The interpretation of “Riemann sphere” via the cocompact filter on ℂ is correct.
- Using ℂ specifically (a proper, locally compact metric space) justifies reduction to complements of closed balls, aligning with the M-criterion.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Context: U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. This matches “Let U ⊂ ℂ be open.”
- Goal: ∃ (K : ℕ → Set ℂ), ... A sequence (indexed by ℕ) of sets K n.
- Condition 1: (∀ n, IsCompact (K n) ∧ K n ⊆ U). Each K n is compact and a subset of U. This matches “a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U.”
- Condition 2: (∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))). For all n, K_n is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}. This matches “K_n ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘”. The use of ⊆ corresponds to the usual mathematical convention where ⊂ can mean subset (not necessarily strict); even if strictness was intended, in this context it typically isn’t essential, and the rest of the conditions suggest proper containment anyway.
- Condition 3: (U = ⋃ n, interior (K n)). U equals the union over n of the interiors of K n. This matches “U = ⋃_{n=1}^∞ K_n^∘” (index shift from 1 to 0 is immaterial since existence is being asserted).
- Condition 4: (∀ n, ∃ (F : Finset (ℂ × ℝ)), K n ⊆ (⋃ p ∈ F, Metric.closedBall p.1 p.2) ∧ (⋃ p ∈ F, Metric.closedBall p.1 p.2) ⊆ interior (K (n+1))). For each n, there exists a finite collection F of pairs (center, radius) so that the union of the corresponding closed balls covers K n and is contained in the interior of K n+1. In ℂ with the Euclidean metric, Metric.closedBall are exactly closed disks. The finiteness is encoded by Finset. The double inclusion matches “K_n ⊆ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊆ K_{n+1}^∘”. There is no requirement that radii be nonnegative, but since dist ≥ 0, closedBall with negative radius is empty and can be dropped; hence the existential statement is equivalent to one with radii ≥ 0 (so this matches the intended notion of closed disks).

Step 2: Whole-statement faithfulness
- The code asserts existence of a sequence of compact subsets of U with the nesting K_n ⊆ interior K_{n+1}, whose interiors exhaust U, and for each n a finite union of closed disks sandwiched between K_n and interior K_{n+1}. This is exactly the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Indexing from ℕ versus starting at 1: immaterial for an existence statement.
- ⊆ vs ⊂: In common mathematical usage, ⊂ is often used for subset-equal; even if strictness was intended, the rest of the conditions make the intended exhaustion clear, and the translation is standard.
- Radii unrestricted in Lean: existentially equivalent, since negative radii yield empty balls and can be omitted; hence no change in meaning.
- All constructs are standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsCompact, interior, Metric.closedBall, Finset, unions). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `∃ (K : ℕ → Set ℂ),` there exists a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of sets K n.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n))` each K n is compact (as a subset of ℂ).
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))` for each n, K n is contained in the interior of K (n+1).
- `U = (⋃ n : ℕ, interior (K n))` U is the union of the interiors of the K n.

Here `Metric.closedBall p.fst p.snd` is the closed ball in ℂ (a closed disk), and the union `⋃ p ∈ s` is a finite union because s is a Finset.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL: U ⊂ ℂ open. Matches `U : Set ℂ` with `hU : IsOpen U`.
- NL: There exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U. Lean states K n are compact, and from the other conditions we can deduce K n ⊆ U: since U = ⋃ interior(K n), each interior(K n) ⊆ U; then K n ⊆ interior(K (n+1)) ⊆ U, so indeed K n ⊆ U. So this matches “compact subsets of U.”
- NL: K_n ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘. Lean: K n ⊆ interior(K (n+1)). Same condition (⊂ is commonly used as ⊆ in such contexts; strictness is not essential and not required by the statement).
- NL: U = ⋃ K_n^∘. Lean: U = ⋃ (interior (K n)). Exact match. The indexing in Lean is over ℕ (starting at 0) rather than n ≥ 1, which is immaterial for an existence statement.
- NL: For each n, there exists a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊂ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘. Lean: For each n, ∃ finite set s of centers and radii such that K n ⊆ ⋃_{p∈s} closedBall(p.fst, p.snd) ⊆ interior(K (n+1)). This is exactly a finite union of closed disks containing K_n and contained in the interior of K_{n+1}. Allowing any real radius is fine since existence lets us pick nonnegative radii; the formulation precisely captures “finite collection of closed disks.”

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not explicitly state K n ⊆ U, but it follows from the other clauses, so the meaning is preserved.
- Indexing starts at 0 in Lean vs 1 in the NL statement; this is a harmless convention difference for existence.
- The subset symbols are non-strict in Lean; the NL uses ⊂ but standard usage in such statements is non-strict containment, and even if strictness were intended, the existence result does not rely on strictness. The intended content is preserved.
- All notions are standard Mathlib ones (IsCompact, interior, finite unions over Finset, Metric.closedBall). There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

Formally, this means: given conditional convergence, the series is not absolutely convergent, i.e., Σ |a_n| does not converge. The Lean theorem formalizes precisely this implication. The auxiliary definition of conditional convergence matches the standard one.

3) Final check:
- Domain: real series (ℝ), consistent with the usual interpretation.
- No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition uses genuine Mathlib `Summable`. No fake definitions like `:= True`.
- The theorem statement exactly captures the intended rigorous content of the informal phrase “do not tend to zero fast enough to ensure absolute convergence,” namely ¬ Summable |a|. There is no mismatch or extraneous assumptions.
Thus the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MeasureTheory Set` just bring in Mathlib and open relevant namespaces; no mathematical content.
- `lemma outer_measure_union_null {α : Type _} (μ : MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure α) {A B : Set α} (h : μ.measureOf B = 0) : μ.measureOf (A ∪ B) = μ.measureOf A := by sorry`
  This states: For any type α, any outer measure μ on α, and any sets A, B ⊆ α, if μ(B) = 0, then μ(A ∪ B) = μ(A). Here `μ.measureOf` is the outer measure function on sets (coercible to `μ s`), valued in ℝ≥∞.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let m* be the (Lebesgue) outer measure on ℝ^n. If A, B ⊆ ℝ^n with m*(B) = 0, then m*(A ∪ B) = m*(A).
- The Lean statement is a generalization: it asserts the same property for an arbitrary outer measure on an arbitrary type α. This is stronger and in particular applies to the specific case of the Lebesgue outer measure on ℝ^n, so it faithfully captures (and generalizes) the intended statement.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a single lemma statement with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable per the instructions.
- All terminology uses Mathlib's standard `OuterMeasure` and its evaluation on sets.

Final check:
- Both statements assert: union with a μ-null set does not change the outer measure of a set. The Lean version is the same property in a more general setting; there is no mismatch in quantifiers or concepts.
- Hence the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `variable {f : Complex → Complex} {L : Complex}`: We are working with a function f: ℂ → ℂ and a complex number L ∈ ℂ.
- `def tendsto_in_riemann_at_infty (f : Complex → Complex) (L : Complex) : Prop := ∀ U : Set Complex, IsOpen U → L ∈ U → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : Complex, Complex.abs z > M → f z ∈ U`
  Translation: Define “f tends to L at infinity (in the Riemann sphere sense)” to mean: for every open set U ⊆ ℂ with L ∈ U, there exists a real number M such that for all z ∈ ℂ, if |z| > M then f(z) ∈ U. This captures the notion of z → ∞ in the one-point compactification (Riemann sphere) where neighborhoods of ∞ are complements of large compact sets, here represented by |z| > M.
- `theorem limit_at_infty_riemann_iff_epsilon ... : tendsto_in_riemann_at_infty f L ↔ (∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : Complex, Complex.abs z > M → Complex.abs (f z - L) < ε) := by sorry`
  Translation: The limit at infinity in the above topological (Riemann sphere) sense is equivalent to the epsilon characterization: for every ε > 0, there exists M such that for all z with |z| > M, we have |f(z) − L| < ε.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: For L ∈ ℂ, show lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the Riemann sphere sense if and only if for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M.
- The code’s definition of the Riemann sphere sense for lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L uses open neighborhoods of L in ℂ and a neighborhood base at ∞ given by sets {z : |z| > M}. This is exactly the standard topological definition, and since L is finite, neighborhoods of L in the Riemann sphere coincide with usual open subsets of ℂ near L. The epsilon formulation is exactly as in the statement. Thus the equivalence theorem precisely formalizes the intended claim.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain/codomain: Both treat f: ℂ → ℂ and L ∈ ℂ; matches the given assumption “Suppose L ∈ ℂ.”
- The Riemann sphere sense: Correctly modeled by neighborhoods of ∞ in the domain as |z| > M; no mismatch.
- Epsilon statement: Matches exactly.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the auxiliary definition is substantive and faithful. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the task requires translation faithfulness, not proof.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- Completely different. The Lean code neither states nor encodes any part of the analytic continuation/Taylor series statement. There are no auxiliary definitions pretending to be about holomorphicity; it's simply a reflexivity lemma.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_1436 (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ) :` introduces a function f: ℂ → ℂ and a point z0 ∈ ℂ.
- `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) (atTop : Filter ℝ) ↔` asserts that the following are equivalent:
  Left side: the function z ↦ ‖f z‖ tends to +∞ (atTop) as z → z0 along the neighborhood filter `nhds z0`.
- `∀ M : ℝ, 0 < M → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z : ℂ, ‖z - z0‖ < δ → ‖f z‖ > M` is the epsilon–delta style formulation: for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with ‖z − z0‖ < δ, one has ‖f z‖ > M.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff ∀ M > 0 ∃ δ > 0, |f(z)| > M whenever |z − z0| < δ.” Mathematically, “in the sense of the Riemann sphere” means the extended complex limit at ∞, which is equivalent to |f(z)| → +∞ as z → z0, but crucially the notion of limit as z → z0 must ignore the value at z0 itself (punctured neighborhoods). The standard correct formalization uses the punctured filter 𝓝[≠] z0, and the epsilon–delta condition should read 0 < |z − z0| < δ.

- The Lean code uses `(nhds z0)` instead of `𝓝[≠] z0`. This includes z0 itself. For a real-valued target going to atTop, `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) atTop` forces ‖f z0‖ ≥ M for all M, which is impossible for finite ‖f z0‖. Thus the left side is generally false unless f z0 is “infinite,” which cannot happen with f : ℂ → ℂ. So this does not match the intended notion of limit as z → z0 (punctured).

- Similarly, the right-hand side quantifies over all z with ‖z − z0‖ < δ, not excluding z = z0. This again forces ‖f z0‖ > M for all M, impossible. The correct form should require 0 < ‖z − z0‖ < δ (or quantify over punctured neighborhoods).

- The NL statement also explicitly references the Riemann sphere (extended complex numbers). The Lean statement avoids ℂ∞ and instead uses the equivalent characterization via norms tending to +∞, which is acceptable in principle, but only if the limit is taken along punctured neighborhoods. Using `nhds z0` makes it non-equivalent to the intended extended-complex limit.

Final comparison:
- Difference 1: Filter at the point vs punctured filter. Lean uses `nhds z0` instead of `𝓝[≠] z0`, changing the meaning substantially and making the statement generally false.
- Difference 2: The epsilon–delta condition includes z0; it should exclude z0 (0 < ‖z − z0‖ < δ).
- Difference 3: The NL statement invokes Riemann sphere semantics; while the norm-to-atTop approach is fine as an equivalent, it must be paired with the punctured filter to be faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It is very close structurally but misses the crucial exclusion of z0 on both sides, which is essential for the intended meaning.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- It declares f : ℂ → ℂ and z0 : ℂ.
- The theorem states: Filter.Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) atTop ↔ ∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, ‖z - z0‖ < δ → ‖f z‖ > M.
  In words: The norm of f tends to +∞ along the (non-punctured) neighborhood filter at z0 if and only if for every M>0 there exists δ>0 such that whenever ‖z−z0‖<δ we have ‖f z‖>M.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The NL statement is: lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every M>0 there exists δ>0 such that |f(z)|>M whenever |z−z0|<δ.

Key issues:
1) Riemann sphere vs norm: The NL LHS speaks about the limit of f in the Riemann sphere equaling ∞. The code’s LHS is instead the real-valued limit Filter.Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) … atTop. While mathematically these are equivalent, the code does not include or reference f tending to the point at infinity in the Riemann sphere (e.g., via OnePoint/ RiemannSphere or an equivalence lemma). It proves only “norm tends to atTop ↔ δ-condition,” not “Riemann sphere limit ↔ δ-condition.” This is a mismatch in formalization relative to the stated object.

2) Punctured vs non-punctured neighborhoods: Limits as z→z0 (in standard analysis and in the Riemann sphere sense) are taken along punctured neighborhoods (z ≠ z0). The correct filter is nhdsWithin z0 {z | z ≠ z0}. The code uses nhds z0, and the δ-condition uses ‖z−z0‖<δ without excluding z=z0. As written, both sides of the code’s equivalence are impossible unless f z0 has infinite norm (which cannot happen in ℂ), so the statement is not the usual notion of tending to ∞. The NL statement, although it writes “|z−z0|<δ,” typically intends 0<|z−z0|<δ; together with “in the sense of the Riemann sphere,” this strongly suggests punctured neighborhoods are intended. The code fails to reflect this.

3) Scope: There are no auxiliary definitions; that is good. However, the theorem does not formalize the Riemann sphere at all, which is explicitly part of the NL statement.

Step 3: Verdict.
- Because the code replaces the Riemann sphere limit by a norm-to-∞ statement without formalizing their equivalence, and it uses non-punctured neighborhoods (nhds z0) rather than punctured ones, it is not a faithful formalization of the given statement. Even if we overlook the Riemann sphere modeling, the missing punctured condition is a serious mismatch with the standard meaning of the NL statement.

Grade rationale: Significant conceptual mismatch (Riemann sphere not formalized) and a crucial technical mismatch (nhds vs nhdsWithin) warrant a low score. No vacuous defs are present, so not the lowest. Hence 4.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: a, b : ℝ; U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. f : ℂ → ℂ, with hfd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (i.e., f is complex-differentiable/holomorphic on U), and hfnc : ¬ ∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c (i.e., f is nonconstant on U). α : ℝ → ℂ with hα : DifferentiableOn ℝ α (Icc a b), and hα' : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, deriv α t ≠ 0 (the real derivative α'(t) exists and is nonzero on the whole closed interval), and hα_range : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, α t ∈ U (the curve stays in U).
- Claim: StrictMonoOn (fun t => Complex.arg (f (α t))) (Icc a b) ↔ (∃ θ, ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, Complex.arg (deriv f (α t) * deriv α t) = θ).
  • Left side: the function t ↦ Complex.arg(f(α t)) is strictly monotone increasing on [a,b] (StrictMonoOn in Lean means strictly increasing) using the principal branch Complex.arg : ℂ → ℝ.
  • Right side: there exists a real θ such that for all t ∈ [a,b], Complex.arg((deriv f at α t) * (deriv α at t)) = θ. Here deriv f (α t) is the complex derivative of f at α t; deriv α t is the real derivative of α at t; their product is the derivative of the composition, and we take its principal argument.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: U open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant; α : [a,b] → U smooth with α'(t) ≠ 0 for all t ∈ [a,b]. Then f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a,b] iff arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) is constant.

Matches:
- U open, f holomorphic on U and nonconstant: encoded as IsOpen U, DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, and ¬∃c, ∀z∈U, f z = c (nonconstant on U). Using f : ℂ → ℂ but restricting to U is standard and acceptable for a translation.
- α : [a,b] → U is differentiable with α'(t) ≠ 0 and α(t) ∈ U: captured by DifferentiableOn ℝ α (Icc a b), hα', and hα_range.
- Right-hand condition uses arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) constant: matches via Complex.arg (deriv f (α t) * deriv α t) = θ.

Key mismatches/problems:
1) Strictly increasing vs strictly monotonic (either direction): The code uses StrictMonoOn, which means strictly increasing only. The English phrase ""changes argument strictly monotonically"" typically means strictly monotone (either increasing or decreasing). The code omits the strictly decreasing possibility (StrictAntiOn). This is a significant mismatch.
2) Definition of arg at zero and domain issues: Mathlib’s Complex.arg is total (gives 0 at 0), so the code allows f(α(t)) = 0 or (f'(α(t)) α'(t)) = 0, still talking about arg. In standard complex analysis, arg is not defined at 0, and the statement implicitly requires the quantities whose arg is taken to be nonzero or uses a continuous branch along the curve. The code neither assumes f(α(t)) ≠ 0 nor (f'(α(t)) α'(t)) ≠ 0, so it may assert monotonicity/constancy of arg at points where arg is classically undefined. This is a substantial mismatch with the intended statement.
3) Branch/continuity of argument: The code uses the principal value Complex.arg, not any continuous lifting of the argument along the path. The natural language ""changes argument strictly monotonically"" may refer to the continuous argument along the curve (which can increase beyond π), whereas principal arg is bounded in (−π, π] and may have jump discontinuities. The code fixes a specific branch and therefore may fail to reflect the intended notion.
4) Smoothness vs differentiability: The NL says α is ""smooth"" (often meaning C^∞), while the code assumes only DifferentiableOn on [a,b]. This is weaker. While the theorem would not need more than C^1, as a translation it does not match the stated hypothesis exactly.
5) Endpoint differentiability: hα is DifferentiableOn on Icc, which in mathlib is a within-derivative notion at endpoints, whereas the code uses deriv α t (ambient derivative) for all t ∈ Icc. This mixes notions and may not reflect the intended one-sided derivative at endpoints in the NL statement.

Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean statement enforces strictly increasing principal argument on [a,b] and allows arg at zero, whereas the NL statement asserts strict monotonic change (likely either increasing or decreasing) of the argument of f∘α, with arg understood in the classical sense (undefined at zero, or via a continuous branch along the path). The mismatch on monotonic direction and the arg-at-zero/branch issues mean the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- The code captures the general form (open set, holomorphic nonconstant f, differentiable α with nonvanishing derivative, equivalence between monotonic argument and constant argument of the derivative product), but it diverges in critical technical aspects (strictly increasing vs strictly monotone, principal arg vs continuous argument/undefined-at-zero, endpoint derivative handling). These are nontrivial differences. Hence, not faithful; grade 7 reflects that it is close in shape but fails important details.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line into natural language.
- The theorem holomorphic_near_closed_unit_disk_taylor_approx takes as inputs:
  - f : ℂ → ℂ (a complex-valued function),
  - a : ℕ → ℂ (an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers),
  - h_analytic : Prop (an arbitrary proposition),
  - h0 : f 0 ≠ 0 (a nonvanishing condition at 0).
  It asserts: assuming h_analytic, there exists a real constant C such that for all natural m and all complex z with |z| ≤ 1, we have |1 − ∑_{k=0}^{m} a k · z^k| ≤ C · |z|^{m+1}.
  The sum is expressed as Finset.sum (range (m+1)) (fun k => a k * z^k), which is exactly ∑_{k=0}^{m} a(k) z^k.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- Original hypothesis: “f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk \overline{D}(0,1) and f(0) ≠ 0.” The code replaces this with an arbitrary predicate h_analytic : Prop that is not tied to f or to holomorphicity, and merely assumes h_analytic in the implication. This is a vacuous placeholder and not a faithful formalization of the holomorphicity-on-a-neighborhood condition.
- Original conclusion: There exists C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and |z| ≤ 1,
  |1 − ∑_{k=0}^{m} (f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0))) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.
  The code’s sum uses arbitrary coefficients a k with no relation to derivatives of f at 0 or the normalization by f(0) or k!. So the quantity in the code is |1 − ∑ a(k) z^k|, not the normalized Taylor partial sum dictated by the statement. There is no constraint that a encodes the Taylor coefficients of f/f(0). This changes the mathematical content substantially.
- Scope of quantifiers: The Lean statement quantifies over an arbitrary sequence a and asserts the inequality for that sequence, conditional only on h_analytic. The original statement fixes the specific coefficients given by the derivatives of f (normalized by f(0)), not an arbitrary sequence.
- The domain restriction |z| ≤ 1 matches, and the existence and uniformity of C over m and z is structurally similar (though the sign/positivity of C is not enforced, which is a minor issue).
- The nonvanishing condition h0 : f 0 ≠ 0 is present as a parameter but is not connected to anything else in the formal statement; it is unused in the inequality, and the coefficients in the code do not even reference f(0).

Step 3: Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The code:
  - uses a vacuous predicate h_analytic unrelated to f and the correct holomorphicity condition,
  - replaces the specific Taylor coefficients f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0)) with an arbitrary sequence a : ℕ → ℂ,
  - therefore asserts a statement that is not the same as the original (indeed, it is a very different and generally false/unsupported claim for arbitrary a).
- Hence the translation is not faithful.

Additional red flags per guidelines:
- Auxiliary placeholder h_analytic : Prop is vacuous and does not faithfully encode holomorphicity on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk.
- Missing use of Mathlib’s analytic/holomorphic predicates (e.g., AnalyticOn, IsOpen, closedBall 0 1 ⊆ U) and of Taylor/derivative constructs (higherDeriv/deriv^[k], factorial, etc.).
- The introduction of an arbitrary sequence a instead of tying it to the derivatives fundamentally changes the statement.

Grade rationale: Because the code introduces vacuous placeholders and, more importantly, universally quantifies over arbitrary coefficients a unrelated to f, the final theorem is not a faithful translation even if the placeholder for holomorphicity were fixed. This matches the rubric level “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.”

  Natural language: For any subset S of the metric space X, S is closed if and only if for every sequence u: ℕ → X and every point a in X, if all terms of the sequence lie in S and u converges to a in X (i.e., Tendsto u atTop (nhds a)), then a belongs to S.

2) Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: ""In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S.""
- The Lean statement precisely asserts: IsClosed S iff for all sequences u with values in S (expressed as ∀ n, u n ∈ S) and any a in X, if u → a (in X) then a ∈ S. This is exactly the notion that every convergent sequence in S has its limit in S.
- Using Filter.Tendsto u atTop (nhds a) is the standard Mathlib formalization of a sequence converging to a in X.
- Expressing “sequence in S” as u: ℕ → X with ∀ n, u n ∈ S is equivalent to u: ℕ → S.

3) Final check for differences or issues:
- Biconditional (↔) matches “iff.”
- Convergence “in X” is modeled by nhds a (the ambient topology), not a subspace topology—this matches the statement.
- The Lean version quantifies over all a and uses an implication “if u tends to a then a ∈ S.” This is equivalent to “if u converges (in X), its limit is in S,” since in metric spaces limits are unique (metric spaces are Hausdorff).
- No auxiliary/vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced. All concepts are standard Mathlib notions.
- Therefore the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] {R : Type*} [CommRing R]` sets up a finite index type `n` (so matrices are square of size n×n) and a commutative ring `R`. This is the standard setting for determinants in Mathlib.
- `def perm_matrix (σ : Equiv.Perm n) : Matrix n n R := fun i j => if j = σ i then (1 : R) else 0` defines the permutation matrix associated to a permutation σ: in row i and column j the entry is 1 exactly when j = σ i, and 0 otherwise. This precisely matches the usual definition of a permutation matrix relative to the standard basis.
- `theorem det_perm_matrix_eq_neg_one_or_one (σ : Equiv.Perm n) : Matrix.det (perm_matrix σ) = (-1 : R) ∨ Matrix.det (perm_matrix σ) = (1 : R)` asserts that for the permutation matrix associated to any σ, its determinant is either −1 or 1 (as elements of R).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: “Let P be a permutation matrix. Prove that det(P) ∈ {−1,1}.” The code formalizes P as the permutation matrix coming from σ, which is exactly how permutation matrices are defined (one 1 per row/column at positions given by σ). So this matches the notion of “permutation matrix.”
- The conclusion uses a logical disjunction of equalities `det = -1 ∨ det = 1`, which is equivalent to `det ∈ {−1,1}`. This is faithful.
- The code works over an arbitrary commutative ring R. This is a standard generalization of the classical statement over fields and remains correct; it does not change the meaning of the claim (it strengthens it). The presence of char 2 where −1=1 does not invalidate the statement; the disjunction remains true.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `perm_matrix` is a real definition, not a stub, and no other auxiliary definitions are present. The proof is elided with `sorry`, which is acceptable for checking translation.
- The instruction “Do this without Laplace formula” pertains to proof method; since we are only auditing the statement, this is irrelevant here.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem exactly captures that the determinant of a permutation matrix is either −1 or 1. It is faithful to the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators` just bring in mathlib and notation for sums/products.
- The theorem `cauchy_product_abs_summable_of_a_abs_summable (a b : ℕ → ℝ)` concerns two real sequences `a` and `b` indexed by natural numbers (starting at 0).
- Hypotheses:
  - `ha : Summable (fun n => abs (a n))` means the series ∑ |a n| converges (absolute convergence of ∑ a_n).
  - `hb : Summable b` means the series ∑ b n converges (possibly conditionally).
- Conclusion:
  - `Summable (fun n => abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)))` means the series ∑_n |∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}| converges. In other words, the Cauchy product series c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} is absolutely summable.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions since we're auditing the statement.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show the Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely.”
- The Lean theorem states exactly: if `a` is absolutely summable and `b` is summable, then the Cauchy product coefficients `c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}` form an absolutely summable series, i.e., ∑ |c_n| converges.
- Minor indexing difference (NL starts at n=1; Lean uses ℕ starting at 0) is a harmless reindexing and does not change the mathematical content.
- The Lean file explicitly restricts to real sequences, which is a standard specialization and still faithful to the general statement.
- No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given.

Final check: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the NL statement (though the mathematical claim is in fact stronger than the classical Mertens result and false in general, this audit checks translation, not correctness). There are no mismatches in meaning between the two formulations.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Function`: Setup, fine.
- `variable (Analytic : (Complex → Complex) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate `Analytic` on functions `ℂ → ℂ`. This is not tied to Mathlib's notion of holomorphic/analytic (e.g., `AnalyticOn ℂ`, `Holomorphic`, `Differentiable ℂ`). It's an uninterpreted placeholder.
- The theorem:
  `theorem injective_analytic_is_conformal {f : Complex → Complex} (hf : Analytic f) (h_inj : Injective f) : ∃ g : Complex → Complex, (∀ z, g (f z) = z) ∧ Analytic g := by sorry`
  Natural language: Given a function `f : ℂ → ℂ` that satisfies the arbitrary predicate `Analytic` and is injective, there exists a function `g : ℂ → ℂ` such that `g ∘ f = id_ℂ` (i.e., for all z, g(f z) = z), and `g` itself satisfies the same arbitrary predicate `Analytic`.

2) Compare with the original mathematical statement:
- Original: If `f : ℂ → ℂ` is analytic (holomorphic) and injective, then `f` is conformal onto its image; i.e., `f` is a holomorphic bijection from `ℂ` onto `f(ℂ)` and the inverse `f^{-1} : f(ℂ) → ℂ` is holomorphic.
- Key points to represent:
  - Use of the standard notion of holomorphic/analytic from Mathlib (e.g., `Holomorphic`, `AnalyticOn ℂ univ f` or similar).
  - The inverse is defined on the image `f(ℂ)` (the range), not on all of `ℂ`.
  - Both directions of bijection onto the image are implicit: injectivity gives bijection onto `range f`, and the theorem must assert the inverse (as a function on `range f`) is holomorphic.

3) Mismatches and red flags:
- The code uses an arbitrary predicate `Analytic` as a variable, not Mathlib's holomorphic/analytic notion. This is a placeholder, not a faithful use of Mathlib terminology (Guideline 2). It makes the statement about any predicate, not specifically about holomorphicity.
- The existence of `g : ℂ → ℂ` with `g (f z) = z` for all `z` asserts a global left-inverse defined on all of `ℂ`. The original requires an inverse defined on `f(ℂ)` (the image), not on all of `ℂ`. The code's requirement is strictly stronger (and generally false unless `f` is surjective). Thus it does not match ""onto its image"".
- The code only asserts one-sided inverse property `g ∘ f = id` and does not express or encode that `f` is a bijection or that `f ∘ g` equals the identity on the image. The appropriate Lean formalization would typically involve `g : Set.range f → ℂ` (or a subtype domain) with the correct two-sided properties, and holomorphicity on that domain.
- The theorem's conclusion only claims `Analytic g` (again the arbitrary predicate), not that `g` is holomorphic in the Mathlib sense on the correct domain. It also does not state that `f` is a bijection onto its image; though injectivity guarantees bijection onto the image, the domain/codomain mismatch remains.

4) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is both using a non-standard placeholder predicate for analyticity and demands a global inverse `g : ℂ → ℂ` with `g ∘ f = id` (too strong and on the wrong codomain), whereas the natural language statement concerns a holomorphic inverse defined on the image `f(ℂ)`. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Given these issues, the code fails both by using a vacuous/placeholder predicate and by misstating the domain/codomain and inverse properties required. Even if the placeholder predicate were fixed to the correct Mathlib notion, the statement still would not match due to the inverse being defined on all of `ℂ` instead of on `f(ℂ)`.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X]`: Let X be a type equipped with a metric space structure and assume X is complete as a metric space.
- `theorem baire_category_metric (U : ℕ → Set X) (hU : ∀ n, IsOpen (U n) ∧ Dense (U n)) : Dense (⋂ n, U n) := by sorry`
  This states: For a sequence U indexed by natural numbers of subsets of X, if for every n, U n is open and dense in X, then the intersection over all n of U n is dense in X. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: Let (X,d) be a complete metric space. Let {U_n} be a sequence of open dense sets. Show that ⋂ U_n is dense.
- Lean: Exactly assumes X is a complete metric space, takes a sequence U : ℕ → Set X with each U n open and dense, and concludes that the intersection over n is dense.
- The Mathlib predicates used (IsOpen, Dense) correspond to the standard notions. The intersection notation (⋂ n, U n) is the countable intersection over ℕ.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. No mismatched hypotheses. The countable intersection matches the sequence. Completeness is assumed as required. The conclusion is exactly the density of the intersection. No extra or missing conditions.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions (`Summable`, `tsum`, `Finset.sum` with `Finset.range (n+1)`) and accurately encodes the Cauchy product `cₙ = ∑_{m=0}^n a_m b_{n-m}`.
- Absolute convergence is correctly expressed via `Summable (fun n => Complex.abs ...)` for complex sequences (in Mathlib, `‖z‖ = Complex.abs z`).
- The second conclusion matches “its sum equals the product of the sums.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; everything is standard Mathlib terminology.
- Specialization to complex-valued series is a standard setting and faithful to the common reading of the natural language theorem about series; it does not distort the statement.

- Variables: x : ℕ → ℝ and ℓ : ℝ. So we have a real sequence (x_n) and a real number ℓ.
- Theorem statement bounded_subseqs_same_limit_tendsto:
  - h_bdd: ∃ M, 0 ≤ M ∧ ∀ n, |x n| ≤ M. This says the sequence (x_n) is bounded in absolute value.
  - h_subseq: ∀ s : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono s → ∀ L : ℝ, Tendsto (x ∘ s) atTop (nhds L) → L = ℓ. For every subsequence (defined via a strictly increasing index map s), if that subsequence converges to some L, then necessarily L = ℓ; i.e., every convergent subsequence has limit ℓ.
  - Conclusion: Tendsto x atTop (nhds ℓ). The sequence x_n converges to ℓ as n → ∞.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: If {x_n} is bounded and every convergent subsequence has the same limit ℓ, then x_n → ℓ.
- Boundedness matches h_bdd.
- ""Every convergent subsequence has the same limit ℓ"" matches h_subseq exactly: for any subsequence, if it converges to some L, then L must equal ℓ.
- Conclusion x_n → ℓ matches Tendsto x atTop (nhds ℓ).

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.

- The encoding of subsequences via StrictMono s : ℕ → ℕ is standard and correct.
- The boundedness hypothesis includes 0 ≤ M, which is harmless and equivalent in this context.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language assumption: “X is a metric space such that every open cover of X has a finite subcover.” This is exactly `CompactSpace X` in Mathlib.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- open Set, variable {n : ℕ}: We work in the setting of sets and fix a natural number n.
- The theorem second_order_taylor_uniform_on_compact states:
  Given U : Set (Fin n → ℝ) and f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ, with hU : Convex ℝ U and hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (i.e., f is C^2 on U in the sense of Fréchet derivatives within U), then for every compact set K with K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K, and all v : Fin n → ℝ with ‖v‖ < δ and x + v ∈ U, we have the uniform second-order Taylor estimate:
  | f (x + v) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) v − (1/2) * (((fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x) v) v) | ≤ ε * ‖v‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the Fréchet derivative of f at x (a continuous linear map), and fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x is the second derivative represented as a linear map into linear maps; applying it twice to v yields the bilinear form (the Hessian) applied to (v, v). The condition x + v ∈ U ensures we only evaluate f where it is assumed to be C^2; convexity of U will be used (in a proof) to keep line segments inside U.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 with Hessian continuous on a convex set U. Show that the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The code uses E = Fin n → ℝ as a model for ℝ^n; Convex ℝ U matches the convexity of U. The assumption hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U encodes that f is twice continuously differentiable (C^2) on U, which entails continuity of the Hessian on U. The conclusion gives, for any compact K ⊆ U and any ε > 0, a δ > 0 such that uniformly over x ∈ K and small v with x+v ∈ U, the Taylor remainder is bounded by ε‖v‖^2. This is precisely the uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets.
- The specific expression for the quadratic term, (1/2) * (((fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x) v) v), is the standard way in Mathlib to write (1/2) times the Hessian at x applied to (v, v). Using the norm on Fin n → ℝ (which is equivalent to the Euclidean norm) is acceptable for such asymptotic/uniform estimates in finite dimensions.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain and smoothness assumptions align: f : ℝ^n → ℝ, C^2 on U, convex U. The code represents ℝ^n as Fin n → ℝ and uses ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U.
- The statement of uniformity on compact subsets is captured by quantifying over compact K ⊆ U and asserting a uniform ε–δ estimate.
- The condition x + v ∈ U is appropriate since only values in U are considered; convexity is included in the hypotheses and matches the natural setup. Although convexity does not appear explicitly in the inequality, it is a standard assumption for the underlying Taylor theorem and is harmless (and helpful) in the intended proof.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all Mathlib terms (Convex, ContDiffOn, fderiv, IsCompact) are legitimate and applicable.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `variable {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E]`: We work in a general normed additive commutative group E. This is a standard setting to talk about absolute convergence via norms.
- `def b_of_grouping (a : ℕ → E) (m : ℕ → ℕ) (k : ℕ) : E := (Finset.Ico (m k) (m (k + 1))).sum fun i => a i`: Given a sequence a and a strictly increasing sequence of cut indices m, the k-th grouped term is the finite sum of a_i over i in the half-open interval [m k, m (k+1)). This formalizes ""grouping consecutive terms"".
- The theorem `abs_summable.grouping_summable_tsum`: If the series of norms ∑ ‖a n‖ converges (absolute convergence), and m is strictly increasing with m 0 = 0, then the grouped series b_of_grouping a m is summable and its sum equals the sum of the original series a (i.e., tsum (b_of_grouping a m) = tsum a).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then any series obtained by grouping terms converges and has the same sum.
- Lean: Assumes absolute summability (Summable (‖a n‖)) and considers any grouping given by a strictly increasing sequence m with m 0 = 0. Concludes the grouped series is summable and has the same sum as the original.
- This matches exactly the mathematical content. The requirement that m is strictly increasing with m 0 = 0 is the standard formalization of ""grouping consecutive terms""; it ensures nonempty consecutive finite blocks that partition the indices. The equality of sums is stated via `tsum`.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Indexing: The natural language starts at n=1, while Lean indexes from ℕ with m 0 = 0. This is a harmless shift; the content is the same.
- Generality: Lean works in a general NormedAddCommGroup E. This is a standard generalization of the real/complex case and is faithful to the statement's intent.
- Coverage of ""any grouping"": The strict monotonicity and m 0 = 0 capture all valid groupings of consecutive terms (no empty groups), and strict monotonicity implies the blocks cover all indices exactly once.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `b_of_grouping` is a legitimate definition; all terms used are standard Mathlib concepts. There are no auxiliary fake definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for an arbitrary natural number n and a set s in the Euclidean space R^n, represented as Fin n → ℝ.
- Hypotheses:
  - hconv : Convex ℝ s — s is convex over ℝ.
  - hbounded : ∃ x0 R, 0 < R ∧ s ⊆ Metric.ball x0 R — s is bounded, i.e., contained in some open ball of positive radius R centered at x0.
- Conclusion:
  - MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume (frontier s) = 0 — the Lebesgue measure (volume) of the topological boundary (frontier) of s is zero.
- The docstring claims: Every bounded convex set in R^n has boundary of volume zero (hence is Jordan measurable).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: “Prove that every bounded convex set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable.”
- The code’s theorem concludes: the boundary of any bounded convex set has Lebesgue measure zero.
- Classically (and in Mathlib), a bounded set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable iff its boundary has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, given the boundedness hypothesis, showing boundary measure zero is sufficient to conclude Jordan measurability. However, the theorem as stated does not assert “s is Jordan measurable”; it only asserts a (standard) sufficient condition.

3) Final comparison:
- The code does not literally or formally state “s is Jordan measurable.” It states a property (boundary has zero Lebesgue measure) which, together with the boundedness already assumed, implies Jordan measurability. The docstring notes “hence is Jordan measurable,” but the formal statement stops short of that conclusion.
- No vacuous placeholders or bogus definitions are present; the hypotheses are legitimate and standard. The only mismatch is that the final goal in the code is slightly different: it proves a sufficient condition rather than the named property itself.
- Therefore, while it is mathematically almost the same and would yield the intended result with one more standard inference step (using the equivalence of Jordan measurability with boundary-measure-zero for bounded sets), it is not a faithful, literal translation of the natural language statement.

Overall: Almost the same but not faithful; it should have concluded the Jordan measurability predicate explicitly.

  sorry",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Universe and setup: We work with ℝ^n modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`. No issues.
- The theorem `second_order_taylor_uniform_on_compact`:
  - Variables: `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)`, `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`.
  - Hypotheses: `hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` (f is C^2 on U), `hU : Convex ℝ U` (U is convex).
  - Claim: For every compact K ⊆ U and every ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ, we have the uniform second-order Taylor remainder estimate:
    | f(x+h) - f x - fderiv ℝ f x h - (1/2) * fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y h) x h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  - The expression `fderiv ℝ f x h` is the first-order term Df(x)(h). The term `fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y h) x h` computes D(Df(·) h)(x) applied to h, i.e. the bilinear second derivative D^2f(x)(h, h). The factor 1/2 matches the Taylor polynomial of order 2.
  - The condition `x + h ∈ U` together with `x ∈ K ⊆ U` and convexity ensures the segment from x to x+h lies in U, which is standard for such Taylor estimates on sets.
  - The quantifiers express uniformity over x ∈ K with a single δ working for all such x.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL statement: f: ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2 with Hessian continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- Code assumptions: `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` exactly means f is C^2 on U (which entails continuity of derivatives up to order 2, i.e., the Hessian continuity), and U is convex. This matches the stated hypotheses (if anything, it is the standard mathlib way to encode them).
- Code conclusion: a uniform quadratic remainder bound on compact K ⊆ U, i.e., for any ε>0 there exists δ>0 uniform over x ∈ K such that the second-order expansion at x has remainder bounded by ε‖h‖^2 for all h with x+h ∈ U and ‖h‖<δ. This is precisely the uniform-on-compacts second-order Taylor expansion statement.
- The second-order term is encoded as 1/2 times D^2 f(x)(h, h) using the expression with nested fderiv; this is mathematically correct and standard in mathlib when avoiding explicit Hessians.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard mathlib objects. There is no placeholder definition.
- The proof is `sorry` but per instructions that is acceptable; we audit only the statement.
- Potential subtlety: the use of `fderiv` (global Fréchet derivative at x) rather than a within-derivative. However, the NL statement assumes f: ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2 (standardly meaning in the ambient sense) on U, and the code assumes `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U`, which is the mathlib formulation for C^2 on the set U. The derivative symbols in the conclusion are the usual ambient derivatives at x, which aligns with the customary meaning of C^2 for a function ℝ^n → ℝ restricted to U. The added hypothesis `x + h ∈ U` ensures evaluation along the line segment remains in U. This is in line with the natural statement and does not misrepresent it.
- The quantifiers and inequality exactly capture “uniform on compact subsets.”

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: imports mathlib.
- `def RiemannIntegrableOn (f : ℝ → ℝ) (s : Set ℝ) : Prop := True`: introduces a placeholder predicate for “f is Riemann integrable on s” defined to be always true for any function f: ℝ → ℝ and any set s ⊆ ℝ. This is a vacuous definition, not mathlib’s notion of Riemann integrability.
- `theorem continuous_on_Icc_riemann_integrable {a b : ℝ} (h : a ≤ b) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) : RiemannIntegrableOn f (Icc a b) := by sorry`: states that if a ≤ b and f is continuous on [a,b], then f is RiemannIntegrableOn on [a,b]. Given the placeholder definition, the conclusion is trivially true, but the proof is left as `sorry`. The statement concerns functions ℝ → ℝ restricted to a closed interval.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: Let (X,d) be a metric space, S ⊆ X totally bounded, and f: S → ℝ continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable. This is about a very general metric space domain and a notion of Riemann integrability on a totally bounded subset of a metric space (nonstandard in mathlib; Riemann integrability is usually for functions on intervals in ℝ). It explicitly mentions totally bounded subsets and arbitrary metric spaces.
- The Lean code, by contrast, is only about functions f: ℝ → ℝ and the domain set s being specifically an interval Icc a b. It does not mention metric spaces (X,d), totally bounded subsets, or f having domain S ⊆ X for general X. Moreover, it uses a vacuous placeholder `RiemannIntegrableOn := True`, not the actual mathlib notion of Riemann integrability.
- Therefore, the code does not represent the original statement either in scope (general metric space vs ℝ-interval), content (totally bounded vs closed interval), or rigor (vacuous predicate).

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. Differences:
  - Domain: NL statement has general metric space X and subset S; Lean code restricts to ℝ and s = [a,b].
  - Hypothesis: NL uses total boundedness of S; Lean uses closed interval [a,b] and continuity on it.
  - Predicate: NL requires a genuine notion of Riemann integrability over S; Lean defines an always-true placeholder and leaves the proof as `sorry`.
  - Even if the placeholder were replaced with a real predicate for Riemann integrability on intervals, the theorem would still be about intervals [a,b], not general totally bounded subsets of a metric space. Hence, even fixing vacuity, it would still not match the NL statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The definition `uniform_converges_on (u : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (s : Set ℝ)` says: there exists a function v : ℝ → ℝ such that for every ε > 0, there exists N ∈ ℕ with the property that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ s, the absolute value |(∑_{k=0}^n u k x) − v x| < ε. This is exactly the standard definition of uniform convergence on s of the series with terms u k (as uniform convergence of partial sums to v).
- The theorem `geometric_series_uniform_converges_on (c : ℝ) (hc1 : 0 ≤ c) (hc2 : c < 1)` asserts: under 0 ≤ c and c < 1, the series with terms u k x = x^k converges uniformly on the closed interval Icc (-c) c, i.e., [-c, c]. The partial sums are expressed as `Finset.sum (range (n + 1)) (fun k => u k x)`, which equals ∑_{k=0}^n u k x = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k. So the statement is: there exists v such that for every ε > 0, there exists N with for all n ≥ N and x ∈ [-c, c], |∑_{k=0}^n x^k − v(x)| < ε.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: For 0 ≤ c < 1, the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on [-c, c]. The Lean theorem states exactly that, using a precise definition of uniform convergence of the series via partial sums and the interval Icc (-c) c = [-c, c]. The hypotheses 0 ≤ c and c < 1 match. The summand is x^k, exponent in ℕ, and the series is over k starting at 0. This matches perfectly.
- The custom definition `uniform_converges_on` is not a placeholder or vacuous; it correctly formalizes uniform convergence of the series’ partial sums on a set. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content of the Lean statement and the NL statement are the same. No discrepancies in domain, interval, hypotheses, or notion of uniform convergence. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:

- Conclusion: ""every open cover of X has a finite subcover"" is exactly the definition of compactness of the whole space. In Mathlib, CompactSpace X means X is compact (i.e., univ is compact), which is equivalent to the open cover definition. Thus the code's conclusion CompactSpace X matches the NL conclusion.
- The restriction to MetricSpace X matches the NL assumption. No extra or missing hypotheses.

3) Final check for differences:

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Complex Finset Set BigOperators: set up mathlib and notation.
- Theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_12556: Given a function f : ℂ → ℂ, a formal multilinear series p, a real R with 1 < R, with f analytic on the open ball ball(0, R), and with HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0, and f 0 ≠ 0, then there exists a real constant C such that for all m : ℕ and z : ℂ with |z| ≤ 1, we have
  | 1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (p.coeff k / f(0)) z^k | ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.
The sum is written as a Finset sum over range (m+1). The assumptions (hR : 1 < R) and (h_analytic : AnalyticOn ℂ f (ball 0 R)) formalize that f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk; h0 is f(0) ≠ 0. The extra hypothesis h_has : HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0 states f has a power series at 0 with coefficients p.

2) Compare to the natural-language statement:
- Natural statement: If f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk and f(0) ≠ 0, then there exists C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and |z| ≤ 1, |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0)) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.
- The code’s domain hypothesis (∃ R > 1 with f analytic on ball(0, R)) is an acceptable formalization of “holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk.” The f(0) ≠ 0 condition matches.
- The conclusion has the same quantifiers and the same type of inequality and growth in |z|^{m+1}. The code uses coefficients p.coeff k in place of f^{(k)}(0)/k!, relying on HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0. Mathematically, for one complex variable, the power-series coefficient in front of z^k equals f^{(k)}(0)/k!; so conceptually this matches.

3) Differences and red flags:
- Technical mismatch: In mathlib, p : FormalMultilinearSeries ℂ ℂ ℂ has p.coeff k a k-multilinear map (not a scalar). The code directly uses p.coeff k as a scalar in (p.coeff k / f(0)) * z^k. This is not the standard, well-typed way to pass from multilinear coefficients to the scalar Taylor coefficients; one should extract the scalar coefficient (equivalent to f^{(k)}(0)/k!) or apply the multilinear map to (z, ..., z). As written, this suggests a type/meaning conflation in the statement.
- The theorem also assumes HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0 in addition to analyticity on a ball; the latter already implies analyticity at 0. This extra hypothesis is redundant but not harmful.

Overall assessment: Conceptually, the intended math statement matches the natural-language theorem (using power-series coefficients equals derivatives divided by k!). However, the Lean statement uses p.coeff k as if it were a scalar coefficient, which in mathlib is not correct without an explicit identification. Being extra harsh per the instructions, this constitutes a mismatch in the formal translation of the precise expression on the left-hand side (it should reference derivatives or the scalar Taylor coefficients, not a multilinear map). Therefore, I judge the translation as not fully faithful.

- `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted (irrelevant for translation fidelity).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
The natural language statement is: show that the series ∑ x^k does not converge uniformly on (-1,1). The negation of uniform convergence of the partial sums to the limit function is: there exists ε > 0 such that for all N, there exists n ≥ N and x in the set with |S_n(x) − s(x)| ≥ ε, where s(x) is the pointwise limit. On |x| < 1, the pointwise limit of ∑ x^k is 1/(1 − x). The Lean statement exactly encodes this negation with s(x) = 1/(1 − x) and domain (-1,1).

3) Final check:
- Domain: (-1,1) vs `Ioo (-1) (1)` — identical.
- Object: series ∑ x^k and its partial sums — correctly represented by `Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) (fun k => x^k)`.
- Uniform convergence negation: quantified as ∃ ε > 0 ∀ N ∃ n ≥ N ∃ x ∈ (-1,1) s.t. error ≥ ε — correct.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only standard Mathlib constructs are used.
- Including the specific limit 1/(1 − x) is appropriate, since uniform convergence refers to convergence to the pointwise limit.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of “the series ∑ x^k does not converge uniformly on (−1,1).”

  On U, g ∘ f = id; on V, f ∘ g = id; and g is complex-analytic at every w ∈ V (i.e., analytic on V). Combined with f''U = V, this implies g(V) ⊆ U and that f|_U: U → V and g|_V: V → U are mutual inverses; hence a local (bi)holomorphic equivalence.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Suppose f: ℂ → ℂ is analytic and f'(z0) ≠ 0. Show that f is a local diffeomorphism at z0 (locally invertible with analytic inverse).”
- The code concludes exactly the local invertibility with an analytic inverse: it finds open neighborhoods U of z0 and V of f z0, and an inverse g analytic on V, with the two-sided inverse identities on U and V. This matches the intended meaning of a local (bi-)holomorphism.
- The code even includes the surjectivity statement f''U = V, which is compatible with the local diffeomorphism notion (and, together with the identities, effectively encodes that the restrictions are inverses).

3) Differences / issues:
- Hypotheses mismatch: The NL hypothesis “f is analytic” for f: ℂ → ℂ typically means holomorphic on all of ℂ (entire). The code assumes only `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0`, i.e., analyticity at the single point z0 (which entails analyticity on some neighborhood of z0, but not necessarily globally). This is strictly weaker than “f is analytic on ℂ”. While the weaker hypothesis still suffices to prove the conclusion, as a translation it is not the same statement.
- Target properties: The code states g is analytic at all points of V, which corresponds to “analytic on V” and matches the NL requirement.
- Domain/codomain of g: The code uses g: ℂ → ℂ rather than g: V → ℂ, but it enforces the inverse identities on V and U and, together with f''U = V and g ∘ f = id on U, implies g(V) ⊆ U. So this is a faithful formalization of a local inverse despite the global type.

Final check: The only substantive mismatch is the hypothesis strength: global analyticity in the NL vs pointwise analyticity at z0 in the code. Everything else aligns well with the intended meaning. Because the task demands a faithful translation (not a stronger theorem under weaker hypotheses), this discrepancy prevents full faithfulness.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- The theorem is stated in a very general setting: E is a real normed vector space. f : E → ℝ, and s ⊆ E.
- Assumptions:
  - h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f s — f is differentiable at every point of s.
  - h_cont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) s — the derivative (as a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ) depends continuously on x when restricted to s.
  - h_comp : IsCompact s — the subset s is compact.
  - h_bdd : ∃ M ≥ 0, ∀ x ∈ s, ∥fderiv ℝ f x∥ ≤ M — the operator norm of the derivative is bounded by M on s.
- Conclusion: ∃ K : NNReal, LipschitzOnWith K f s — there exists a nonnegative constant K such that f is K-Lipschitz on s (i.e., |f x − f y| ≤ K‖x − y‖ for all x,y ∈ s).
- No auxiliary definitions; the proof is omitted (sorry), which is permitted per the task instructions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable with ∇f continuous. Show that f is Lipschitz on compact subsets if ∇f is bounded on those subsets.
- Matching components:
  - “Differentiable with continuous gradient” corresponds to DifferentiableOn and ContinuousOn of the derivative (here via fderiv) on the subset in question. The code assumes these on s; the NL statement assumes them globally, but the target conclusion only uses them on the subset.
  - “On compact subsets” corresponds to IsCompact s in the code.
  - “If ∇f is bounded on those subsets” corresponds to h_bdd (explicit bound M on s).
  - “f is Lipschitz on [those subsets]” corresponds to LipschitzOnWith K f s.
- The code uses fderiv (the Fréchet derivative) instead of the gradient; for ℝ^n → ℝ these notions match via Riesz representation, and Mathlib’s fderiv is the standard formalization.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain generalization: Code is for any real normed space E rather than specifically ℝ^n. This is a standard generalization and preserves the intended meaning (if anything, it proves a stronger statement). This is acceptable as a faithful translation.
- Scope of differentiability/continuity: Code assumes differentiability and continuity of the derivative only on s (DifferentiableOn, ContinuousOn) rather than globally on ℝ^n. Since the claim is about Lipschitz on s and the boundedness is also only assumed on s, this is a benign weakening of hypotheses and still captures the intended statement. It is not logically equivalent to the NL phrasing, but it faithfully expresses the same mathematical content for the subsets under consideration.
- Quantification over compact subsets: The theorem is stated for an arbitrary set s with IsCompact s; this effectively covers “compact subsets.”
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; all Mathlib notions used are standard and appropriate.

Verdict: The code faithfully captures the natural language statement (possibly in a slightly more general setting and with assumptions localized to s). The main mathematical meaning matches: differentiability and continuous derivative, bounded derivative on a compact subset implies Lipschitz on that subset.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def f (z : ℂ) : ℂ := (1 : ℂ) / (z ^ 2 + 1) ^ 2`
  This defines the complex function f(z) = 1 / (z^2 + 1)^2.

- `noncomputable def a (n : ℕ) : ℂ := if n % 2 = 0 then (((n / 2 + 1 : ℕ) : ℂ) * (-1 : ℂ) ^ (n / 2)) else (0 : ℂ)`
  This defines the coefficients a(n) of a power series: if n is even, say n = 2k, then a(n) = (k+1)(-1)^k; if n is odd, a(n) = 0.

- `theorem f_analytic_and_power_series : AnalyticAt ℂ f 0 ∧ (∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z < 1 → f z = tsum (fun n => a n * z ^ n)) ∧ (∀ z : ℂ, 1 < Complex.abs z → ¬ Summable (fun n => a n * z ^ n)) := by sorry`
  This states three things:
  (i) f is analytic at 0 in the complex sense (AnalyticAt ℂ f 0).
  (ii) For every complex z with |z| < 1, f(z) equals the sum of the power series ∑ a(n) z^n.
  (iii) For every complex z with |z| > 1, the series ∑ a(n) z^n is not summable (i.e., it does not converge). This captures that the radius of convergence is 1.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Let f(x) = 1/(x^2+1)^2. Show that f is analytic and find a power series for f at 0 and its radius of convergence.
- The Lean code works over ℂ (complex variable), defining f(z) = 1/(z^2+1)^2, which strengthens the setting. It asserts analyticity at 0, provides an explicit power series representation around 0 with coefficients a(n) corresponding to the known expansion of 1/(1+z^2)^2 via 1/(1+w)^2 = ∑_{k≥0} (k+1)(-w)^k with w = z^2, and states that the series converges for |z| < 1 and diverges for |z| > 1, i.e., radius of convergence 1. This is exactly the intended power series and radius.
- The explicit coefficients match: for n = 2k, a(2k) = (k+1)(-1)^k; for odd n, a(n) = 0. So the series is ∑_{k=0}^∞ (k+1)(-1)^k z^{2k}.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The natural statement uses x (likely real), but asking for analyticity and radius of convergence typically matches the complex setting. The Lean code uses complex analyticity, which is stronger and fully consistent; it still answers the question.
- Scope of analyticity: The Lean statement asserts analyticity at 0 (AnalyticAt at 0), which is sufficient for the requested local power series at 0. The natural statement’s “f is analytic” is somewhat ambiguous (global vs local), but given the next clause asks for a power series at 0 and its radius, asserting AnalyticAt at 0 is appropriate and faithful to the task.
- No vacuous placeholders: The definitions are concrete (no True, none, or sorry in definitions). The theorem has a sorry for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing; the statement itself is precise and matches the math.
- Use of Mathlib notions is standard: AnalyticAt, tsum, Summable.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the problem: it asserts complex analyticity at 0, provides the correct power series centered at 0, and specifies the radius of convergence as 1 via convergence for |z|<1 and divergence for |z|>1.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem bounded_uniformly_continuous_on_riemann {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}` introduces real numbers a, b and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- `(hbound : ∃ M, ∀ x ∈ Icc a b, |f x| ≤ M)` assumes f is bounded on the closed interval [a, b].
- `(huc : UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b))` assumes f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
- `: IntervalIntegrable f volume a b` concludes that f is interval integrable with respect to the Lebesgue measure (volume) on [a, b]. In Mathlib, `IntervalIntegrable f volume a b` is a measure-theoretic (Lebesgue) integrability statement on the interval between a and b.
- `by sorry` omits the proof, which is acceptable for auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose f : [a,b] → ℝ is bounded and uniformly continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable.”
- The Lean statement concludes Lebesgue integrability on [a, b] (`IntervalIntegrable f volume a b`), not Riemann integrability. These are different notions. While the assumptions do imply both Lebesgue and Riemann integrability for such f, the statement expressed in Lean is about Lebesgue integrability, not Riemann integrability. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the target property.
- Other aspects match: boundedness on Icc a b and uniform continuity on Icc a b align with “f : [a,b] → ℝ is bounded and uniformly continuous.” The domain is handled as a function on ℝ restricted to Icc a b, which is fine.
- The possible subtlety about ordering (a ≤ b) is handled by `IntervalIntegrable` which is defined for any a, b, so that is not a major mismatch.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different: the code proves (Lebesgue) interval integrability, not Riemann integrability. These are not the same statements, even though under the given hypotheses the Lebesgue statement is true and weaker. Hence the translation is not faithful.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; Mathlib terms are standard and applicable. The only issue is the wrong integrability notion in the conclusion.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def is_conditionally_convergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)` defines “(a_n) is conditionally convergent” to mean the series ∑ a_n converges but the series of absolute values ∑ |a_n| does not converge (i.e., is not summable). This matches the standard definition over ℝ since ‖x‖ = |x|.
- The theorem `conditional_convergence_of_convergent_nonabsolutely` assumes `Summable a` (the series ∑ a_n converges) and `¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)` (the series of absolute values diverges) and concludes `is_conditionally_convergent a` (i.e., the series is conditionally convergent). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent. The Lean theorem exactly encodes this: hypotheses are convergence of the series and non-summability of absolute values; conclusion is the defined notion of conditional convergence. The custom definition `is_conditionally_convergent` is legitimate and faithful to the standard meaning.

3) Final check and differences:
- Indexing: The NL statement writes sums from n=1 to ∞, whereas Lean’s `Summable` is over ℕ (starting at 0). This shift by finitely many terms does not affect (absolute) convergence, so the statements are logically equivalent. No other discrepancies.
- No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition is precise and standard; no misuse of Mathlib notions.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `variable {X : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedSpace ℝ X]`: X is a real normed vector space (a normed additive commutative group with a compatible ℝ-vector space structure).
- `variable {f : X → ℝ} {x0 : X}`: f is a function from X to ℝ, and x0 is a point in X.
- `theorem fderiv_eq_zero_of_local_min (hf : HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0) (h : IsLocalMin f x0) : (fderiv ℝ f x0 : X →L[ℝ] ℝ) = 0 := by sorry`:
  This states: If f has a Fréchet derivative at x0 and that derivative equals `fderiv ℝ f x0` (which is the standard continuous linear map derivative provided by Mathlib) and if x0 is a local minimum of f (`IsLocalMin f x0`), then the derivative `(fderiv ℝ f x0)` is equal to the zero continuous linear map from X to ℝ.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: In a real normed vector space X, if f: X → ℝ is differentiable at x0 and has a local minimum at x0, then Df(x0) = 0 in L(X, ℝ).
- Lean code: Assumes `HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0` and `IsLocalMin f x0`, concludes `(fderiv ℝ f x0) = 0` in `X →L[ℝ] ℝ`.
- The assumption `HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0` is equivalent to “f is differentiable at x0” in Mathlib: when `DifferentiableAt` holds, there is a lemma giving `HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0`, and conversely `HasFDerivAt` implies differentiability. Thus the hypothesis matches the differentiability requirement.
- `IsLocalMin f x0` exactly formalizes that f attains a local minimum at x0.
- The conclusion asserts the derivative (as a continuous linear map) is the zero map, matching “Df(x0) = 0 in L(X, ℝ)”.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- The scalar field is ℝ as in the statement.
- The slight formalization choice of using `HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0` aligns with differentiability at x0 and is not stronger in a problematic way; it is equivalent in this context.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The Lean statement exactly formalizes: A is a linear map (X →ₗ[K] Y) and is bounded by a constant C (∀ x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C‖x‖), hence A is continuous. This is precisely the usual definition of a bounded linear map implying continuity. The generality over an arbitrary normed field K matches the typical meaning of normed vector spaces and is a harmless (standard) generalization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is permitted by the auditing instructions as long as the statement matches.
- The code requires a specific C and the bound hypothesis; this corresponds to the existence of such a C in the notion of boundedness. That is logically faithful: if A is bounded, there exists such C, and the theorem applies.

3) Final comparison and potential differences:
- Minor nuance: The code does not insist C ≥ 0, but the hypothesis is still sufficient (and stronger if it holds with C < 0, which would force trivial cases). This does not change the meaning of the theorem.
- The notation L(X,Y) in the natural language often denotes the bounded linear operators. The code starts with a general linear map with a bounding hypothesis; this aligns perfectly with the statement ""linear and bounded implies continuous.""
- Therefore, the mathematical meaning matches.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles (m : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal) : Prop := True`
  This introduces a predicate intended to mean “m is the outer measure obtained by covering sets by countably many open rectangles,” but it is defined as `True`. So it imposes no constraints at all on m. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not capture the intended notion.

- `def closed_rectangle (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := Set.Icc a b`
  Defines a closed rectangle in ℝ^n (represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`) as the product of closed intervals `[a_i, b_i]`. This matches the usual notion of a closed rectangle when `a ≤ b` coordinatewise.

- `theorem outer_measure_eq_volume_on_closed_rectangle ... : m (closed_rectangle a b) = Finset.univ.prod (fun i => ENNReal.ofReal (b i - a i)) := by sorry`
  This states: given any set-function m and an (assumed) property `hm : is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles m` together with `a b` and the coordinatewise inequality `a i ≤ b i`, then `m([a,b])` equals the product over coordinates of `b_i - a_i`, considered in `ENNReal` via `ofReal`. This is meant to assert that the outer measure of a closed rectangle equals its volume. However, since `is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles` is defined to be `True`, the hypothesis `hm` is vacuous. Thus, as written, the theorem claims this equality holds for every function `m : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal`, which is far stronger than (and unrelated to) the intended statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: Let m* denote the specific outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles. Show that for any closed rectangle R, m*(R) = V(R).
- The code intends to express: If m is the outer measure coming from coverings by open rectangles, then for closed rectangles `[a, b]`, `m([a, b]) = ∏ (b_i - a_i)`.
- Problems:
  - The predicate `is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles` is vacuous (`True`), so the theorem does not actually restrict `m` to be the intended outer measure. Consequently, the theorem as stated effectively claims the equality for all functions `m`, which is not faithful.
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s `OuterMeasure` structure or any existing construction for Lebesgue outer measure from open rectangles. This is a red flag per the guidelines: the auxiliary definition must faithfully capture the intended concept, but it does not.
  - The theorem uses `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing, but the main issue is the vacuous predicate making the statement itself incorrect in meaning.
  - Positives: The representation of ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ`, closed rectangle as `Icc a b`, and volume as the product `∏ ENNReal.ofReal (b i - a i)` with `a ≤ b` coordinatewise is aligned with the intended content, assuming the measure m were correctly constrained.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code’s theorem, due to the vacuous definition of `is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles`, effectively asserts the volume equality for any set function `m`, not the specific outer measure m*. Even if we interpret the intent charitably, the auxiliary definition is not legitimate and fails to encode the defining property of m*. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.
- If the placeholder predicate were replaced by a proper definition tying m to the outer measure generated by countable open rectangle coverings (and ideally using Mathlib’s `OuterMeasure`), then the theorem statement would match the natural language statement.

Given these issues, the translation fails under the strict guidelines.

- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We fix a natural number n.
- `lemma rademacher_on_convex (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) {U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} (hconv : Convex ℝ U) {K : NNReal} (hL : LipschitzOnWith K f U) : ∀ᵐ x ∂(volume.restrict U), DifferentiableAt ℝ f x := by sorry`
  Translation: Let f: ℝ^n → ℝ (modeled as (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) and let U ⊆ ℝ^n be convex. If f is K-Lipschitz on U (for some nonnegative real K), then f is (Fréchet) differentiable at almost every point x with respect to the Lebesgue measure restricted to U. No proof is provided (sorry), but the statement is clear.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original natural language statement.
- Original statement: ""Suppose f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable and Lipschitz on a convex set U. Show that f is differentiable almost everywhere on U (Rademacher's theorem in this context).""
- The Lean code states Rademacher's theorem in the standard form: Lipschitz on U implies differentiable almost everywhere on U (w.r.t. Lebesgue measure restricted to U).
- The original statement, however, assumes that f is already differentiable on U and Lipschitz on U. If one literally assumes f is differentiable on U, the conclusion ""differentiable almost everywhere on U"" is trivial. The Lean code does not assume differentiability on U; it only assumes Lipschitz on U.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Difference: The original statement includes an extra assumption: f is differentiable (everywhere on U). The Lean statement omits this and asserts the stronger, standard Rademacher result: Lipschitz ⇒ differentiable a.e. on U.
- Everything else matches well: domain ℝ^n, codomain ℝ, convex subset U, Lipschitz on U, and the conclusion stated with volume.restrict U. The notion of differentiability is DifferentiableAt ℝ f x, i.e., Fréchet differentiability at x, which is the standard one in R^n.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; standard Mathlib notions are used appropriately.

Conclusion: While the Lean code captures the intended Rademacher theorem, it is not a faithful translation of the literal natural language statement due to the extra ""differentiable"" assumption in the latter, which makes the problem trivial. Hence, not faithful.

- `theorem mstar_union_le {α : Type _} (mstar : Set α → ENNReal) ... (A B : Set α) : mstar (A ∪ B) ≤ mstar A + mstar B := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type α and any set function mstar: P(α) → [0, ∞], if mstar is countably subadditive (i.e., for every sequence s: ℕ → Set α, we have mstar(⋃ i, s i) ≤ ∑' i, mstar(s i)), then for any sets A, B ⊆ α, we have mstar(A ∪ B) ≤ mstar(A) + mstar(B).

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
Original statement: Let m* be the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles. Prove that for any A, B ⊆ ℝ^n, m*(A ∪ B) ≤ m*(A) + m*(B).

The Lean theorem states a general finite subadditivity result for any function satisfying countable subadditivity on any type α, not specifically for m* on ℝ^n defined via open rectangles. It assumes countable subadditivity as a hypothesis instead of defining m* (outer measure), nor does it reference ℝ^n, outer measures, or the construction via open rectangles. While the desired inequality follows as a special case (since outer measures are countably subadditive), the code does not encode the specific context or definition requested. It is a general lemma rather than a faithful translation of the specific problem statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain mismatch: Code works for arbitrary type α; the statement is about ℝ^n.
- Object mismatch: Code takes an arbitrary set function mstar with countable subadditivity; the statement specifies the outer measure m* defined via coverings by open rectangles.
- Missing definitions: No mention of outer measure, ℝ^n, or open rectangles; instead, countable subadditivity is postulated as a hypothesis.
- Although the inequality is a direct corollary, the code is not a faithful translation of the stated problem’s specific objects and context.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present, and the statement is mathematically correct as a general result, but it does not faithfully encode the specific m* and its construction.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and setup: We work in Mathlib, with topology opened. The ambient space is (Fin n → ℝ), which is a standard representation of ℝ^n in Lean, equipped with its canonical norm (the sup norm on the Pi type).

- The theorem statement:
  Name: second_order_taylor_uniform_on_compacts
  Parameters:
  • n : ℕ, f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ.
  • U : Set (Fin n → ℝ).
  • hfd : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, i.e., f is C^2 on the set U in the sense of Frechet differentiability along the set U (within-filter notion).
  • hUconv : Convex ℝ U.

  Conclusion:
  For every compact K ⊆ U and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h : (Fin n → ℝ), if ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, then
    | f (x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the (ambient) Frechet derivative of f at x as a map on the whole space; and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the (ambient) Frechet derivative at x of the map y ↦ fderiv ℝ f y, yielding the second derivative as a continuous bilinear form via currying, which is then evaluated on (h, h) and multiplied by 1/2.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 and H_f (the Hessian) continuous on a convex set U. Show that the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
  This means: for each compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and sufficiently small h with x+h ∈ U, the remainder |f(x+h) − f(x) − Df(x)[h] − (1/2) D^2f(x)[h,h]| ≤ ε ‖h‖^2, uniformly in x ∈ K.

- Positives:
  • Domain: (Fin n → ℝ) models ℝ^n; acceptable.
  • Hypotheses: ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U assumes C^2 on U; this is at least as strong as “f is C^2 on U” and implies continuity of the Hessian, matching or exceeding the NL requirement “H_f continuous in U”. The convexity hypothesis is present, as in the NL statement.
  • Conclusion: The inequality with ε ‖h‖^2, uniform in x ∈ K, for small ‖h‖ with x + h ∈ U, matches the usual uniform second-order Taylor approximation on compact subsets.
  • The second derivative term ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h matches the Hessian quadratic form D^2 f(x)[h,h] in Frechet calculus.

- Critical mismatch:
  • The code uses ambient derivatives fderiv ℝ f x and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x. However, the only differentiability assumption provided is ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, i.e., differentiability within the set U. The set U is only assumed convex, not open. In Mathlib, ContDiffOn over a non-open set guarantees within-derivatives (fderivWithin), not necessarily ambient derivatives (fderiv). The correct formalization for a general (possibly non-open) U should use within derivatives: fderivWithin ℝ f U x and the second within-derivative of y ↦ fderivWithin ℝ f U y at x.
  • Because fderiv ℝ f x is the ambient derivative, it may not coincide with the within derivative if x is on the boundary of U, and it might not even be the actual derivative (Mathlib defines fderiv total, defaulting to 0 when not DifferentiableAt). The theorem statement, as written, asserts the expansion using the ambient derivatives, which is stronger and potentially different from the intended within-U Taylor expansion.
  • The natural language statement speaks about Taylor expansion “in U” (guided by the continuity of the Hessian on U and convexity), which allows staying within U along the segment; that matches a within-derivative framework, not necessarily the ambient derivative unless U is open. Since openness is not assumed, using ambient fderiv is not faithful.

- Minor considerations:
  • Norm choice (sup norm vs Euclidean) is fine in finite dimensions; the property is invariant under equivalent norms.
  • The extra explicit mention of Hessian continuity in the NL is redundant under the ContDiffOn ℝ 2 assumption; that does not harm faithfulness.

Final check:
- Due to the use of ambient derivatives instead of within derivatives under non-open U, the Lean statement does not faithfully capture the NL statement. It imposes a different derivative notion at boundary points and can diverge from the intended within-U Taylor expansion. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade justification:
- The structure, quantifiers, and inequality are almost correct, but the derivative notion is a substantive mismatch. Hence, it is “almost the same but not faithful.”

- `def ConditionallyConvergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)`: This defines ""a real series is conditionally convergent"" to mean exactly that the series ∑ a_n converges (is summable) but the series of absolute values ∑ |a_n| does not converge (is not summable). This matches the standard mathematical definition.
- `theorem cond_conv_of_convergent_not_abs {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h_sum : Summable a) (h_not_abs : ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)) : ConditionallyConvergent a := by sorry`: Statement: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent. This is a direct restatement of the definition packaged as a theorem; the proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation checking.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Natural language: ""Suppose ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges. Show that the series is conditionally convergent.""
- Lean: Assumes `Summable a` and `¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)` and concludes `ConditionallyConvergent a`, where that predicate is defined as exactly those two conditions. This is a perfect match.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The Lean code specifies real series (`ℝ`). The natural language statement did not specify a domain but is most commonly stated for real (or complex) series. Specializing to reals does not change the mathematical meaning of the claim.
- Use of standard Mathlib terms: `Summable` and absolute value are standard. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The auxiliary definition `ConditionallyConvergent` is faithful to the intended concept.
- No extraneous or misleading definitions. The theorem statement exactly matches the claim.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`: We work in a finite-dimensional real normed vector space E (so, effectively, a generalization of ℝ^n).
- The theorem `max_on_compact_interior_has_fderiv_zero` assumes: `K : Set E`, `f : E → ℝ`, `x0 : E`, with `IsCompact K` (K compact), `ContinuousOn f K` (f is continuous on K), `DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K)` (f is differentiable on the interior of K), `x0 ∈ interior K`, and `∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x0` (f attains a maximum on K at x0).

All hypotheses (compactness of K, continuity on K, differentiability on int(K), x0 ∈ int(K), and that x0 is a maximizer on K) are present. The conclusion matches: the Fréchet derivative (appropriate generalization of the derivative) at x0 is zero.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is a standard generalization from ℝ^n to an arbitrary finite-dimensional real normed vector space E, which is mathematically equivalent for this result and does not change the meaning of the statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

end noncomputable section
",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def f (x : ℝ) := exp x * cos x` defines the real function f(x) = e^x cos x.
- The theorem `jirilebl_ra_ch_approximate_327` states a conjunction:
  - `AnalyticAt ℝ f 0`: f is real-analytic at 0.
  - There exists a sequence of real coefficients `a : ℕ → ℝ` such that
    • For every n, `a n = ∑_{m=0}^{⌊n/2⌋} (-1)^m / ((n - 2m)! (2m)!)` (implemented as `Finset.sum (Finset.range (n / 2 + 1)) ...`).
    • For all real x, the power series ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n x^n converges (HasSum) to f x.

This is a standard convolution formula for the Maclaurin coefficients of e^x cos x, and the statement that the series sums to f(x) for all x expresses global convergence (infinite radius of convergence), although the radius is not explicitly named.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL: ""Let f(x) = e^x cos x. Prove that f is analytic and find a power series for f at 0 and its radius of convergence.""
- Lean: Proves (i) f is analytic at 0 (not globally), and (ii) gives an explicit Maclaurin series (coefficients) that converges to f(x) for all real x.

3) Are they the same?
- Power series at 0: Yes. The coefficients given match the convolution of e^x and cos x series, so this is a correct Maclaurin series for f.
- Radius of convergence: The Lean statement asserts that the series converges to f(x) for every real x (∀ x, HasSum ... = f x), which is stronger than saying the radius of convergence is infinite. So the radius is implicitly ∞; however, the code does not explicitly mention ""radius of convergence"".
- Analyticity: The natural language phrase ""f is analytic"" most naturally means analytic on ℝ (or at least in some neighborhood of each point). The Lean statement only asserts `AnalyticAt ℝ f 0`. While the global series identity would in fact imply analyticity everywhere, the theorem does not explicitly state `AnalyticOn ℝ` or `AnalyticAt ℝ f x` for all x. Given the instruction to be extra harsh, this is a mismatch in the explicit statement.

Conclusion: The code faithfully provides the Maclaurin series (with correct coefficients) and encodes infinite radius via global convergence. However, it only asserts analyticity at 0, not that f is analytic on ℝ. Also, the radius is not stated explicitly (though it follows from the ∀ x statement). Because of these small but real mismatches, the translation is very close but not perfectly faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Nat}` introduces a natural number n.
- `variable {m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal}` declares a function m_star from subsets of ℝ^n (modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`) to extended nonnegative reals. There is no assertion that this is a (specific) outer measure; it's just an arbitrary function.
- The theorem `outer_measure_add_on_disjoint_open_rectangles` has parameters:
  - `R : Fin n → Set (Fin n → ℝ)`: a family of sets in ℝ^n indexed by `Fin n` (so exactly n sets).
  - `h_mstar : True`: a placeholder assumption intended to represent “m_star is an outer measure,” but as written it imposes no constraint at all.
  - `h_rect : ∀ i : Fin n, True`: a placeholder assumption intended to represent “each R i is an open rectangle,” but again it imposes no constraint.
  - `h_disj : Pairwise (fun i j : Fin n => Disjoint (R i) (R j))`: the only substantive assumption: the sets are pairwise disjoint.
  - Conclusion: `m_star (⋃ i, R i) = ∑ i, m_star (R i)`: the value of m_star on the union equals the finite sum over all indices.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing the statement, but the key issue is the content of the assumptions.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Let m^* be the outer measure on ℝ^n. Suppose R_1,…,R_n are pairwise disjoint open rectangles. Prove that m^*(⋃_{k=1}^n R_k) = ∑_{k=1}^n m^*(R_k).”
- Issues:
  - The code uses an arbitrary function `m_star` with no constraint (only `True`). The NL statement refers to “the outer measure on ℝ^n,” which standardly means the Lebesgue outer measure. This is not captured at all.
  - The property “R_i are open rectangles” is not encoded; it is replaced by `True` placeholder.
  - The code indexes the family of rectangles by `Fin n`, which matches the NL’s reuse of the symbol n for both dimension and number of rectangles. While unusual in mathematics, the NL text does indeed say R_1,…,R_n in ℝ^n, so this part is arguably consistent.
  - Even if we ignore the missing proof, the theorem statement as written claims the equality for any function `m_star` and any sets `R i` that are pairwise disjoint, since the other hypotheses are vacuous. This is not faithful to the intended statement.
  - Moreover, even replacing `h_mstar : True` with “m_star is an outer measure” would still not be faithful, since the NL means the specific Lebesgue outer measure (for which rectangles are measurable and additivity holds via the corresponding measure), not an arbitrary outer measure (for which additivity on disjoint sets need not hold). So the code misses this key specificity.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code’s theorem is vastly weaker/more general syntactically but in fact vacuous with respect to the essential assumptions (outer measure structure and open rectangles) because they are replaced by `True`. It also does not specify the canonical (Lebesgue) outer measure. Thus it does not faithfully translate the original statement.

Additional red flags per guidelines:
- The placeholders `h_mstar : True` and `h_rect : ∀ i, True` are vacuous; this violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions/assumptions not be vacuous placeholders.
- The function `m_star` is not tied to Mathlib’s `OuterMeasure` or the Lebesgue outer measure. No Mathlib concepts for rectangles or measurability are used.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` and `noncomputable section`, `open Complex`: boilerplate, not affecting the mathematical content.
- Comment claims: formal statement that if f is analytic and nonvanishing, there exists holomorphic g with f = exp ∘ g; but warns that the analytic/holomorphic hypothesis is left abstract as True. This is already a red flag: using True as a placeholder for analyticity is vacuous.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem exists_holomorphic_log (f : ℂ → ℂ) (h_analytic : True) (h_nonvanish : ∀ z : ℂ, f z ≠ 0) : ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, ∀ z : ℂ, f z = Complex.exp (g z) := by sorry`
  Natural language translation: For any function f: ℂ → ℂ, assuming True (i.e., no real hypothesis) and that f(z) ≠ 0 for all z, there exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ such that for all z, f(z) = exp(g(z)).
  Notably, there is no assertion that g is holomorphic. Also, the hypothesis that f is analytic is replaced by the vacuous predicate True.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let f: ℂ → ℂ be analytic and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.
- Missing holomorphic property of g: The Lean theorem only asserts the existence of a function g with f = exp ∘ g, not that g is holomorphic. This is a major omission.
- Vacuous analyticity: The Lean hypothesis `h_analytic : True` does not encode “f is analytic/holomorphic”. This is a second major mismatch.
- Nonvanishing condition is present and correctly stated.
- Equality f = exp ∘ g is correctly captured pointwise.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The Lean code proves (if it had a proof) a much weaker, and actually impossible in general, statement: from mere nonvanishing (and no analyticity), there exists some function g with f = exp ∘ g; moreover it doesn’t require g to be holomorphic. The original requires f to be analytic (entire) and concludes the existence of a holomorphic (entire) g. The Lean code:
- Uses a vacuous predicate for analyticity (problem per guidelines).
- Omits holomorphy of g entirely.
- Does not use appropriate Mathlib predicates like `Differentiable ℂ f`/`AnalyticOn`, or `HolomorphicOn`, etc.
Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grading justification:
- Vacuous auxiliary hypothesis (`True`) for analyticity: fails guideline 3.
- Missing the crucial “holomorphic g” in the conclusion: even fixing the vacuous hypothesis would not make the statement faithful; the conclusion is still too weak. This matches rubric: makes up vacuous definitions and even if fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- Definition: `noncomputable def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 1 / (1 + x ^ 2)` defines f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2) on the real numbers.
- Theorem statement: `theorem f_power_series_at_zero : ∀ x : ℝ, |x| < 1 → f x = tsum (fun n : ℕ => ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * x ^ (2 * n))` states: For all real x with |x| < 1, f(x) equals the series sum from n=0 to ∞ of (-1)^n x^(2n). This asserts that the Maclaurin series 1 - x^2 + x^4 - ... converges to f(x) for |x| < 1.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language asks to: (i) show f is analytic, (ii) find a power series for f at 0, and (iii) find its radius of convergence.
- The Lean theorem provides a specific power series at 0 and the domain of convergence where it equals f: |x| < 1. This captures (ii) and implicitly indicates a radius of convergence at least 1 for that series. However, it does not explicitly state the radius equals 1, only that the equality holds on |x| < 1.
- It does not assert analyticity in Mathlib terms (e.g., AnalyticAt ℝ f 0 or AnalyticOn ℝ univ). While the equality to a power series on a neighborhood implies analyticity at 0, the code does not state this property.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Differences:
  - Missing explicit statement that f is analytic (either at 0 or on ℝ). The code only gives an equality to a series on |x| < 1, not an AnalyticAt/AnalyticOn predicate.
  - Missing explicit statement that the radius of convergence is exactly 1. The restriction |x| < 1 suggests the radius, but the theorem does not assert maximality.
- Positives:
  - The power series given is correct: Σ (-1)^n x^(2n).
  - The domain |x| < 1 is correct for convergence to f.

Conclusion: The code captures the correct series expansion and where it equals f, but omits the explicit analyticity statement and the explicit radius of convergence. Hence, it is not a fully faithful translation of the original problem statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- Comment describes the goal: absolute convergence implies invariance under rearrangements.
- `open Function`: Opens the Function namespace (for `Equiv`).
- Theorem statement: `theorem tsum_of_abs_summable_rearrangement {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h : Summable fun n => |a n|) (e : ℕ ≃ ℕ) : tsum (fun n => a (e n)) = tsum a := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let a be a real sequence indexed by natural numbers. Assume the series is absolutely summable, i.e., the series of absolute values is summable. Let e be a bijection of ℕ (a permutation). Then the sum of the rearranged series `a ∘ e` equals the sum of the original series `a`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Absolute convergence assumption: `Summable fun n => |a n|` exactly matches absolute convergence over ℝ.
- Rearrangement: Represented by `e : ℕ ≃ ℕ`, a bijection/permutation of indices. This is the standard formalization of rearrangements.
- Conclusion: `tsum (fun n => a (e n)) = tsum a` expresses that the sum of the rearranged series equals the original sum.
- Use of `tsum`: In Mathlib, for summable series over ℝ, `tsum` is the canonical sum. Absolute summability implies summability, so both sides are meaningful and coincide with the usual infinite series sum.

3) Final comparison:
- Indexing difference (original from n=1, Lean uses ℕ starting at 0) is immaterial: one can insert a zero term at n=0 or reindex; absolute convergence and sum are unaffected by a finite shift. This is a harmless conventional difference, not a change in mathematical meaning.
- Domain specialization to ℝ is standard; the original did not specify a codomain, but ℝ is a typical intended setting and the statement remains faithful for this case.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem directly states the intended property.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {a b : ℝ}` introduces real endpoints a and b.
- The theorem `uniform_on_interval_integral_mul` has parameters:
  - `hab : a ≤ b` ensures we are indeed on the (nonempty) closed interval [a,b].
  - `hg : ContinuousOn g (Icc a b)` states g is continuous on [a,b].
  - `h_uniform : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x ∈ Icc a b, |f n x - f_lim x| ≤ ε` asserts that f_n → f_lim uniformly on [a,b] (the ≤ version is equivalent to the < version for uniform convergence when quantified over all ε > 0).
- Conclusion: `Tendsto (fun n => ∫ x in a..b, (f n x) * g x) atTop (nhds (∫ x in a..b, f_lim x * g x))` says the sequence of integrals ∫_a^b f_n(x) g(x) dx converges to ∫_a^b f_lim(x) g(x) dx.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL: Suppose f_n → f uniformly on [a,b] and g is continuous on [a,b]. Prove lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n g = ∫_a^b f g.
- Lean: Exactly the same hypotheses (uniform convergence on Icc a b, g continuous on Icc a b) and the same conclusion in terms of the interval integral. The integration is over [a,b] with `a ≤ b` explicitly assumed, which matches the conventional reading of [a,b]. The conclusion is expressed as a `Tendsto` statement, which is equivalent to the limit equality.

3) Final check for differences:
- Type of integral: Lean’s `∫ x in a..b` is the standard interval integral (Lebesgue-based in Mathlib), while the NL statement leaves the integral notion implicit. As a translation of the claim, this is standard and faithful; no placeholder or vacuous definitions are used.
- No extra or missing assumptions: continuity of g on [a,b] and uniform convergence of f_n to f on [a,b] are present. The added `a ≤ b` is implicit in the phrase “on [a,b]”.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but no specific concepts are used.
- def is_rectangle {n : ℕ} (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True: Introduces a predicate meant to mean “R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n,” but it is defined as True for all R. This is a vacuous placeholder.

However, due to the dummy predicates, the hypotheses and conclusions are all trivially True. The proof is omitted with sorry.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The intended mathematical statement: For R ⊆ ℝ^n a closed rectangle and f, g: R → ℝ Riemann integrable, then φ(x) = max{f(x), g(x)} and ψ(x) = min{f(x), g(x)} are Riemann integrable on R.
- The Lean code uses functions f, g defined on the ambient space (Fin n → ℝ) with a predicate RiemannIntegrableOn f R. That formulation is acceptable in principle (equivalent to f, g: R → ℝ via restriction). However, both is_rectangle and RiemannIntegrableOn are defined as True, so they do not capture the actual mathematical content. Hence the lemma is vacuous and does not express the genuine claim.
- Additionally, the code avoids using actual Mathlib notions for rectangles or Riemann integrability, which is a red flag per the guidelines. The proof is also left as sorry, but the main failure is the vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code’s predicates are vacuous, so the statement holds for every set R and every function f, g, which is not the original claim. If the dummy predicates were replaced by faithful definitions, the final lemma statement would match the original statement. As written, it is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definitions render the statement trivial. However, if those were replaced by proper definitions, the lemma statement’s shape would be faithful. This matches the rubric’s “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” corresponding to a grade around 6.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Use Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- Variables: R is a commutative ring; n is a finite type with decidable equality (so we can talk about n×n matrices indexed by n).
- Theorems stated (all with sorry, i.e., proofs omitted):
  - det_eq_zero_iff_cols_linear_dependent (A : Matrix n n R): A.det = 0 if and only if the columns of A (viewed as the family A.col : n → (n → R)) are not linearly independent over R.
  - det_ne_zero_iff_cols_linear_independent (A : Matrix n n R): A.det ≠ 0 if and only if the columns of A are linearly independent over R.
  - det_eq_zero_iff_rows_linear_dependent (A : Matrix n n R): A.det = 0 if and only if the rows of A (implemented as the columns of A.transpose) are not linearly independent over R.
  - det_ne_zero_iff_rows_linear_independent (A : Matrix n n R): A.det ≠ 0 if and only if the rows of A are linearly independent over R.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The NL statement: For an n×n matrix A with det(A) = 0, the columns (or rows) are linearly dependent. Also, if det(A) ≠ 0, the columns (or rows) are linearly independent. It also requests avoiding Laplace formula in the proof (irrelevant to the statement itself).

The Lean code asserts stronger equivalences: det(A) = 0 ↔ columns dependent, and det(A) ≠ 0 ↔ columns independent, and similarly for rows. Providing equivalences is fine if true under the same assumptions, and it encapsulates both directions requested.

Step 3: Faithfulness check and potential issues.
- Base ring issue: The Lean code works over an arbitrary commutative ring R. The classical statements in linear algebra (det ≠ 0 ⇒ columns independent; det = 0 ⇒ columns dependent) are valid over fields (or more generally integral domains for these particular implications). Over a general commutative ring with zero divisors, the equivalences stated in the code are false. For example, over R = Z/6Z, the matrix diag(1,2) has det = 2 ≠ 0, but its columns are linearly dependent: 3·(0,2) = (0,0) with 3 ≠ 0. Thus the code claims statements that are not valid under its assumptions, whereas the NL statement is typically intended over a field (e.g., real or complex numbers), even though it didn't explicitly specify the field. Therefore, the code overgeneralizes the context and is not a faithful translation.
- Strength of statements: The code uses ↔ (iff), which is stronger than the two implications asked. This is acceptable if done under correct assumptions (e.g., Field R). But combined with the overly general ring assumption, it becomes incorrect.
- Use of mathlib notions: A.col and A.transpose.col are standard and correctly represent columns and rows. No vacuous definitions are introduced; all statements are genuine propositions. Proofs are omitted, which is allowed by the auditing instructions as long as the statements themselves are faithful.

Conclusion: The main discrepancy is the assumption [CommRing R] instead of the appropriate [Field R] (or at least [IsDomain R] for the directions stated). As written, the Lean statements are not faithful to the intended classical result. Adjusting the typeclass to [Field R] would fix faithfulness. Therefore, the translation fails.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib; open BigOperators: Brings in Mathlib and big-operator notation (sums, products).
- theorem cauchy_product_real {a b : ℕ → ℝ} (ha : Summable fun n => abs (a n)) (hb : Summable b) : ... := by sorry
  • a, b are sequences of real numbers indexed by natural numbers.
  • ha: the series ∑ |a n| is summable (absolute convergence of ∑ a n).
  • hb: the series ∑ b n is summable (convergent).
  • Conclusion (two parts):
    1) Summable (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k)))
       This says the series with nth term c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} is summable (converges).
    2) tsum (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))) = (tsum a) * (tsum b)
       The sum of the series ∑ c_n equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
  • Using Finset.range (n+1) realizes the finite sum k=0..n; n − k is natural subtraction and valid on this range.
  • abs on ℝ coincides with the norm, so ha expresses absolute convergence of ∑ a_n.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges, then c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} defines a convergent series, and its sum equals the product of the sums.
- Lean: Exactly asserts absolute summability of a, summability of b, defines c_n as the Cauchy product term, proves the series ∑ c_n is summable and that its sum equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- Domain: The Lean statement is for real sequences; the natural language did not specify a domain, and ℝ is a standard intended setting. This is a faithful specialization.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with standard Mathlib notions (Summable, tsum, Finset.sum).
- The mathematical content matches exactly: absolute convergence of a, convergence of b, Cauchy product summability and sum equals product of sums.
- Using abs rather than norm is fine for ℝ; no mismatch.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `theorem seq_min_nonpos {x : ℕ → ℝ} {L : ℝ} (h : Filter.Tendsto x Filter.atTop (nhds L)) : ...`:
  Interprets x as a real sequence indexed by natural numbers, and L a real number such that x tends to L as n → ∞ (in filter language: Tendsto x atTop (nhds L)).
- Conclusion: `Filter.Tendsto (fun n => min (x n) 0) Filter.atTop (nhds (min L 0)) ∧ min L 0 ≤ 0`:
  This states two things: (i) the sequence y_n = min(x_n, 0) converges to min(L, 0); (ii) min(L, 0) ≤ 0.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
Natural language: Let {x_n} be convergent and define y_n = min{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≤ 0.
- The assumption in Lean (Tendsto x → L) formalizes ""{x_n} is convergent"" by giving its limit L.
- The Lean conclusion asserts y_n converges to min(L, 0) and that min(L, 0) ≤ 0. Therefore the limit of y_n exists and equals min(L, 0), so lim y_n ≤ 0. This exactly implies the requested inequality about the limit and in fact is stronger (it identifies the limit as min(L, 0)).

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The Lean statement directly implies the desired result: from Tendsto to (nhds (min L 0)) we know lim y_n = min(L, 0), and since min(L, 0) ≤ 0, we get lim y_n ≤ 0. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions, and the Mathlib notions are standard (Filter.Tendsto, nhds, min). The code includes extra information (the exact limit) but that is acceptable and faithful to the intended meaning.
- No discrepancies beyond being stronger; no red flags.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Define (noncomputably) some linear map from the ℝ-polynomials to ℝ-polynomials. The body is `sorry`, i.e., a placeholder; no actual definition is provided.

2) Does this faithfully translate the NL statement?
- The NL statement is specifically about the derivative operator D: R[t] → R[t], asserting that D is linear. To faithfully translate this, the code should define the derivative operator as a linear map, e.g., by referencing Mathlib’s derivative and giving a linear map structure, something like `def derivativeLinearMap : Polynomial ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] Polynomial ℝ := ...` using the derivative.
- The provided code neither mentions the derivative function nor ties the linear map to the derivative. It merely introduces a name for some linear map type with a `sorry` body. Therefore it does not assert that the derivative is linear, nor does it even define the derivative as a map.
- Moreover, the `sorry` makes the definition vacuous: it compiles but does not provide content. Per the auditing guidelines, vacuous placeholders cause the translation to fail.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: “Show that D (the derivative on R[t]) is a linear operator.”
- Lean code: “There exists a def named `jirilebl_ra_ch_several_vars_ders_1015` of type Polynomial ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] Polynomial ℝ, but its definition is omitted (`sorry`).”
- Differences:
  - No connection to the derivative operator at all.
  - Uses a placeholder (`sorry`), so the purported linear map is not defined.
  - Even if the type matches the intended form, the content is missing; the statement does not establish that the derivative is linear.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation. If the `sorry` were replaced by Mathlib’s derivative as a linear map (e.g., a proper construction of `derivative` as a `LinearMap`), it would become faithful. Hence grade reflects vacuous definition but fixable to match the statement.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: ""Let f be entire and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show that there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.""
- The Lean hypotheses exactly capture ""f is entire"" (modeled as complex differentiable at every point) and ""f has no zeros"". The conclusion states there exists a holomorphic (indeed entire) g with f = exp ∘ g pointwise.

- No extra conditions are added; no required conditions are omitted. The equality is pointwise over all z, as expected.

Final check:

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`, `open Topology`: set up Mathlib and filters/topology notation.
- The theorem `seq_max_limit_nonneg {x : ℕ → ℝ} {l : ℝ} (h : Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 l))` assumes a real sequence `x_n` that converges to a real number `l` (expressed as `Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 l)`).
- The conclusion is a conjunction: `(1) Tendsto (fun n => max (x n) 0) atTop (𝓝 (max l 0))`, which says the sequence `y_n := max(x_n, 0)` converges to `max(l, 0)`; and `(2) 0 ≤ max l 0`, which says that this limit is nonnegative.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let {x_n} be convergent and define y_n = max{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≥ 0.
- The hypothesis in Lean, `Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 l)`, is exactly that x_n converges to l; this just names the limit.
- The Lean conclusion is stronger: it identifies the limit of y_n as `max l 0` and asserts that this value is ≥ 0.
- From these, it follows immediately that lim y_n ≥ 0. Thus the Lean statement implies the original claim.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The Lean theorem proves a stronger result than requested but directly entails the target statement. There is no mismatch in hypotheses (both concern a real sequence converging) and the conclusion logically contains the desired conclusion. Therefore, the translation is faithful to the mathematical meaning of the original statement.

- Comment explains the goal: reverse triangle inequality for real numbers.
- `theorem jirilebl_reverse_triangle_1211 (x y : ℝ) : abs (abs x - abs y) ≤ abs (x - y) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any real numbers x and y, | |x| − |y| | ≤ |x − y|. The `abs` is the real absolute value; the variables are ℝ; the inequality is exactly the reverse triangle inequality.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The statement exactly matches the natural language: same domain (ℝ), same inequality, same form.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the task’s allowance (no proof required), and does not change the statement.

3) Final check: The two math problems are the same. There are no differences in quantification, domain, or inequality direction. The code uses |x − y| (not |y − x|), which matches the given statement; either way absolute value makes them equal, but here it’s exactly the same.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Context: We work in Mathlib with sets. The ambient space for R^n is modeled as (Fin n → ℝ), which is standard in Mathlib.
- Theorem statement:
  - Variables: n : ℕ, U : Set (Fin n → ℝ), f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ.
  - Hypotheses: hU : IsOpen U (U is open), hdiff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f U (f is differentiable on U), hconv : ConvexOn ℝ U f (f is convex on U).
  - Conclusion: For all x, y with x ∈ U and y ∈ U, and for all t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 (i.e., t ∈ [0,1]), we have the inequality f (t • x + (1 - t) • y) ≤ t * f x + (1 - t) * f y.
  - Notation: • is scalar multiplication on (Fin n → ℝ), and + is vector addition. This is the standard convexity inequality.
- The proof is elided with `sorry`, but that's acceptable here since we only judge the translation of the statement.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL statement: Let U ⊆ ℝ^n be open and f : U → ℝ be differentiable. If f is convex on U, then for all x, y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], f(tx + (1 − t)y) ≤ t f(x) + (1 − t) f(y).
- The Lean statement exactly asserts the convexity inequality under the same assumptions: U open, f differentiable on U, f convex on U, for all x,y ∈ U, and t ∈ [0,1]. The use of (Fin n → ℝ) for ℝ^n and writing f as a total function with DifferentiableOn ℝ f U are standard formalizations of the same mathematical content.

Step 3: Final check of sameness and differences.
- Domain/codomain: NL has f : U → ℝ; Lean has f : ℝ^n → ℝ with DifferentiableOn ℝ f U and restricts x,y to U. This is a faithful formalization.
- Openness and differentiability: Both included as assumptions, though not needed for the inequality itself; still consistent with the NL statement.
- Convexity inequality: Precisely matches, with t ∈ [0,1] and the expression t • x + (1 - t) • y.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib notions (ConvexOn, DifferentiableOn, IsOpen, Icc) are used.
- No hidden change in meaning. The theorem is exactly the usual convexity inequality under the stated assumptions.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  Translation: For any set R in ℝ^n with the property IsClosedRectangle, and functions f, g with the property RiemannIntegrableOn R (i.e., integrable on R in the sense of this arbitrary predicate), then the scalar multiple a·f, the sum f+g, and the product f·g also satisfy RiemannIntegrableOn R. The proof is omitted (sorry). This is a statement about two arbitrary predicates; it does not use Mathlib’s real definitions.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The natural language statement: For a closed rectangle R ⊂ ℝ^n, the set of Riemann integrable functions on R is an algebra; i.e., if f, g are Riemann integrable on R and a ∈ ℝ, then af, f+g, and fg are Riemann integrable on R.
- The code uses placeholders for both “closed rectangle” and “Riemann integrable on R”, namely IsClosedRectangle and RiemannIntegrableOn, which are arbitrary predicates with no connection to Mathlib’s definitions. Therefore, the theorem as written does not assert anything about Riemann integrability; it asserts a closure property for an arbitrary predicate RiemannIntegrableOn under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication, assuming R satisfies an arbitrary predicate IsClosedRectangle. This is not a faithful formalization of the statement.

3) Final check: are they the same?
- Differences:
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s notion of a closed rectangle; it introduces an arbitrary predicate IsClosedRectangle instead.
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s notion of Riemann integrability (over a rectangle/box); it introduces an arbitrary predicate RiemannIntegrableOn instead.
  - Because these are arbitrary, the theorem is content-free with respect to the intended mathematical concepts; it is not the same statement.
  - The presence of sorry in the theorem is acceptable for the auditing task (we don’t require proofs), but the key issue is the use of placeholder predicates rather than actual Mathlib definitions.
- Conclusion: Not faithful.

Grade rationale: The statement shape (closure under scalar multiplication, addition, multiplication) matches the intended algebraic property, and the domain (ℝ^n as Fin n → ℝ) is appropriate; if the placeholders were replaced with the correct Mathlib notions, the statement would be faithful. However, as-is, it uses arbitrary predicates instead of the real ones, so it fails the faithfulness requirement. This fits the rubric for 6: makes up vacuous/placeholder definitions but, if fixed, the final statement would be faithful.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim concerns: a closed rectangle R in R^n with one side length 0 (so effectively lower-dimensional), every bounded function f: R → ℝ is Riemann integrable on R, and the integral over R equals 0. Faithful translation would involve defining a closed rectangle with a degenerate side, stating boundedness, Riemann integrability, and the integral being 0. The provided Lean code does none of this: no definitions of rectangles, no function f, no integrability, no integral, and no theorem expressing the stated result.

The two statements are completely different. The Lean code proves `True`, which is unrelated. There are no auxiliary definitions; however, the absence of any relevant content means it does not even attempt the translation.

This is precisely uniform convergence on each symmetric compact interval [−k, k].

  Translation: If each f_n is continuous and the sequence f_n converges uniformly to f on each [−k, k], then f is continuous on ℝ. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is exactly the intended content.

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful to the original statement?
- The natural language defines uniform convergence on compact subsets via uniform convergence on each [−k, k] for k ∈ ℕ. The Lean definition conv_uniform_on_compacts matches this exactly using Icc (−k) k.
- The theorem in Lean states: if each f_n is continuous and f_n → f uniformly on compact sets (as defined), then f is continuous. This matches the natural language statement “Prove that if f_n are continuous and converge uniformly on compact subsets, then the limit is continuous on ℝ.”
- The code parameterizes the limit as a function f and asserts its continuity under the uniform convergence assumption, matching the phrase “the limit is continuous.”

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No vacuous placeholders: conv_uniform_on_compacts is a genuine definition, not set to True or similar.
- The use of [-k, k] via Icc (−(k:ℝ)) (k:ℝ) is correct and faithful.
- The theorem assumes continuity of each f_n and the uniform convergence on those intervals; it concludes f is continuous. This is exactly the statement.
- While Mathlib has general notions like TendstoUniformlyOn, the custom definition is legitimate and matches the provided natural language definition. No mismatch in quantifiers or domains.
- No auxiliary, misleading, or incorrect definitions.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- `(r : ℝ) (hr : r > 0)`: There exists a positive real number r > 0.
- `(hconv : ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z < r → Summable fun k => a k * z ^ k)`: For every complex z with |z| < r, the series ∑ a_k z^k is summable (i.e., convergent). This encodes that the power series has a positive radius of convergence.
- `(z : ℕ → ℂ)`: A sequence (z_n) of complex numbers.
- `(hz_nonzero : ∀ n, z n ≠ 0)`: Each z_n is nonzero.

- `: ∀ k, a k = 0`: The conclusion is that all coefficients a_k are zero.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: f(z) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ a_k z^k is a convergent power series (i.e., has positive radius of convergence), {z_n} is a sequence of nonzero complex numbers converging to 0, and f(z_n) = 0 for all n. Show that a_k = 0 for all k.
- The Lean hypotheses exactly encode: positive radius r and convergence (hconv), sequence nonzero (hz_nonzero), convergence to 0 (hz_lim), and f(z_n) = 0 via the tsum equality (hz_root). The conclusion matches exactly.
- Use of `Summable` and `tsum` is appropriate Mathlib terminology. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present. The theorem does not introduce auxiliary definitions. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the task since we are only checking translation, not proof.
- Slight nuance: `tsum` is defined even when not summable, but the hypothesis `hconv` together with `hz_lim` ensures that for all sufficiently large n, the series is summable at z_n. The natural language assumes f is given by the power series, and asserting f(z_n) = 0 for all n is stronger than needed but consistent (it implies each z_n lies in the disk of convergence, or otherwise the equality is interpreted via `tsum`). This does not harm faithfulness; it matches the stated assumptions “for all n, f(z_n) = 0.”

Final check:
- Both problems assert the same mathematical content: under the given assumptions on a power series and a sequence of nonzero zeros accumulating at 0, all coefficients vanish. No mismatches detected.

- variable (R : Set X) (f g : X → ℝ): R is a set in X; f and g are functions on X. In the NL statement, f, g : R → ℝ (functions on the rectangle). In Mathlib one often models this as functions X → ℝ restricted to R, so this could be acceptable if everything else were set up properly.

The proof is omitted via sorry.

Assessment vs the natural language statement:
- Ambient space mismatch: The NL statement is explicitly about R ⊆ ℝ^n a closed rectangle. The Lean code generalizes to an arbitrary type X with no structure. This loses the intended setting (in particular, the notion of outer measure zero depends on ℝ^n and its Lebesgue outer measure).
- Use of placeholders instead of Mathlib notions: RiemannIntegrable_on, RiemannIntegral, and outer_measure_zero are completely uninterpreted parameters, not Mathlib definitions. This is a major red flag per the guidelines.
- Closedness of E: The NL statement assumes E is closed with outer measure zero. The code introduces E_closed : Prop, but it is not tied to E (it does not express IsClosed E) and is not used in the theorem. Thus the “closed” hypothesis is not faithfully represented.
- Closed rectangle R: The code does not state or use that R is a closed rectangle (or even closed). This assumption is completely omitted.
- Domain of f,g: The NL states f,g : R → ℝ, while the code has f,g : X → ℝ and integrates over a set R. This can be an acceptable modeling choice, but only if the rest is correctly formalized; here it is not.
- Proof omitted (sorry): While the task allows omission of proofs, the translation must use legitimate Mathlib terms. Using arbitrary placeholders and sorry makes the statement vacuous and not a faithful formalization.

Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean statement is about arbitrary type X and arbitrary predicates/functions named “RiemannIntegrable_on,” “RiemannIntegral,” and “outer_measure_zero,” with no connection to Riemann integration or Lebesgue outer measure on ℝ^n. It does not encode that E is closed, nor that R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Grade justification:
- Multiple severe issues: vacuous placeholders for key notions, ambient space mismatch, missing/unused “E is closed” hypothesis, and no encoding of “R is a closed rectangle.” Even if the placeholders were replaced, the current statement omits the closedness of E and the closed-rectangle structure on R. Hence, it fails the fidelity requirement. Assigning grade 3 to reflect that it makes up vacuous definitions and the final theorem would still not be faithful as written.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable {n m : ℕ}`: Work with natural numbers n, m.
- `theorem linear_map_differentiable_and_fderiv (A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ...`: Let A be a continuous linear map from (Fin n → ℝ) to (Fin m → ℝ) and x a point in the domain. The statement to prove is: `DifferentiableAt ℝ (A : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin m → ℝ)) x ∧ fderiv ℝ (A : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin m → ℝ)) x = A`. In words: the underlying function of A is differentiable at x and its Fréchet derivative at x equals A (as a continuous linear map).

2) Assessing fidelity to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For a linear map A: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, A is differentiable at every x and DA(x) = A (as a linear map).
- The Lean code models ℝ^n and ℝ^m as `Fin n → ℝ` and `Fin m → ℝ`, which is standard and acceptable.
- The code assumes A is a `ContinuousLinearMap` rather than merely a `LinearMap`. In finite-dimensional real vector spaces, every linear map is continuous, so this is an equivalent formulation in this setting. Thus no loss of generality.
- The result states differentiability at an arbitrary x (parameterized) and that the Fréchet derivative equals A; this matches the intended meaning (the derivative is the same map at every point).
- The equality is stated in the type of continuous linear maps (`fderiv` returns a `ContinuousLinearMap`), which is appropriate and consistent with the parenthetical “as a linear map”.

  For any natural number n, any open set U in (Fin n → ℝ) (i.e., ℝ^n), and any function f : ℝ^n → ℝ that is continuous on U, the Lebesgue measure (volume) in ((Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ) (i.e., ℝ^{n+1}) of the set `{p : (Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ | p.1 ∈ U ∧ p.2 = f p.1}` equals 0.
- The set `{p : (Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ | p.1 ∈ U ∧ p.2 = f p.1}` is precisely the graph of f over U, i.e., `{(x, f x) | x ∈ U}` viewed as a subset of ℝ^{n+1}.
- `IsOpen U` matches “U is open.”
- `ContinuousOn f U` matches “f is continuous on U.” Note that in Lean f is defined on all of ℝ^n but only required to be continuous on U; this is a standard formalization of a function whose domain is a subset U.
- `MeasureTheory.volume` is the Lebesgue measure on the ambient space ((Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ) ≅ ℝ^{n+1}.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The mathematical objects match exactly: U ⊆ ℝ^n open; f : U → ℝ continuous is formalized as f : ℝ^n → ℝ with `ContinuousOn f U`; the graph G = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈ U} ⊆ ℝ^{n+1}; and the conclusion is that G has Lebesgue measure zero in ℝ^{n+1}, written as `volume G = 0`.
- The slight formal difference that f is a total function on ℝ^n with continuity only on U is standard and faithful: any f : U → ℝ can be extended arbitrarily outside U and the set in question only evaluates f on points of U. Thus there is no change in meaning.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms are standard Mathlib concepts (IsOpen, ContinuousOn, volume, product space), and the set used is exactly the graph.

Final check: The two statements are mathematically the same. No discrepancies found.

  This defines a predicate harmonic_on f U, but it is set to True for all f and U. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not encode harmonicity (twice continuously differentiable with Laplacian zero) at all.

  Natural language: Let U ⊆ ℝ² be open and connected, f : ℝ² → ℝ, assume hf: f is harmonic on U (according to harmonic_on), p ∈ U, and f(x) ≤ f(p) for all x ∈ U (so p is a maximizer on U). Then f is constant on U (f x = f p for all x ∈ U). 
  Note: f is defined on ℝ² rather than U, but the statement only concerns U and that is acceptable as a translation provided harmonic_on is a correct predicate for being harmonic on U.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement
Original: U is a connected open subset of ℝ²; f : U → ℝ is harmonic (C² with f_xx + f_yy = 0 on U). If f attains a maximum at some p ∈ U, then f is constant on U.
Lean: Matches the topology assumptions (IsOpen U, IsConnected U), encodes “attains a maximum at p” as ∀ x ∈ U, f x ≤ f p, and concludes f is constant on U. Domain minor difference (f defined on ℝ² rather than U) is fine semantically if harmonic_on f U correctly means “f is harmonic on U.”
Critical issue: harmonic_on is defined as True, a vacuous placeholder. This means the theorem as written does not assume harmonicity at all; it claims any function attaining a maximum on a connected open set is constant, which is not the intended statement. Thus the translation is not faithful.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness
- The main mismatch is the vacuous auxiliary definition harmonic_on := True, which fails to capture the harmonic hypothesis. This violates the guidelines and changes the meaning of the theorem.
- Other aspects (openness, connectedness, maximum condition, and constancy conclusion) are correctly represented.
- No other auxiliary vacuous definitions are present, and the rest of the structure is reasonable.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous definition of harmonic_on. If harmonic_on were properly defined to capture harmonicity (e.g., C² and Laplacian zero on U), the theorem statement would be faithful.

- `(h_bound : ∃ M:ℝ, ∀ n, |(Finset.range (n+1)).sum (fun i => x i)| ≤ M)` states: there exists a real M such that for all n, the partial sums of x from i = 0 to n are bounded in absolute value by M. This is the bounded-partial-sums hypothesis for the series of x_n (with index starting at 0).
- `(hseq : Tendsto seq atTop (nhds (0 : ℝ)))` says: λ_n → 0 as n → ∞.
- `(hvar : Summable fun n => |seq (n+1) - seq n|)` says: the series ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges.
- Conclusion: `Summable fun n => seq n * x n` i.e. the series ∑ λ_n x_n converges (not necessarily absolutely).

- Natural statement: Let ∑ x_n be a series with bounded partial sums, λ_n → 0, and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges. Show that ∑ λ_n x_n converges.
- The hypotheses match exactly: bounded partial sums of x_n, λ_n → 0, and summability of the total variation of λ_n. The conclusion is convergence of ∑ λ_n x_n.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: The Lean code uses sums from 0 to n (`Finset.range (n+1)`), whereas the natural language uses n starting at 1. Boundedness of partial sums and convergence of a series are unaffected by a finite shift of indices, so this is logically equivalent and acceptable.
- Type: The Lean code works over ℝ. The natural language uses absolute values and products of real sequences implicitly; using ℝ is consistent.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The proof is omitted (by `sorry`), which is allowed for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- noncomputable section / open Finset: housekeeping; no mathematical content.
- def f (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x / (1 + (↑n * x) ^ 2)
  This defines f_n(x) = x / (1 + (n x)^2) on ℝ. This matches the natural-language f_n.

  This defines g_n(x) as a finite sum over k = 0..n-1 of 2^{-(k+1)} f_n(x - a_{k+1}). After reindexing j = k+1, this is exactly sum_{j=1}^n 2^{-j} f_n(x - a_j). The coercion (a (k+1) : ℝ) turns rationals into reals, consistent with the statement.
- theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_seq_funcs_1442 (a : ℕ → ℚ) : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : ℝ, |g a n x| ≤ ε := by sorry
  This states uniform convergence of g_n to 0 on ℝ, in the usual ε–N form (|g_n(x)| ≤ ε eventually uniformly in x). The proof is omitted, which is fine for translation checking.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement fixes an enumeration {a_k} of the rational numbers and defines g_n using that specific enumeration, then asks to show g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ.
- The Lean theorem quantifies over an arbitrary sequence a : ℕ → ℚ, with no condition that a enumerates (i.e., is surjective onto) ℚ. This is strictly stronger than the original requirement (it covers all sequences, not just enumerations). The docstring mentions “an enumeration of ℚ,” but the type and theorem do not enforce or assume this property.
- All other aspects match: the definitions of f_n and g_n (including indexing and the weights 2^{-k}) and the meaning of uniform convergence to 0 are correct.

Final check: same or different?
- Different in a material way: the Lean statement asserts uniform convergence for every sequence a : ℕ → ℚ, whereas the original requires it only for sequences that enumerate ℚ. Since the audit demands a faithful translation (not merely a stronger statement), this mismatch means the translation is not faithful.

No vacuous placeholders: f and g are meaningful definitions; the theorem has a sorry but that is acceptable for translation purposes.

Grade rationale: Almost perfect except for the crucial quantifier mismatch about “enumeration.” Hence, not faithful; assign 9.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language
- We work in Mathlib with sets and metric structures.
- Variable n : ℕ, and interpret ℝ^n as the type (Fin n → ℝ).
- The theorem taylor_remainder_order_two_uniform_on_compact states:
  Hypotheses:
  • U ⊆ ℝ^n is convex (hU : Convex ℝ U).
  • f : ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2 on U (hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U).
  Conclusion:
  For every compact K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h ∈ ℝ^n with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ, we have
  | f(x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (λ y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here, fderiv ℝ f x is the Fréchet derivative of f at x, and fderiv ℝ (λ y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the derivative (as a bounded linear map) of the derivative map at x, which is the second derivative; applied to h and then to h it yields the bilinear evaluation D^2 f(x)[h, h]. The 1/2 factor gives the usual 2nd-order Taylor polynomial. The quantifiers express uniformity in x over K (δ depends only on ε and K). The additional condition x + h ∈ U ensures the evaluation point stays in the set where f is assumed C^2.

Step 2: Does this match the natural language statement?
- The NL statement: “Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 and H_f continuous in a convex set U. Show that the remainder in the Taylor approximation of order 2 is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.”
- Assumptions: The Lean hypothesis ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U matches “f is C^2 on U,” which implies that the Hessian (i.e., the second derivative) is continuous on U. The NL phrase also mentions the Hessian is continuous in U, which is encompassed by ContDiffOn ℝ 2.
- Conclusion: The Lean conclusion is an ε–δ formulation of “the remainder is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U,” with a standard Taylor remainder form using the gradient and the Hessian (via second Fréchet derivative) at x, uniform in x ∈ K. The requirement x + h ∈ U is a natural domain condition that is typically implicit in the informal statement.
- The norm: The code uses the default norm on (Fin n → ℝ), which is the sup norm, whereas in mathematics “‖·‖” usually denotes the Euclidean norm. Since all norms on finite-dimensional spaces are equivalent, the little-o statement is invariant under equivalent norms, so this is not a substantive mismatch.

Step 3: Differences and issues
- Key subtlety: The code uses the global derivatives fderiv ℝ f x and fderiv ℝ (λ y => fderiv ℝ f y) x, whereas the assumption is only ContDiffOn on the set U (not necessarily open). In Mathlib, ContDiffOn on a non-open set yields differentiability within U (fderivWithin), not necessarily differentiability at x as a function on all of ℝ^n. The expressions fderiv ℝ f x and the second derivative are globally defined objects that evaluate to 0 by definition if differentiabilityAt fails; thus the statement as written could compute the “derivatives” as 0 at boundary points where only within-differentiability is guaranteed, leading to a potentially incorrect Taylor polynomial in those cases.
- The natural language formulation, by saying “f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 … in a convex set U,” is typically taken to mean f is twice continuously differentiable at each point of U in the usual (global) sense, i.e., differentiable in a neighborhood of each point in U; in standard analysis texts this effectively means U is open (or at least that the derivatives are understood as global derivatives at those points). The Lean statement does not assume U is open and does not switch to within-derivatives; hence there is a mismatch at boundary points of U.
- Therefore, to be fully faithful, either U should be assumed open (so ContDiffOn implies ContDiffAt and fderiv agrees with the within derivative), or the statement should use fderivWithin consistently for both first and second derivatives. As it stands, the quantification over K ⊆ U allows K to meet ∂U, and the theorem still uses global derivatives at those boundary points, which is not what the NL statement necessarily asserts under the given hypotheses.
- Minor: The NL statement mentions the Hessian H_f explicitly; the Lean uses the second Fréchet derivative to encode it, which is acceptable and mathematically equivalent under the intended assumptions.

Final check
- The only substantive mismatch is the use of global derivatives without assuming U is open (or using within derivatives). This can change the meaning at boundary points, making the Lean statement not perfectly faithful to the intended mathematical statement. Everything else aligns well, including convexity, uniformity on compact subsets, and the second-order Taylor remainder with a 1/2 factor.

Given the instruction to be extra harsh, I must mark it as not fully faithful due to the global vs within derivative issue.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- open Set: We will use notations from Set.
- theorem exists_finite_closed_rectangles_covering {n : ℕ} (U S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : ...: We are working in R^n modeled as functions Fin n → ℝ. U and S are subsets of R^n.
- Hypotheses: IsOpen U → IsCompact S → S ⊆ U → ...: Assume U is open, S is compact, and S is contained in U.
- Conclusion: ∃ (k : ℕ) (a b : Fin k → Fin n → ℝ), ...: There exists a natural number k and two functions a, b assigning to each rectangle index j : Fin k and each coordinate i : Fin n two real numbers a j i and b j i.
- (∀ j i, a j i ≤ b j i): Each coordinate’s lower endpoint is ≤ its upper endpoint; so each coordinate defines a closed interval [a j i, b j i].
- (∀ j, (Set.pi (univ : Set (Fin n)) fun i => Set.Icc (a j i) (b j i)) ⊆ U): For each j, the product set ∏_{i∈Fin n} [a j i, b j i] is contained in U. These are closed axis-aligned rectangles inside U.
- S ⊆ (⋃ j : Fin k, Set.pi (univ : Set (Fin n)) fun i => Set.Icc (a j i) (b j i)): The union of these k closed rectangles covers S.
- (∀ (j l : Fin k), j ≠ l → interior (rectangle j) ∩ interior (rectangle l) = ∅): The interiors of the rectangles are pairwise disjoint.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original statement: Let U ⊂ R^n be open and S ⊂ U be a compact Jordan measurable set. Then there exist finitely many closed rectangles P_1, ..., P_k contained in U such that S ⊂ ⋃_{j=1}^k P_j and their interiors are mutually disjoint: P_j^∘ ∩ P_ℓ^∘ = ∅ for j ≠ ℓ.

The Lean statement matches the structure precisely:
- Ambient space R^n represented as Fin n → ℝ: correct.
- U open: IsOpen U.
- S ⊆ U: present.
- S compact: IsCompact S.
- Closed rectangles as products of closed intervals [a j i, b j i], with a ≤ b: present.
- Finitely many rectangles: indexed by Fin k for some k : ℕ.
- Each rectangle contained in U: present.
- Cover S by union of the rectangles: present.
- Pairwise disjoint interiors: present, via interior intersection equals empty set for j ≠ l.

Step 3: Identify differences and issues.
- The original statement assumes S is a compact Jordan measurable set. The Lean code assumes only IsCompact S (compactness) and does not mention Jordan measurability at all. This makes the Lean statement strictly stronger (it covers all compact sets, not only compact Jordan measurable sets). While mathematically that may be fine (Jordan measurability imposes extra conditions not used here), as a translation it omits a stated hypothesis of the original problem.
- Aside from that omission, the representation of rectangles, finiteness, inclusion in U, coverage of S, and disjointness of interiors all align correctly with the original.
- No auxiliary vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions (Set.pi, Icc, interior, IsOpen, IsCompact), so no red flags there.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is a stronger statement than the original because it drops the “Jordan measurable” hypothesis. Under the auditor’s strictness requirement, this is not a faithful translation of the given statement, even though it implies the original.

Grade justification: Almost identical except for omitting the Jordan measurability assumption, so it is not faithful but very close. Hence a high but not passing score.

- In Mathlib, Matrix.adjugate is the classical adjoint, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Thus, the code’s hypothesis B = A.adjugate means B is the adjugate, not the cofactor matrix itself. The natural statement explicitly says B is the matrix of cofactors, not its transpose.
- While the conclusion det(B) = det(A)^(n-1) holds for both the cofactor matrix and its transpose (since det is invariant under transpose), the Lean statement is not literally the same hypothesis: it assumes B equals the adjugate, rather than B equals the cofactor matrix.
- Everything else (ambient ring, dimension as Fintype.card n, the exponent n-1 represented as Fintype.card n - 1) aligns well.

3) Final check:
- The two problems are extremely close but not identical: the Lean code asserts the result for B = adjugate(A), whereas the natural language asserts it for B = cofactor_matrix(A). Without an explicit identification of adjugate with the transpose of the cofactor matrix (and using det(B) = det(Bᵀ)), this is a mismatch in the hypothesis. Given the instruction to be extra harsh, this counts as not faithful, though it is very close.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the only issue is the mismatch between “cofactor matrix” and “adjugate”.

  This states: If ∑ |a_n| and ∑ |b_n| are summable (i.e., both series are absolutely convergent), then (i) the Cauchy product series ∑ c_n is summable (i.e., convergent), and (ii) the sum of the Cauchy product equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n). No proof provided.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
The NL statement: Given ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n are absolutely convergent, show that ∑ c_n defined by c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} converges absolutely and that ∑ c_n = (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- Hypotheses match: The Lean theorem assumes absolute convergence of a and b via Summable (|a n|) and Summable (|b n|).
- Definition of c_n matches via cauchy_prod using ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}.
- Conclusion mismatch: The NL statement demands absolute convergence of the Cauchy product, i.e., Summable (fun n => |(cauchy_prod a b) n|). The Lean statement only asserts Summable (cauchy_prod a b), which is plain convergence, not absolute convergence. This is strictly weaker.
- The equality of sums is correctly stated: tsum (cauchy_prod a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b).
- Domain: Lean specializes to ℝ. The NL statement is ambiguous about the field; specialization to ℝ is acceptable as a faithful special case.

3) Final check: The two problems are not the same because the Lean theorem omits the requirement that the Cauchy product converges absolutely. Everything else aligns. No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition cauchy_prod is legitimate. The theorem statement otherwise uses standard Mathlib notions. Therefore, the translation is almost correct but fails on the absolute convergence clause.

- import Mathlib: Brings in mathlib, but nothing specific is used.
- def Riemann_integrable_on (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “f is Riemann integrable on [a,b]”, but it is defined as True, i.e., vacuous.
- def Riemann_integral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0: Introduces a placeholder function returning the Riemann integral of f over [a,b], but it always returns 0, i.e., vacuous.
- def Uniform_on (f_n : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate for uniform convergence on [a,b], but it is defined as True, i.e., vacuous.
- theorem uniform_limit_of_riemann_integrable ...: States: If (1) for all n, Riemann_integrable_on (f_n n) a b holds, and (2) Uniform_on f_n f a b holds, then (i) Riemann_integrable_on f a b holds and (ii) Tendsto (fun n => Riemann_integral (f_n n) a b) atTop (pure (Riemann_integral f a b)). This mirrors the structure of the intended theorem, with limits expressed using filter notation. The proof is left as sorry.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The intended statement: If f_n : [a,b] → ℝ are Riemann integrable and f_n → f uniformly on [a,b], then f is Riemann integrable and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n.
- The Lean theorem’s logical shape matches: hypotheses of integrability on [a,b], uniform convergence on [a,b], conclusion of integrability of limit and convergence of integrals to the integral of the limit (encoded via Tendsto to a Dirac/pure measure). However, the key predicates and functions (Riemann integrability, Riemann integral, uniform convergence) are defined as vacuous or trivial (True, 0), not mathlib’s actual concepts. Thus the statement is not a faithful translation, as the hypotheses and conclusion are meaningless within these placeholders.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Major difference: All auxiliary definitions are vacuous placeholders: Riemann_integrable_on = True, Riemann_integral = 0, Uniform_on = True. This violates the guidelines, making the theorem trivial and not representing the intended notions.
- Secondary note: The use of Tendsto (fun n => Riemann_integral ...) atTop (pure (Riemann_integral f ...)) would be a correct formalization of lim ∫ f_n = ∫ f if the integral were the real one. So structurally it matches, but because of the placeholders, it fails.
- Also, the proof is sorry, which is acceptable for checking statement faithfulness, but the vacuous definitions alone cause failure.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to vacuous auxiliary definitions. If those were replaced by proper mathlib notions (e.g., a proper Riemann integral or Lebesgue integral with appropriate assumptions and TendstoUniformlyOn), the statement would be faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem `power_series_differentiable_on` is stated for real coefficients `c : ℕ → ℝ`, center `a : ℝ`, and a radius `ρ : ℝ` with `hρ : 0 < ρ`.
- `f : ℝ → ℝ` is a real function.
- Hypothesis `hsum`: For every `x` with `|x - a| < ρ`, the series `∑ c n * (x - a)^n` has sum `f x` (written via `HasSum`). So f agrees pointwise with the power series on the open ball of radius ρ.
- Hypothesis `hsum'`: For every `x` with `|x - a| < ρ`, the derived series `∑ (n+1) * c (n+1) * (x - a)^n` is summable.
- Conclusion: `f` is differentiable on the open set `{x | |x - a| < ρ}`, and for every `x` with `|x - a| < ρ`, `deriv f x` equals the sum `tsum` of the derived series at `x`.
- The proof is omitted with `sorry` (which is allowed but means there is no proof; we only audit the statement).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement: For a power series ∑ c_n (x−a)^n with radius of convergence 0 < ρ ≤ ∞, on the interval I = {x | |x − a| < ρ}, let f be its sum. Then f is differentiable and f'(x) = ∑ (n+1)c_{n+1}(x−a)^n, with radius of convergence equal to ρ.

Matches:
- The Lean theorem asserts differentiability of f on the open ball `{x | |x - a| < ρ}` and gives the derivative as the termwise differentiated series. This aligns with the core differentiation claim.
- The hypotheses encode that f equals the series on that domain via `HasSum`.

Mismatches / Red flags:
- The Lean theorem assumes an extra hypothesis `hsum'` that the derived series is summable for all x with |x − a| < ρ. In the original statement, the summability of the derived series on the same domain (equivalently, that its radius of convergence is at least ρ) is part of the conclusion, not an assumption. This shifts a key part of the theorem into a hypothesis.
- The Lean statement does not assert anything about the radius of convergence of the derived series, especially not that it is equal to ρ. The original explicitly states that the derived series has the same radius ρ.
- The Lean statement does not formalize the notion that ρ is the radius of convergence of the original series; it merely takes a positive real ρ for which the series sums to f on the open ball. There is no claim that ρ is the exact radius (it could be any positive number within the actual radius). The original states that ρ is the radius of convergence.
- The original allows ρ = ∞ (i.e., entire series), whereas the Lean code treats ρ as a real number with 0 < ρ, thus excluding the infinite radius case.
- Domain typing difference (f : I → ℝ vs f : ℝ → ℝ) is a benign formalization choice since the Lean conclusion is restricted to the set {x | |x - a| < ρ}.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem captures the differentiability and derivative formula on the open ball, but only under an extra summability hypothesis for the derived series, and it omits the crucial claim that the derived series has the same radius of convergence as the original (and that this radius is ρ). It also excludes the ρ = ∞ case. Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the original theorem.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X is a type with a MetricSpace structure; K is a subset of X.
- Hypothesis: hK : IsCompact K (K is compact), ε : ℝ with εpos : 0 < ε.
- Conclusion: ∃ s : Finset X, K ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ s, Metric.ball x ε.
  This asserts that for every ε > 0, there exists a finite set s of points in X such that K is contained in (i.e., covered by) the union of open ε-balls centered at the points of s.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Prove that K is the union of finitely many open balls of radius ε, for every ε > 0.”
- The Lean statement gives K ⊆ ⋃_{x ∈ s} ball(x, ε), i.e., K is covered by finitely many ε-balls. It does not assert equality K = ⋃_{x ∈ s} ball(x, ε).
- The phrase “is the union of finitely many open balls” literally means equality, which is strictly stronger and generally false unless K is open or the balls are chosen to lie within K. The standard compactness result indeed gives a finite cover, not an exact union equality.

Final check:
- The Lean code formalizes the finite cover conclusion, not the equality “is the union.” Thus, there is a mismatch if we take the natural language literally. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the Mathlib concepts (IsCompact, Metric.ball) are standard and appropriate.
- Therefore, while the Lean theorem captures the standard intended meaning (“can be covered by finitely many ε-balls”), it is not a faithful translation of the literal statement “is the union of.”

- Conclusion: DifferentiableAt ℝ f c ∧ deriv f c = L, i.e., f is differentiable at c and f′(c) = L.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- NL statement: f is a function (a, b) → ℝ, continuous on (a, b), differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}. Assume lim_{x→c} f′(x) = L exists (limit along x ≠ c in (a, b)). Conclude f is differentiable at c and f′(c) = L.
- The Lean statement models f as ℝ → ℝ but only assumes behavior on (a, b); since (a, b) is open and c ∈ (a, b), this is acceptable for a local statement.
- However, the key difference is the limit formulation: the Lean code assumes Tendsto (deriv f) (nhds c) (nhds L), i.e., the limit along the full neighborhood filter at c. This implies in particular that deriv f c = L (since for nhds c, tendsto enforces the value at c), i.e., continuity of deriv f at c with value L.
- The NL statement assumes the punctured limit of f′(x) exists as x → c (i.e., x ≠ c, and within (a, b)). It does not assume or require any value for f′ at c (indeed f′ at c is not known a priori), and the correct filter expression would be Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) (𝓝[≠] c) (𝓝 L) (or nhdsWithin c ((Ioo a b) \ {c})).

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
- Different. The Lean hypothesis is strictly stronger than the NL assumption because it uses nhds c rather than the punctured filter 𝓝[≠] c. Using nhds c forces deriv f c = L upfront (continuity of deriv at c), which the NL statement does not assume. Although (a, b) being open means restricting to (a, b) vs ℝ is harmless, the non-punctured vs punctured limit is a real mismatch.
- No vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary assumptions are meaningful and use Mathlib concepts correctly. The mismatch is solely the limit filter.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- Comment explains the goal: translate the classical real-analysis statement to filters: if f tends to L along nhdsWithin c S, then a * f tends to a * L along the same filter.

The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is allowed per the instructions.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: S ⊆ ℝ, c is a cluster point of S, f : S → ℝ and g : S → ℝ, a ∈ ℝ, with f(x) → L and g(x) → M as x → c. Conclusion: a f(x) → a L as x → c.
- The Lean theorem captures the core claim using filters: “limit of f along nhdsWithin c S equals L” implies “limit of a*f along nhdsWithin c S equals a*L.” This is precisely the mathematical content of “as x → c within S, f(x) → L implies a f(x) → a L.”
- The use of `nhdsWithin c S` faithfully represents “as x → c with x in S.”
- Using multiplication `a * f x` matches “a f(x).”

3) Differences and their impact:
- Domain of f: NL has f : S → ℝ; Lean uses f : ℝ → ℝ with the within-filter `nhdsWithin c S`. This is the conventional Mathlib way to express limits on a subset; it is logically equivalent to the NL statement once you consider restricting the domain to S or extending f to ℝ arbitrarily. This does not change the mathematical meaning.
- Cluster point hypothesis: The NL includes that c is a cluster point of S. The Lean statement does not require this hypothesis explicitly; the Tendsto hypothesis along `nhdsWithin c S` is sufficient and more general. The conclusion remains valid without assuming cluster point; the code’s statement (assume convergence along the within filter) is not weaker than the NL version and matches the intended content. This is a benign strengthening, not a mismatch of meaning for the claim proved.
- Presence of g and its limit M in the NL statement: These are extraneous to the particular conclusion and are correctly omitted in the Lean statement.
- Everything else (types, operations, constant a ∈ ℝ) matches.
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions (Tendsto, nhdsWithin, nhds). The proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the task constraints.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully captures the mathematical content of the NL claim about scaling a limit along S at c. Minor differences (domain of f, omission of the cluster point condition and of g) do not alter the meaning of the specific assertion and, if anything, make the Lean statement slightly more general while remaining faithful.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in Mathlib.
- Comment restates the natural language problem.
- `open Metric Set` opens namespaces for metric and set notation.
- The theorem `exists_finite_epsilon_net` states: For a type `X` with a `PseudoMetricSpace` structure and a subset `K : Set X` that is compact (`IsCompact K`), and for any real `ε` with `0 < ε`, there exists a finite set `S : Finset X` such that `K ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ (↑S : Set X), Metric.ball x ε`. In words, we can cover `K` by finitely many open ε-balls centered at the points of `S`.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: Let (X, d) be a metric space. If K ⊂ X is compact, then for every ε > 0 there exists a finite ε-net for K. A finite ε-net means a finite set of centers whose open ε-balls cover K.
- The Lean statement matches the core content: it quantifies over arbitrary ε > 0 and produces a finite set `S` whose open ε-balls cover K (exactly the ε-net condition expressed as `K ⊆ ⋃ ... ball x ε`).

Potential discrepancies:
1) Space structure: The code assumes `[PseudoMetricSpace X]` rather than `[MetricSpace X]`. This is a generalization (pseudometric allows distinct points at distance 0). It is stronger than the original claim, not weaker. Still, strictly speaking, it is not exactly the same hypothesis as “metric space.”
2) Location of centers: The statement does not explicitly require the ε-net to lie in K. The code likewise does not require `S ⊆ K`. Many texts define an ε-net for K as a subset of X (not necessarily contained in K), so the code’s version is reasonable. If the intended meaning was “finite ε-net in K,” the code is weaker. The original phrasing is ambiguous, so this is at most a minor deviation.
3) Use of open balls: The code uses open balls `Metric.ball x ε`, which is standard for ε-nets; this aligns with common definitions.
4) Quantification over ε: The theorem parameters `(ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε)` express “for every ε > 0,” which matches the statement.

Auxiliary definitions and placeholders:
- There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions. The proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing translation.

Final comparison:
- Mathematically, the Lean statement captures the existence of a finite ε-net covering K for every ε > 0. The only notable difference is the more general pseudometric assumption as opposed to metric. Given the instruction to be extra harsh and require the same statement, this is a slight mismatch. Otherwise, the translation is spot on.

Conclusion:
- Very close, but not exactly the same due to `[PseudoMetricSpace X]` vs `[MetricSpace X]`. I mark it as almost faithful.

  Natural language: Let x: ℕ → ℝ be a sequence. Assume x is monotone increasing (nondecreasing) (hmono : Monotone x). Let k ∈ ℕ. Assume the sequence converges to x k in ℝ, i.e., lim_{n→∞} x n = x k (hlim : Tendsto x atTop (nhds (x k))). Then for all n with n ≥ k, we have x n = x k.

Check against the original statement:
- Original: Let {x_n} be a convergent monotone sequence. Suppose there exists k ∈ ℕ such that lim x_n = x_k. Show x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k.
- Lean: Matches the limit condition and the conclusion exactly. It also explicitly works over ℝ and uses Tendsto to express convergence, which is faithful.

Differences / Issues:
- Monotonicity: The original says “monotone sequence”, which in standard mathematical usage means either nondecreasing or nonincreasing. The Lean assumption is specifically `Monotone x`, i.e., nondecreasing only. It does not cover the antitone (nonincreasing) case. This is a loss of generality compared to the natural language statement.
- Indexing: The original sequence is indexed from 1; the Lean code uses ℕ (starting at 0). This is a harmless difference—Lean’s conclusion is even slightly stronger in that it allows k = 0—but does not reduce faithfulness.
- Convergence: The original assumes convergence plus equality of the limit to x_k. The Lean code assumes exactly that the limit is x k via `Tendsto ... (nhds (x k))`. This is faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Final check: The Lean code proves the statement for nondecreasing sequences only, whereas the natural language statement typically covers both nondecreasing and nonincreasing monotone sequences. Thus the translation is almost exact but not fully faithful due to reduced generality.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Universe and structures:
  - 𝕜 is a nontrivially normed field; X and Y are normed additive commutative groups with norms compatible with a normed space structure over 𝕜. This is Mathlib’s standard setup for normed vector spaces (generalized to any nontrivially normed field, not just ℝ).
  - X →L[𝕜] Y denotes continuous (hence bounded) linear maps from X to Y.

- Theorem add_bounded (A B : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ∀ x, ‖(A + B) x‖ ≤ (‖A‖ + ‖B‖) * ‖x‖
  - Translation: If A and B are bounded (continuous) linear maps, then for all x ∈ X, the norm of (A + B) applied to x is bounded by (‖A‖ + ‖B‖) times ‖x‖. This states that A + B is bounded, with an explicit bound ‖A‖ + ‖B‖.

- Theorem smul_bounded (a : 𝕜) (A : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ∀ x, ‖(a • A) x‖ ≤ (‖a‖ * ‖A‖) * ‖x‖
  - Translation: For any scalar a and bounded linear map A, the scalar multiple a • A is bounded, with bound ‖a‖‖A‖.

- Theorem op_norm_nonneg (f : X →L[𝕜] Y) : 0 ≤ ‖f‖
  - Translation: The operator norm is nonnegative.

- Theorem op_norm_eq_zero_iff (f : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ‖f‖ = 0 ↔ f = 0
  - Translation: The operator norm vanishes exactly for the zero map (definiteness of the norm).

- Theorem op_norm_triangle (f g : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ‖f + g‖ ≤ ‖f‖ + ‖g‖
  - Translation: The operator norm satisfies the triangle inequality.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- NL1: If A, B are linear and bounded operators X → Y, then A + B is bounded.
  - Code: add_bounded matches this precisely (using continuous linear maps which are the standard representation of bounded linear maps in Mathlib).

- NL2: If α ∈ ℝ, then αA is bounded.
  - Code: smul_bounded matches this, and in fact generalizes α from ℝ to any 𝕜 (a nontrivially normed field). This generalization is acceptable and faithful.

- NL3: Show that ‖·‖_{L(X,Y)} is a norm on L(X,Y).
  - To show a function is a norm, one needs: nonnegativity, definiteness (‖f‖ = 0 ↔ f = 0), triangle inequality, and homogeneity ‖a • f‖ = ‖a‖ ‖f‖ for all scalars a.
  - Code provides: nonnegativity (op_norm_nonneg), definiteness (op_norm_eq_zero_iff), and triangle inequality (op_norm_triangle).
  - Missing: the homogeneity axiom for the operator norm, i.e., a theorem of the form ‖a • f‖ = ‖a‖ ‖f‖ (or at least the equality version; an inequality would only give a seminorm). The provided smul_bounded is a pointwise bound showing boundedness of a • A, not the homogeneity of the operator norm.
  - Therefore, the code does not fully capture “‖·‖ on L(X,Y) is a norm,” since one of the norm axioms is not stated.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: all entities are standard Mathlib concepts (ContinuousLinearMap, operator norm). Good.
- The code matches the first two parts of the NL statement and generalizes scalars (acceptable).
- The code is missing the homogeneity axiom required to conclude that the operator norm is a norm. Hence, the translation of the third part is incomplete and not faithful.

Conclusion: The translation fails to fully capture the last requirement. It is close but not faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The lemma is stated in the general setting of normed vector spaces E and F over ℝ (not just ℝ^n), with a convex set U ⊆ E.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : U is convex.
  - f : E → F.
  - h_diff : f is differentiable on U (Frechet differentiable at every point in U).
  - h_cont : the derivative map x ↦ fderiv ℝ f x (a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] F) is continuous on U.
- Conclusion:
  - For every compact set K ⊆ E with K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h ∈ E with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, we have
    ‖f (x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h‖ ≤ ε ‖h‖.
- This is exactly a uniform (in x ∈ K) little-o estimate of the linear approximation error with respect to ‖h‖, with the natural domain restriction that the increment keeps us in U so the derivative along the segment is within the set where it is known/continuous.

Step 2: Compare to the original natural language statement.
- Original statement (specialized to ℝ^n → ℝ^n): Let F be differentiable and suppose DF exists and is continuous on a convex set U. Show that ‖F(x+h) − F(x) − DF(x)h‖ = o(‖h‖) uniformly on compact subsets of U as h → 0.
- The Lean statement:
  - Generalizes from ℝ^n to arbitrary real normed spaces E, F, which is a standard valid generalization.
  - Assumes f is differentiable on U and f' is continuous on U, matching “DF exists and is continuous on U”.
  - Concludes: for each compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that uniformly in x ∈ K and for all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, the error ≤ ε ‖h‖. This is exactly the ε-δ formulation of “the error is o(‖h‖) uniformly on compact subsets of U as h → 0”. The explicit condition x + h ∈ U is the natural domain restriction ensuring the segment from x to x+h lies in U (used by standard proofs), and is consistent with f being only assumed differentiable and f' continuous on U.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only potential discrepancy is the explicit condition “x + h ∈ U” in the Lean statement. The natural language statement does not state this explicitly, but it is standard/implicit in such results when differentiability and continuity of the derivative are only assumed on U (especially when using the integral/mean value along the segment inside a convex U). Moreover, the uniformity is asserted on compact subsets K ⊆ U; without assuming U is open or K ⊆ interior(U), one cannot guarantee x + h ∈ U for all small h, so the Lean version’s conditional formulation is the precise one aligned with the given hypotheses. Thus there is no substantive mismatch.
- The generalization to arbitrary normed spaces is acceptable and strengthens the statement; it still implies the ℝ^n case.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all Mathlib notions (Convex, DifferentiableOn, ContinuousOn, fderiv, IsCompact) are standard. The lemma ends with `by sorry`, but per the instructions, only the statement’s faithfulness is evaluated.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement (indeed in a slightly more general setting) with an appropriate and standard domain condition.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports Mathlib and opens ContinuousLinearMap: standard, fine.
- Variables: 𝕜 is a nontrivially normed field; E and F are normed 𝕜-vector spaces. This matches the setting of normed vector spaces over a normed field.
- The theorem statement:
  - Input: L : E ≃L[𝕜] F, i.e., L is a continuous linear equivalence (a bounded linear operator with a bounded inverse). This encodes “L is invertible and L^{-1} is bounded” (and in fact also that L itself is bounded, which is necessary to talk about ‖A − L‖).
  - Output: There exists δ > 0 such that for all A : E →L[𝕜] F (bounded linear operators) with ‖A − L.toContinuousLinearMap‖ < δ, there exists Ainv : F →L[𝕜] E with Ainv ∘ A = id_E and A ∘ Ainv = id_F, and with the bound ‖Ainv‖ ≤ ‖L.symm‖ / (1 − ‖L.symm‖ · ‖A − L‖). Here L.symm.toContinuousLinearMap is L^{-1}, and the product and difference in the denominator match the Neumann-series bound. This expresses that A is invertible (two-sided inverse given) and the desired norm bound on A^{-1} holds.
- There are no auxiliary placeholder definitions; the only “sorry” is the proof. All objects used are standard Mathlib notions: continuous linear maps and continuous linear equivalences.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement assumes L is invertible with bounded inverse between normed vector spaces. Lean encodes this as L : E ≃L F, which is the standard Mathlib structure for a bounded linear isomorphism; this is an appropriate and faithful formalization of the assumption.
- The NL conclusion: there exists δ > 0 such that if ‖A − L‖ < δ then A is invertible and ‖A^{-1}‖ ≤ ‖L^{-1}‖ / (1 − ‖L^{-1}‖ ‖A − L‖). The Lean theorem asserts exactly this for A a bounded linear operator, exhibits a bounded inverse Ainv with two-sided inverse properties (so A is invertible in the category of bounded operators), and gives the exact same norm bound. The dependence on δ is as in the NL statement.
- The mention “Use the Neumann series” is proof guidance, not part of the formal statement; the Lean code does not need to mention it.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domains/codomains: both are normed spaces over a normed field. OK.
- Nature of operators: The NL uses “linear operator,” but uses norms and ‖A − L‖, which implicitly requires boundedness; the Lean code explicitly works with continuous (bounded) linear maps. This is standard and faithful.
- Invertibility: Lean gives a two-sided inverse in the space of bounded operators, which implies invertibility as a linear operator; this matches and strengthens the NL’s “A is invertible.”
- Bound: The formula for ‖A^{-1}‖ matches exactly, with L.symm being L^{-1}. The positivity of the denominator is implicit in choosing δ small; neither statement separately asserts it, which is fine.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the NL statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem integral_operator_well_defined_and_linear takes k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ with hk : Continuous k. This assumes k is continuous on all of ℝ × ℝ.
- First conjunct (the ""well-definedness"" part):
  ∀ f, ContinuousOn f (Icc 0 1) →
    ContinuousOn (fun y => ∫ (over x with measure restricted to Icc 0 1) k (x, y) * f x) (Icc 0 1).
  In words: For any function f that is continuous on [0,1], the function y ↦ ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx is continuous on [0,1]. This matches the requirement that Lf lies in C([0,1], ℝ).
- Second conjunct (the linearity part):
  For all f, g : ℝ → ℝ with ContinuousOn f (Icc 0 1) and ContinuousOn g (Icc 0 1), and for all a, b : ℝ,
    the function y ↦ ∫_0^1 k(x,y) (a f(x) + b g(x)) dx equals the function y ↦ a ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx + b ∫_0^1 k(x,y) g(x) dx.
  In words: L(af + bg) = a L f + b L g (as functions of y), i.e., linearity.
- The integrals are Lebesgue integrals with respect to the restricted Lebesgue measure on [0,1]; the integrand depends on y through k(x,y).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The original statement: k : [0,1]^2 → ℝ is continuous; define L: C([0,1], ℝ) → C([0,1], ℝ) by (Lf)(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx. Show L is well-defined (Lf is continuous) and linear.
- The code’s first conjunct precisely states the well-definedness: if f is continuous on [0,1], then y ↦ ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx is continuous on [0,1].
- The code’s second conjunct states linearity with respect to f and g and scalars a, b.

Step 3: Check for mismatches or differences.
- Domain of k: The code assumes k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ is continuous, which is stronger than k : [0,1]^2 → ℝ continuous. This is a strengthening of hypotheses, not exactly the same as the original statement that only requires continuity on the square. Being extra harsh, that is a deviation.
- Domain/codomain types: The natural statement uses C([0,1], ℝ) explicitly. The code uses functions ℝ → ℝ with ContinuousOn on Icc 0 1 rather than the continuous-map type. Mathematically this is equivalent for the purposes here, but it’s not a literal translation into the ContinuousMap type.
- Scope of y: The linearity equality in the code is as functions ℝ → ℝ (i.e., for all y ∈ ℝ), whereas the natural statement only needs equality on y ∈ [0,1]. This is stronger than necessary but not harmful.
- Integration notion: The code uses Lebesgue integral over the restricted Lebesgue measure on [0,1]; the natural statement is framed as a (Riemann) integral. For continuous functions on [0,1] these coincide, so this is fine.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; it’s a clean statement-only theorem with sorry in the proof, which is permitted for our translation check.

Conclusion: The code captures the intended mathematical content: L maps continuous functions on [0,1] to continuous functions on [0,1] and is linear. However, it strengthens the hypothesis on k (global continuity on ℝ×ℝ instead of just on [0,1]^2) and does not use the ContinuousMap type C([0,1], ℝ). Given the instruction to be extra harsh about faithfulness, these differences mean it is not perfectly faithful, though it is very close.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem outer_measure_zero_of_approx_small {α : Type _} (m : Set α → ENNReal)`: We fix an arbitrary type α and a function m assigning to each subset of α a value in the extended nonnegative reals.
- `(mono : ∀ A B : Set α, A ⊆ B → m A ≤ m B)`: Hypothesis: m is monotone with respect to set inclusion.
- `(X : Set α)`: Fix a subset X of α.
- `(h : ∀ ε : ENNReal, 0 < ε → ∃ Y, X ⊆ Y ∧ m Y ≤ ε)`: Hypothesis: for every ε > 0 (in ENNReal), there exists a set Y with X ⊆ Y and m Y ≤ ε.
- Conclusion: `m X = 0`.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: α is ℝ^n; m is the outer measure m^* on ℝ^n; assumption: for every ε > 0 (real), there exists Y ⊇ X with m^*(Y) ≤ ε; conclusion: m^*(X) = 0.
- The Lean statement is a generalization: it holds for any type α and any monotone set function m: Set α → ENNReal. The assumption is the same form (approximation from above by arbitrarily small supersets), but quantified over ENNReal ε > 0 instead of real ε > 0. This is compatible with the outer measure context (outer measures naturally take values in ENNReal), and the real-version follows from the ENNReal-version by restriction. The conclusion matches: m X = 0.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Differences:
  - The code does not specifically require α = ℝ^n; it is stated for arbitrary α. This is a benign generalization since the argument uses only monotonicity.
  - The code does not use the OuterMeasure structure or name m^* explicitly; it assumes only monotonicity, which is a property satisfied by outer measures. No vacuous placeholders are introduced.
  - ε is taken in ENNReal rather than ℝ; this is standard in measure theory and compatible with the intended statement. The assumption is slightly stronger (all positive ENNReal ε rather than just positive reals), but it implies the intended case and does not distort the meaning.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions, and the theorem statement captures the core mathematical content: if a set can be covered by supersets of arbitrarily small outer measure (or any monotone m), then its measure is zero.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful in mathematical meaning, though presented in a more general and slightly different formal context. Given the instruction to be harsh, the lack of explicit OuterMeasure/ℝ^n is a mild mismatch, so I assign a 9 rather than 10.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The environment considers functions f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ, with U : Set (Fin n → ℝ). In mathlib, (Fin n → ℝ) is the type of n-tuples of real numbers with the default normed space structure (the pi/sup norm), not the Euclidean ℓ2 norm.
- hU : Convex ℝ U asserts U is convex.
- hcd : ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U asserts f is C^1 on U (continuously differentiable on U), which is a standard formalization and is at least as strong as “has continuous partial derivatives on U”.
- hM : ∀ x ∈ U, ‖(fderivWithin ℝ f U x)‖ ≤ M asserts that the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative of f (within U) at x is bounded by M for all x ∈ U.
- Conclusion: ∀ x y ∈ U, | f y − f x − (fderivWithin ℝ f U x) (y − x) | ≤ M * ‖y − x‖. This uses the linear approximation via the derivative: the linear map fderivWithin ℝ f U x applied to (y − x), and bounds the remainder by M times the norm of y − x.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement is about f : ℝ^n → ℝ with continuous partial derivatives on a convex set U, which matches the mathematical intent of ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U on U.
- The NL uses the gradient ∇f(x), the Euclidean dot product ∇f(x) · (y − x), and the Euclidean norm ‖∇f(x)‖ and ‖y − x‖. In mathlib, to model this faithfully, one typically uses EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) (or at least an InnerProductSpace structure giving the ℓ2 norm and associated identification of the derivative with the gradient via Riesz).
- The Lean code, however, uses the bare type (Fin n → ℝ), whose default norm is the sup (ℓ∞) norm, not the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm. Consequently:
  • The operator norm ‖fderivWithin … x‖ is the dual norm corresponding to the sup norm (which corresponds to an ℓ1 norm on the gradient when identifying finite-dimensional duals), not the Euclidean norm of the gradient.
  • The linear term (fderivWithin … x) (y − x) is a general continuous linear functional applied to y − x, not explicitly the dot product with the Euclidean gradient.
- Thus, while in Euclidean ℝ^n with the ℓ2 norm the operator norm of the derivative equals the Euclidean norm of the gradient and the functional equals the dot product with the gradient, the code does not impose the Euclidean structure; it uses a different normed structure. Therefore, the statement in Lean is not the same as the NL statement: it asserts a mean value inequality in a different norm (ℓ∞ on the domain), and does not mention nor enforce the dot product/gradient identification.
- Quantification over x, y ∈ U matches the intended scope.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different in a critical way: the NL statement is about Euclidean geometry (gradient, dot product, Euclidean norms), but the code works in (Fin n → ℝ) with its default norm and expresses the bound in terms of the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative and the sup norm of y − x. It does not ensure equivalence to the Euclidean version. Hence, the translation is not faithful.

Additional note: Even aside from the norm/gradient mismatch, the specific inequality claimed (with M rather than potentially 2M) is subtle and generally requires more than a mere bound on the gradient/derivative at all points if one subtracts ∇f(x) · (y − x); but since the audit is about translation, the decisive mismatch is the norm/inner product/gradient identification not encoded in the Lean statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The code works over a nontrivially normed field 𝕜, with X and Y normed vector spaces over 𝕜 (NormedAddCommGroup + NormedSpace). It additionally assumes X and Y are complete (CompleteSpace X, CompleteSpace Y), i.e., Banach spaces.
- A : X →L[𝕜] Y is a continuous (bounded) linear map.
- The theorem bounded_inverse_of_bijective states: If A is bijective as a function (Function.Bijective (A : X → Y)), then there exists a continuous linear map B : Y →L[𝕜] X which is a two-sided inverse of A as functions, i.e., B ∘ A = id_X (LeftInverse) and A ∘ B = id_Y (RightInverse).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: Let X and Y be normed vector spaces and A ∈ L(X,Y) a linear operator. If A is one-to-one and onto, then A^{-1} : Y → X is bounded. They suggest using the open mapping theorem; if not known, give a proof assuming completeness of X and Y.
- The Lean code assumes A is a bounded linear operator (X →L[𝕜] Y), exactly matching A ∈ L(X,Y).
- It assumes A is bijective and concludes there exists a bounded (continuous) linear map B that is the inverse of A. This exactly captures “A^{-1} is bounded.”
- The code assumes completeness of X and Y (Banach spaces), which is consistent with the alternative suggested in the problem statement (prove under completeness if not using the open mapping theorem). The code does not try to state a version without completeness; that’s acceptable because the problem explicitly allows a proof under completeness.
- The field 𝕜 is arbitrary nontrivially normed; the problem statement did not specify ℝ or ℂ. This is a mild generalization and does not distort the intended meaning of the statement.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced. The theorem statement itself is precise and matches the mathematical claim; the proof is omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 3: Final check: Are the statements the same?
- Yes. Both assert that a bijective bounded linear operator between normed spaces (in the code, Banach spaces) has a bounded inverse, encoded as existence of a continuous linear inverse B with B ∘ A = id and A ∘ B = id. The completeness assumption is present in the Lean code, aligning with the optional route proposed by the statement. No discrepancies.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib / open Set: Bring in Mathlib and open the Set namespace. OK.
- variable {n : ℕ} (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ): We work in ℝ^n represented as Fin n → ℝ. R is an arbitrary subset of ℝ^n. f is a function defined on all of ℝ^n (not just on R).
- variable (Riemann_integrable_on : (((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)): Introduce an arbitrary predicate taking a function and a set to a proposition; intended to stand for “f is Riemann integrable on R”, but it is just an uninterpreted symbol, not Mathlib’s notion.
- variable (integral_on : (((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)): Introduce an arbitrary function assigning a real number to a function and a set; intended to be the Riemann integral over R, but again just an uninterpreted symbol.
- variable (outer_measure_zero : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop): Introduce an arbitrary predicate on sets; intended to mean “outer measure zero”, but again completely uninterpreted and not tied to Lebesgue outer measure.
- theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_multivar_int_2583 ... : Under the assumptions h_int : Riemann_integrable_on f R, hf_nonneg : ∀ x ∈ R, 0 ≤ f x, h_integral_zero : integral_on f R = 0, conclude ∃ E, outer_measure_zero E ∧ ∀ x ∈ R \ E, f x = 0. So the claim is: if f is (according to the arbitrary predicate) integrable on R, nonnegative on R, and its (arbitrary) integral over R is zero, then there exists a set E of (arbitrary) outer-measure-zero such that f vanishes on R \ E.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original: Let R be a closed rectangle in ℝ^n. Let f : R → ℝ be Riemann integrable and nonnegative on R. If ∫_R f = 0, then there exists E ⊆ R of Lebesgue outer measure zero such that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R \ E.

Discrepancies:
- The code does not assert that R is a closed rectangle; R is an arbitrary set. This is a key hypothesis in the natural statement.
- The code takes f : ℝ^n → ℝ, not f : R → ℝ. While one can often restrict a global function to R, the statement as written is not faithful to the domain specification.
- The notions of “Riemann integrable on R” and “integral over R” are not Mathlib objects; they are arbitrary variables with no connection to any standard definition. This is a major red flag and violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions faithfully represent the intended concepts.
- The predicate outer_measure_zero is an arbitrary predicate, not tied to Lebesgue outer measure or any outer measure in Mathlib.
- The conclusion does not require E ⊆ R; it merely quantifies over x ∈ R \ E. While one could replace E by E ∩ R to get a subset, the statement as written is weaker and not literally faithful to “E ⊆ R”.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
Because the code replaces all core concepts (Riemann integrability, integral on a set, outer measure zero) by uninterpreted placeholders, and omits the crucial hypothesis that R is a closed rectangle, the translation is not faithful. Even if those placeholders were replaced by actual Mathlib notions, the missing rectangle hypothesis and the domain mismatch for f, and the lack of E ⊆ R would still make it not fully faithful.

Grade rationale: The code uses vacuous placeholders for all essential notions, and even if fixed, it misses key hypotheses and exactness (closed rectangle, domain of f, E ⊆ R). This fits the rubric closer to 3.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.

  Hypotheses:
  - hf : MeasureTheory.Integrable (fun t => |f t|): The function t ↦ |f t| is Lebesgue integrable on ℝ (i.e., ∫ |f| < ∞ and measurability of |f|).
  - hg_cont : Continuous g: g is continuous on ℝ.
  - hg_supp : ∀ x, x < a ∨ x > b → g x = 0: g(x) = 0 for all x outside the closed interval [a, b].
  Conclusion:
  - For every x ∈ ℝ, the function t ↦ f t * g (x - t) is Lebesgue integrable (i.e., its Lebesgue integral exists as a finite number). This is the well-definedness of the convolution integral in the Lebesgue sense.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL statement assumptions:
  - f is “Riemann integrable” and ∫_{−∞}^{∞} |f(x)| dx < ∞ (improper Riemann integral, absolute convergence).
  - g is continuous and zero outside [a, b].
- NL conclusion:
  - The convolution (g * f)(x) := ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt is well-defined for all x ∈ ℝ. Given the context, this means the improper Riemann integral exists (absolutely) for each x.

Step 3: Faithfulness check.
- The Lean code works entirely in the Lebesgue setting (MeasureTheory.Integrable), not the Riemann setting. It does not mention Riemann integrability at all.
- The hypothesis hf is Integrable (|f|) in the Lebesgue sense, which is different from “f is Riemann integrable and the improper integral of |f| is finite.” While absolute convergence of the improper Riemann integral implies Lebesgue integrability, the code’s hypothesis omits the Riemann aspect and changes the notion of integrability.
- The conclusion in Lean asserts Lebesgue integrability of t ↦ f t * g (x − t), not the existence of the improper Riemann integral. These are different notions, and the code does not bridge them.
- The support and continuity assumptions on g match the NL statement (g continuous and zero outside [a, b]).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; the only issue is the change of integrability framework and the omission of the Riemann condition.

Final verdict: The code states a closely related but different claim (Lebesgue integrability vs improper Riemann integrability). Under the strict guidelines, this is not a faithful translation.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Filter: set up Mathlib and filters.
- theorem dirichlet_bv_of_bounded_partial_sums {x : ℕ → ℝ} {a : ℕ → ℝ} ... : Summable (fun n => a n * x n)
  This states a theorem for real sequences x and a, concluding that the series ∑ a_n x_n converges.
- Hypothesis h_bdd: ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ N, |(Finset.sum (Finset.range (N+1)) (fun i => x i))| ≤ C.
  This means the partial sums of x_n from i = 0 to N are uniformly bounded in absolute value by some C. That is, the sequence of partial sums of x_n is bounded.
- Hypothesis h_lim: Filter.Tendsto (fun n => a n) Filter.atTop (nhds (0 : ℝ)).
  This says a_n → 0 as n → ∞.
- Hypothesis h_var: Summable (fun n => |a (n+1) - a n|).
  This says the series ∑ |a_{n+1} − a_n| converges (total variation is finite).
- Conclusion: Summable (fun n => a n * x n).
  The series ∑ a_n x_n converges (not necessarily absolutely).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: Given a series ∑ x_n with bounded partial sums and a sequence λ_n with λ_n → 0 and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| convergent, show that ∑ λ_n x_n converges.
- Matching of symbols: x ↔ x_n, a ↔ λ_n.
- Bounded partial sums: Lean uses sums from n = 0 to N; the NL uses from n = 1. This is an index-shift difference that does not change the substance (bounding shifts by a finite constant, equivalently bounded). Same for the variation series, adding/removing a finite initial term does not affect convergence.
- Limit condition: a_n → 0 matches λ_n → 0.
- Variation/summability: Lean assumes ∑ |a_{n+1} − a_n| converges; same as the NL.
- Conclusion: Lean concludes Summable of a_n x_n (i.e., convergence of ∑ a_n x_n), matching the NL conclusion.
- Type: Lean fixes ℝ; the NL did not specify field, but ℝ is a standard setting and a faithful specialization.

Auxiliary definitions: None. No vacuous placeholders. All hypotheses directly express the intended conditions using standard Mathlib notions (Summable, Tendsto, finite partial sums expressed via Finset.sum and absolute value).

Final check:
- The only differences are index starting at 0 vs 1 and working over ℝ, both acceptable and not changing the mathematical meaning of the claim. The statement is a faithful formalization of the Dirichlet/Abel-type test with bounded variation.

Therefore, the Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_smaller_value_of_polynomial_in_ball (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε)` introduces a positive real ε.
- `(p : Polynomial ℂ)` declares p to be a complex polynomial.
- `(hp : Polynomial.degree p ≠ 0)` assumes the (withBot) degree of p is not 0; this rules out nonzero constant polynomials but, by itself, would allow the zero polynomial since its degree is ⊥ and ⊥ ≠ 0.
- `(z0 : ℂ)` declares a complex point z0.
- `(hp0 : Polynomial.eval z0 p ≠ 0)` assumes p(z0) ≠ 0; this also ensures p is not the zero polynomial, since the zero polynomial evaluates to 0 everywhere.
- Conclusion: `∃ w : ℂ, w ∈ Metric.ball z0 ε ∧ (Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval w p) < Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval z0 p))` states there exists w with |w − z0| < ε such that |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

Assessment: This is the minimum-modulus-type conclusion for nonconstant complex polynomials with p(z0) ≠ 0.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- NL hypothesis: ε > 0. Matches hε.
- NL hypothesis: p is a nonconstant complex polynomial, or more generally a nonconstant power series converging in the open ball centered at z0 of radius ε. The Lean theorem only treats the polynomial case, not power series. So it captures a special case, not the full generality.
- Nonconstant condition: The NL requires “nonconstant.” The Lean code encodes this as degree p ≠ 0 together with p(z0) ≠ 0. Since the zero polynomial has degree ⊥ (which is ≠ 0) but is excluded by p(z0) ≠ 0, the combination indeed enforces nonconstant. This is acceptable, though a more direct Mathlib expression might be `p.natDegree ≠ 0` (which automatically excludes zero and nonzero constants) or `¬ p.IsConst`. Nonetheless, the current combination is logically adequate for nonconstant.
- NL hypothesis: p(z0) ≠ 0. Matches hp0.
- Conclusion: There exists w in the same ball such that |p(w)| < |p(z0)|. Matches the Lean conclusion.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- The Lean theorem exactly captures the polynomial case with the right conclusion.
- However, the NL statement explicitly includes a more general case (nonconstant power series convergent in the ball). The Lean code does not cover this generality. Therefore, the code is a strict special case of the NL statement, not a faithful translation of the full statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions appear; the assumptions and goal are meaningful. The only substantive discrepancy is the missing power-series generality.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the full natural language statement due to reduced generality, although it correctly translates the polynomial subcase and encodes nonconstancy acceptably via degree ≠ 0 together with p(z0) ≠ 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement: Let f : [a,b] → ℝ be bounded. Suppose there exists a sequence of partitions {P_k} with lim (U(P_k,f) − L(P_k,f)) = 0. Show f is Riemann integrable and that ∫_a^b f = lim U(P_k,f) = lim L(P_k,f).
- Issues:
  - The code uses entirely abstract placeholders (IsPartition, upper_sum, lower_sum, BoundedOnInterval, RiemannIntegrableOn, RiemannIntegral) with no connection to Mathlib's actual definitions. This means the theorem is about arbitrary predicates and functions, not specifically about Riemann sums or integrals.
  - The conclusion does not state that the common limit I equals the Riemann integral value RiemannIntegral f a b. In fact, RiemannIntegral is introduced but never used in the statement, so the key equality ∫_a^b f = lim U = lim L is missing.
  - The hypothesis is written with absolute values (|U−L| → 0) instead of U−L → 0; for real numbers these are equivalent, so this part is acceptable.
  - The function f is ℝ → ℝ instead of [a,b] → ℝ; this is commonly acceptable if boundedness is on [a,b], but since the other notions are abstract, this does not help the faithfulness.

3) Final comparison: same or different?
- Different. The code abstracts away all core notions (partition, upper/lower sums, integrability, integral) rather than using or defining them faithfully. Most importantly, it does not conclude the equality between the limit I and the Riemann integral value, which is required by the original statement. Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Grade justification: The code captures the rough shape (existence of a sequence of partitions whose upper/lower sums converge together implies integrability and both sequences converge to a common limit), but it does so in a fully abstract setting and omits the crucial equality to the integral. Since it neither uses Mathlib’s notions nor pins down the intended meaning, and misses a core part of the conclusion, it is not faithful. A low grade (4) reflects these substantial issues.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib / open Matrix: Use Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- Variables: R is a commutative ring; n is a finite type with decidable equality. This models n-by-n matrices over a commutative ring (the standard generality for determinants).
- def swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix n n R := fun i l => if l = j then A i k else if l = k then A i j else A i l. This defines the matrix obtained by swapping columns j and k of A: for each row i and column l, if l is j, take the entry from column k; if l is k, take the entry from column j; otherwise keep the entry.
- def swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix n n R := fun i l => if i = j then A k l else if i = k then A j l else A i l. This defines the matrix obtained by swapping rows j and k of A: for each row i and column l, if i is j, take the entry from row k; if i is k, take the entry from row j; otherwise keep the entry.
- theorem det_swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) {j k : n} (h : j ≠ k) : Matrix.det (swap_cols A j k) = - Matrix.det A := by sorry. This states that if j ≠ k, the determinant of the column-swapped matrix equals the negative of the determinant of A.
- theorem det_swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) {j k : n} (h : j ≠ k) : Matrix.det (swap_rows A j k) = - Matrix.det A := by sorry. This states that if j ≠ k, the determinant of the row-swapped matrix equals the negative of the determinant of A.
- theorem det_zero_of_row_eq (A : Matrix n n R) {j k : n} (h : j ≠ k) (heq : ∀ l, A j l = A k l) : Matrix.det A = 0 := by sorry. This states that if two distinct rows j and k are equal (entrywise), then the determinant is zero.
- theorem det_zero_of_col_eq (A : Matrix n n R) {j k : n} (h : j ≠ k) (heq : ∀ i, A i j = A i k) : Matrix.det A = 0 := by sorry. This states that if two distinct columns j and k are equal (entrywise), then the determinant is zero.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The statement requests: swapping column j and k yields det(A') = -det(A); swapping row j and k yields det(A') = -det(A); and if A has two equal rows or columns, then det(A) = 0. The code precisely formulates these three claims using standard Mathlib's Matrix.det and explicit swap definitions.
- The hypotheses j ≠ k appear in the swap lemmas and in the equal row/column lemmas, which is appropriate: “switching column j and k” presupposes j and k are distinct, and “two equal rows/columns” implicitly means distinct rows/columns are equal.
- The ambient generality (commutative ring R, arbitrary finite index type n) appropriately models “n-by-n matrix” without loss. This is standard and faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- Auxiliary definitions swap_cols and swap_rows are legitimate, correctly implement swaps, and are not vacuous placeholders.
- Theorems match the mathematical content exactly. No extra or missing conditions are present.
- No reliance on Laplace formula is encoded in the statements, but the instruction not to use Laplace pertains to proof method, not to the statement. Using “sorry” is acceptable for translation auditing per the task description.
- Use of Mathlib’s determinant is correct. Not using preexisting swap operations is fine; the custom definitions are faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It works in ℝ^n modeled as (Fin n → ℝ).
- U : Set (Fin n → ℝ) is a convex set (hU_convex : Convex ℝ U).
- f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is a real-valued function on ℝ^n.
- p : (Fin n → ℝ) → FormalMultilinearSeries ℝ (Fin n → ℝ) ℝ is a field of formal Taylor coefficients (the k-th coefficient is a continuous k-linear map).
- hFT : HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 f p U asserts that f has a formal Taylor series up to order 2 on U with coefficients given by p.
- hcont : ContinuousOn (fun x => p x 2) U says the second Taylor coefficient (the bilinear map) depends continuously on x on U (i.e., continuity of the second derivative, up to the normalization convention built into p).
- Conclusion: For any compact K ⊆ U and any ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for all x∈K and all h with ‖h‖ ≤ δ and x+h∈U, we have
  | f (x+h) - f x - (p x 1) (fun _ => h) - (1/2) * (p x 2) (fun _ => h) | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
Here (p x 1) is the first-order linear map (Frechet derivative at x), applied to h; (p x 2) is the bilinear second-order coefficient applied to (h,h) via (fun _ => h). The bound is uniform over x ∈ K, which encodes the uniform o(‖h‖^2) remainder on compact subsets.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ, differentiable, and its Hessian H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Conclude the second-order Taylor expansion
  f(x+h) = f(x) + ∇f(x) · h + (1/2) h^T H_f(x) h + o(‖h‖^2)
  as h → 0 uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The code encodes the uniform little-o remainder on compacts, uses Frechet derivatives (so ∇f and H_f are represented by p x 1 and p x 2, respectively), requires convex U, and continuity of the second derivative (hcont).
- The condition x+h ∈ U in the conclusion enforces staying in the domain where the regularity assumptions hold. This is a standard and acceptable formalization detail; it weakens the claim slightly but is consistent with the hypothesis “H_f is continuous on U”.

Potential mismatch: The factorial normalization.
- In mathlib, FormalMultilinearSeries and HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn are set up so that the k-th coefficient p x k is the k-th Frechet derivative divided by k! (this is the standard Taylor series convention). Consequently, the Taylor polynomial up to order 2 is
  f(x) + (p x 1)(h) + (p x 2)(h,h) + o(‖h‖^2),
with no extra 1/2 outside p x 2, because that 1/2 is already absorbed in p x 2.
- The code writes the second-order term as (1/2) * (p x 2) (fun _ => h), i.e., it applies an extra 1/2 factor. If p is the standard Taylor series from HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn then (p x 2) already corresponds to (1/2)·H_f(x) as a bilinear map; multiplying by 1/2 again yields (1/4)·H_f(x), which is incorrect.
- Alternatively, if one intended p x 2 to be the unscaled Hessian H_f(x), then HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 f p U would be false for such p (since the HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn convention uses the 1/k! scaling). Hence, within mathlib’s conventions, the second-order term should be (p x 2)(fun _ => h), not (1/2) * (p x 2)(fun _ => h).

Other points:
- The use of the norm on (Fin n → ℝ) (sup norm) versus the Euclidean norm in the NL statement is immaterial in finite dimensions for a little-o statement; norms are equivalent and the uniformity on compacts remains valid.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem is a proper statement (though the proof is sorry, which is allowed for translation auditing).

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- The only substantive discrepancy is the extra factor 1/2 in front of (p x 2)(...) under the standard mathlib convention for HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn. This yields an incorrect coefficient for the quadratic term relative to the intended Hessian term. Everything else (uniformity on compacts, convex U, continuity of the Hessian/second derivative, the presence of the linear term) aligns with the NL statement.
- Therefore, the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful due to the coefficient mismatch in the quadratic term.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the 1/2 factor on the quadratic term under mathlib’s conventions.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, which contains matrices and determinants.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: Work over a commutative ring R. This is the standard setting where det is defined in Mathlib.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type n is finite with decidable equality, so matrices `Matrix n n R` are square and determinants are defined.
- `theorem det_mul_jirilebl (A B : Matrix n n R) : (A * B).det = A.det * B.det := by sorry`: States the multiplicativity of the determinant for any square matrices A and B over R.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: For square matrices A and B, det(AB) = det(A) det(B). The Lean theorem states exactly this for square matrices indexed by a finite type n over a commutative ring R, which is the usual and necessary context in Mathlib for determinants. The hint about the proof method is not part of the theorem statement and the code only states the theorem (with an omitted proof), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions.

3) Final check:
- Domain/objects: square matrices over a commutative ring (implicitly required). The NL statement does not specify the coefficient ring, but the standard setting is a commutative ring or field; restricting to `CommRing` is faithful and necessary for `det` in Mathlib.
- Statement: det(AB) = det(A) det(B). Matches exactly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions. Only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof, which is allowed.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We work over a type X equipped only with a topological space structure (not necessarily a metric space).
- `open BoundedContinuousFunction Filter`: Open relevant namespaces.
- The theorem `tendsto_dist_iff_uniform` states: For a sequence `f_seq : ℕ → BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ` and a function `f : BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ`, the real sequence `n ↦ dist (f_seq n) f` tends to 0 if and only if for every ε > 0 there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x : X, we have `|(f_seq n : X → ℝ) x - (f : X → ℝ) x| ≤ ε`.
- In words: Convergence in the sup metric (since `dist` on `BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ` is the sup metric) is equivalent to uniform convergence of the underlying functions to f.

2) Does this faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement has two parts:
  (A) Show that `(C_b(X, ℝ), d)` is a metric space, where `d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x) - g(x)|`.
  (B) Show that convergence in `d` is equivalent to uniform convergence.
- The Lean theorem addresses only part (B) (the equivalence between convergence in the sup metric and uniform convergence). It does not assert or define that `(C_b(X, ℝ), d)` is a metric space, nor does it state the existence of the metric structure. It relies implicitly on Mathlib's existing metric/normed structure on `BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ` (via the sup norm/metric), but it does not present or prove part (A).
- Additionally, the Lean code assumes only `[TopologicalSpace X]` rather than the given hypothesis that `(X,d)` is a metric space. While the result about uniform convergence does not need X to be metric (topology suffices for continuity and the codomain ℝ being normed provides the sup metric), this is still a mismatch in the problem setup. However, the more serious issue is the complete omission of part (A).
- The right-hand side uses `≤ ε` rather than `< ε`. For limits, this is equivalent, so it's acceptable for (B).

3) Final comparison:
- The code is only a partial translation: it captures the second claim (equivalence of convergence in sup metric and uniform convergence) but omits the first claim (that `C_b(X, ℝ)` with this sup metric is a metric space). Therefore, the translation is not faithful to the full natural language statement. There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the main issue is incompleteness.

Grade rationale: The code is relevant and correctly targets one part of the statement using appropriate Mathlib objects, but it omits a key part (metric space structure) and slightly misaligns the hypothesis on X. Hence a low-but-not-terrible score.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- Comment block: States intent to formalize the given statement but announces the introduction of placeholder definitions to avoid depending on specific library names.
- def RiemannIntegrableOn (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True: Defines a predicate 'RiemannIntegrableOn f [a,b]' as always true. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the real definition of Riemann integrability.
- def RiemannIntegral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0: Defines the 'Riemann integral' of f over [a,b] to be identically 0. Another vacuous placeholder, not the real integral.

  Conclusion: RiemannIntegrableOn f a b ∧ Tendsto (fun n => RiemannIntegral f (a_n n) (b_n n)) atTop (nhds (RiemannIntegral f a b)).
  And the proof is omitted (by sorry).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: If f is bounded on [a,b], a_n ↘ a and b_n ↗ b with a < a_n < b_n < b, and f is Riemann integrable on [a_n, b_n] for all n, then f is Riemann integrable on [a,b] and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_{a_n}^{b_n} f.
- The structure of the theorem statement mirrors the original: correct hypotheses on sequences and boundedness; a conclusion that f is integrable on [a,b] and the integrals converge to the integral over [a,b] (expressed via Tendsto equals limit). So, at the level of logical form, the theorem statement matches the natural language statement.
- However, the code uses placeholder definitions:
  • RiemannIntegrableOn := True makes every function integrable on every interval, which is not faithful.
  • RiemannIntegral := 0 makes every integral zero, making the convergence claim trivial. This destroys the mathematical content.
- The presence of 'by sorry' further indicates no actual derivation, but even without a proof, the core issue is the vacuity of the auxiliary definitions.
- The comment explicitly says placeholders are used; per the guidelines, this is a red flag and not acceptable.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Main mismatch: The Lean code does not use real Mathlib notions of Riemann integrability or the Riemann integral; instead it defines vacuous placeholders. Hence, the theorem as written is trivially true and does not formalize the actual mathematical claim.
- Additionally, the actual limit statement in Lean is given as Tendsto of the sequence of integrals to the integral over [a,b], which is logically equivalent to the equality of the limit with the integral; this part is fine in principle.
- But overall, the translation fails because the key concepts are not faithfully defined. The auxiliary definitions are vacuous, violating the guideline that they must faithfully describe what they are trying to say.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib definitions (e.g., using Riemann or interval integrals from Mathlib) and without vacuity, the theorem statement would be faithful. As-is, it fails.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The first part of the statement (“Suppose f : I → ℝ is differentiable at c ∈ I... there exist real numbers a and b...”) matches the Lean conclusion, with s playing the role of I, and DifferentiableWithinAt corresponding to differentiability at c of a function defined on I. The inequality and quantifiers are correctly rendered.
- Minor mismatch: the natural statement explicitly assumes c ∈ I, while the Lean theorem does not include c ∈ s. Although DifferentiableWithinAt is defined even if c ∉ s, the original assumption c ∈ I is stricter and typical in such statements. This is a slight discrepancy.
- Major omission: The natural language statement also asks for the equivalent formulation with a function g: I → ℝ such that lim_{x→c} g(x) = 0 and |a + b(x − c) − f(x)| = |x − c| g(x) for x near c. The Lean code does not include this equivalence or any statement about such a g or its limit. Thus, only the first half of the natural statement is captured.
- Domain modeling: The natural statement has f : I → ℝ; the Lean uses f : ℝ → ℝ with differentiability within s. This is a standard and acceptable way to model differentiability of a function defined on a subset, so this aspect is fine.
- No auxiliary bogus definitions are present; the theorem statement itself is meaningful and precise for the first part.

Final check:
- The Lean code captures the first assertion but completely omits the “Equivalently, there exists g ...” part. It also omits the explicit c ∈ I hypothesis.
- Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful to the entire natural language statement.

- The original statement assumes additionally that {x_n} converges, and then asks to show the two inequalities. The Lean theorems assert the same inequalities but do not assume convergence of x at all; they only assume pointwise inequality x_n ≤ y_n. Thus, the Lean statements are strictly more general than the natural language statement and do not include the convergence hypothesis.
- All terminology used (liminf/limsup via filters atTop for sequences ℕ → ℝ) is standard in Mathlib and correctly captures liminf/limsup as n → ∞.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different: The Lean code omits the convergence hypothesis on x present in the natural language statement. While the conclusions are the same and the Lean result implies the stated result, this is not a faithful translation since it weakens the hypotheses and proves a stronger statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} {Rect : Type*} (rect_set : Rect → Set X) (V : Rect → ENNReal)`
  Interprets: We work on an arbitrary type X (playing the role of the ambient space) and a type Rect (playing the role of rectangles). Each rectangle R in Rect is associated with a subset of X via rect_set, and is assigned a nonnegative extended real number V(R) (intended as its “volume”).

- `noncomputable def m_star (S : Set X) : ENNReal := sInf ({ t : ENNReal | ∃ f : ℕ → Rect, t = ∑' j, V (f j) ∧ S ⊆ ⋃ j, rect_set (f j) } : Set ENNReal)`
  Defines m_star(S) as the infimum of all sums ∑' V(f j) taken over sequences f : ℕ → Rect such that the union of their associated sets covers S. This matches the usual “inf over countable sequences (indexed by ℕ)” definition of an outer premeasure-like construction.

- `noncomputable def mu_star (S : Set X) : ENNReal := sInf ({ t : ENNReal | ∃ (I : Type*) (hc : Countable I) (f : I → Rect), t = ∑' i, V (f i) ∧ S ⊆ ⋃ i, rect_set (f i) } : Set ENNReal)`
  Defines mu_star(S) as the infimum of all sums ∑' V(f i) over covers indexed by any countable type I (which includes finite and countably infinite index sets), with the union of associated sets covering S. This exactly encodes “finite or countably infinite index sets.”

- `theorem mu_eq_m (S : Set X) : mu_star rect_set V S = m_star rect_set V S := by sorry`
  States the desired equality of the two constructions for all S, without proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let m* on ℝ^n be defined by inf over countable coverings by open rectangles; define μ* by inf over finite or countable coverings by open rectangles. Show μ*(S) = m*(S) for all S ⊆ ℝ^n.
- The Lean code abstracts this to:
  • X is any space (generalization of ℝ^n).
  • Rect is any index type for the covering pieces, with rect_set specifying the actual sets in X (generalization of “open rectangles”).
  • V is any ENNReal weight function (generalization of volume of open rectangles).
  • m_star uses ℕ-indexed covers; mu_star uses any countable index set I (including finite).
  • The equality mu_star = m_star is asserted for all S.

These generalizations do not change the mathematical essence of the claim being proved: the equality relies only on the equivalence between using ℕ-indexed covers vs covers indexed by arbitrary finite or countable sets, via reindexing/enumeration. The specific nature of X as ℝ^n, the sets being open rectangles, and V being the volume, are immaterial to this equivalence. In particular, the condition “open rectangles” is not used in the argument that countable vs ℕ-indexed covers yield the same infimum.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Differences:
  • The code works for any space X, any family of covering sets (via rect_set), and any weight function V; the statement in the problem mentions ℝ^n, open rectangles, and volume. This is a generalization.
  • The code uses ENNReal for sums (standard in measure theory) and ∑' (tsum), which is appropriate.
  • Indexing: ℕ (starting at 0) vs {1,2,3,...} is inconsequential.
- None of these differences affect the core meaning of the statement: showing that allowing finite or countable index sets yields the same infimum as restricting to ℕ-indexed sequences. Thus, the code faithfully expresses the same mathematical content.

Auxiliary definitions are not vacuous; they are precise, standard Mathlib constructions, and no placeholder predicates are used. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but per the auditing instructions we only check the statement and definitions for faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement, up to harmless generalization that preserves the meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: Introduces a function f: ℝ → ℝ, but it is never used afterward.
- `variable (integrable_on_interval : ℝ → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate on real numbers. Intuitively this is meant to encode “f is Riemann integrable on [0, M]” for each M, but it is not defined in terms of f nor mathlib’s actual integrability notions; it is just a placeholder.
- `variable (interval_integral : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)`: Introduces an arbitrary function taking two reals to a real. Intuitively intended as the map (a, b) ↦ ∫_a^b f, but again, it is a completely free symbol with no link to f and no mathlib structure.
- `variable (has_finite_L1 : Prop)`: An arbitrary proposition, presumably intended to mean ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞, but again a bare placeholder.
- Lemma statement:
  `lemma improper_integral_exists_iff_tails (h_int : ∀ M, integrable_on_interval M) (h_L1 : has_finite_L1) : (∃ I, Tendsto (fun R => interval_integral 0 R) atTop (nhds I)) ↔ (∀ ε > 0, ∃ M, ∀ R ≥ M, abs (interval_integral M R) < ε) := by sorry`
  In words: Assuming (i) for every M, integrable_on_interval M holds, and (ii) has_finite_L1 holds, we have: “there exists I such that the function R ↦ interval_integral 0 R tends to I along atTop” if and only if “for every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, |interval_integral M R| < ε.” The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does this faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is: Let f: [0, ∞) → ℝ be Riemann integrable on each [0, M], and suppose ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞. Then ∫_0^∞ f exists if and only if for every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, |∫_M^R f| < ε.
- Similarities:
  - The left side of the equivalence in Lean, “∃ I, Tendsto (fun R => interval_integral 0 R) atTop (nhds I)”, matches the existence of the improper integral ∫_0^∞ f via the limit of ∫_0^R f as R → ∞.
  - The right side in Lean, “∀ ε > 0, ∃ M, ∀ R ≥ M, |interval_integral M R| < ε”, matches the tail criterion |∫_M^R f| < ε for all R ≥ M.
  - Hypotheses are present in Lean as h_int, h_L1 ostensibly corresponding to “integrable on [0,M]” and “∫|f| < ∞.”
- Critical problems:
  - integrable_on_interval, interval_integral, and has_finite_L1 are completely unconstrained placeholders, not defined in terms of f nor using mathlib’s actual notions (like Riemann integrability or `intervalIntegral`). This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous.
  - f is introduced but never used. There is no link between f and interval_integral, nor between f and integrable_on_interval, nor between f and has_finite_L1.
  - The code does not use or reference mathlib’s established concepts for Riemann or Lebesgue integrals (e.g., `intervalIntegral`, `Interval`, `IntegrableOn`, etc.). It instead introduces ad hoc symbols.
  - The lemma includes a `sorry`, which is acceptable for skipping proofs in this auditing context only if the statements and definitions are faithful. Here, the problem lies in the vacuous placeholders.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The intended mathematical statement and the Lean lemma’s surface logical shape (limit exists ↔ tails small), under the stated hypotheses, align conceptually. However, the code fails to tie any of these notions to the function f or to bona fide integrability concepts. All key notions are placeholders with no semantics.
- Therefore, the Lean code does not constitute a faithful translation: it could be interpreted as an abstract equivalence about an arbitrary function R ↦ interval_integral 0 R and arbitrary tails interval_integral M R, with arbitrary extra assumptions h_int, h_L1 that are not used to constrain these functions. This is not the same as the precise, mathematical statement about improper Riemann integrals of a specific f with absolute integrability.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean statement:
- Context: `A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)` means A is a continuous linear map from (Fin n → ℝ) to (Fin m → ℝ). In mathlib, (Fin n → ℝ) is a model for ℝ^n with its default norm (the sup norm on coordinates). The norm on ContinuousLinearMap is the operator norm `A.opNorm`.
- The theorem asserts the existence of a vector `x : Fin n → ℝ` such that:
  • `‖x‖ = 1` (x is on the unit sphere),
  • `‖A x‖ = A.opNorm` (A attains its operator norm at x),
  • `(∀ y, ‖y‖ = 1 → ‖A y‖ ≤ ‖A x‖)` (x maximizes ‖A y‖ among y on the unit sphere),
  • `(∀ y, ‖y‖ ≤ 1 → ‖A y‖ ≤ A.opNorm)` (on the closed unit ball, ‖A y‖ is bounded above by the operator norm),
  • `(∀ ε > 0, ∃ y, ‖y‖ < 1 ∧ ‖A y‖ > A.opNorm - ε)` (values on the open unit ball approximate the operator norm from below arbitrarily closely).
- Interpreting these together: the first three bullets encode that the supremum on the unit sphere is actually a maximum and equals `A.opNorm`. The fourth bullet shows the supremum on the closed unit ball is ≤ `A.opNorm`, which together with the existence of an x in the closed unit ball attaining `A.opNorm` shows that the supremum on the closed unit ball equals `A.opNorm`. The last bullet plus the upper bound (since `‖y‖ < 1` implies `‖y‖ ≤ 1`) shows the supremum on the open unit ball is also `A.opNorm`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: For any norm on ℝ^n (and implicitly with some norm on ℝ^m, because ‖Ax‖ is used), the operator norm on L(ℝ^n,ℝ^m) equals the maximum on the unit sphere, equals the sup on the closed unit ball, equals the sup on the open unit ball. It suggests using compactness of the unit sphere in finite dimensions to justify the maximum.
- The Lean statement captures the chain of equalities in an equivalent, property-based form: existence of a maximizer on the unit sphere, a universal upper bound on the closed unit ball, and the epsilon-approximation on the open unit ball. This is a faithful logical encoding of the equality: ‖A‖ = max_{‖x‖=1} ‖A x‖ = sup_{‖x‖≤1} ‖A x‖ = sup_{‖x‖<1} ‖A x‖ for the specific norms in play.

3) Differences and issues:
- Major generality mismatch: The NL statement says “Let ‖·‖ be any norm on ℝ^n.” The Lean code fixes the specific model (Fin n → ℝ) with its default norm (the sup norm on coordinates). It does not quantify over arbitrary norms on ℝ^n (nor over norms on ℝ^m). Thus, it proves a strictly more special statement than the NL one, which is supposed to hold for any choice of norms. Under the auditing guidelines, this is not fully faithful.
- Edge case n = 0: The Lean statement requires existence of x with ‖x‖ = 1, which is impossible if n = 0 (the unit sphere is empty). The natural language typically assumes a nontrivial space or leaves the case ill-posed for the “max over unit sphere.” The code does not handle this edge case; while this doesn’t by itself break the translation, it is another mismatch against the intended generality.
- Otherwise, within the chosen model, the logical content matches the chain of equalities the NL statement requests: maximum on the sphere, sup on the closed ball, sup on the open ball, all equal to the operator norm. The epsilon-condition is a standard equivalent formulation for equality of the sup on the open ball with the operator norm.

Conclusion: Although the internal logical content matches the desired equalities for the specific normed spaces chosen, the code fails to capture the intended generality “any norm on ℝ^n (and implicitly a norm on ℝ^m).” Under the strict auditing guidelines, this counts as not faithful.

This Lean code asserts only the trivial proposition `True` and provides no definitions or statements about functions, integrals, partitions, or Riemann sums.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: Given a Riemann integrable function f on [a,b] and any epsilon > 0, there exists a partition P = {x_0, ..., x_n} such that for every choice of tags c_k in [x_{k-1}, x_k], the absolute difference between the integral of f over [a,b] and the corresponding Riemann sum is less than epsilon. This involves precise notions: Riemann integrability, partitions, tags, Riemann sums, and quantitative closeness to the integral.

The Lean code does not mention any of these notions. It does not quantify over f, a, b, epsilon, partitions, or sums. It simply states `True` and uses `sorry`.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
They are completely different. The Lean theorem is a vacuous tautology with no relation to Riemann integration. Moreover, the presence of `sorry` indicates an omitted proof, violating the guideline that auxiliary content not be vacuous. There are no auxiliary definitions at all, and the final statement is unrelated.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: R is a commutative ring; matrices are square m-by-m over R with indices Fin m.

- Theorem ASA_transpose_diagonal:
  Statement: For any square matrix A, define S by S k l = (-1 : R)^(k.toNat + l.toNat). Then for all i, j with i ≠ j, the (i,j)-entry of A * S * Aᵀ is 0. In other words, A S Aᵀ is diagonal. This matches the natural language description of S having entries (-1)^{i+j}. Using Fin indices (0-based) does not change the parity of i+j, so this is faithful.

- Theorem transpose_inverse_via_cofactor:
  Hypothesis: IsUnit (det A). Conclusion: Aᵀ * ((↑(h.unit⁻¹) : R) • (A.adjugate)ᵀ) = 1 and ((↑(h.unit⁻¹) : R) • (A.adjugate)ᵀ) * Aᵀ = 1. This asserts that the matrix ((1/det A) times (A.adjugate)ᵀ) is a two-sided inverse of Aᵀ; hence it equals (Aᵀ)⁻¹ when an inverse is considered. In Mathlib, adjugate is (by definition) the transpose of the cofactor matrix, so (A.adjugate)ᵀ is precisely the cofactor matrix B. The scalar (↑(h.unit⁻¹) : R) is 1/det(A) under the assumption det(A) is a unit. Thus the statement is exactly that (Aᵀ)⁻¹ = (1/det A) · B, and it even proves both-sided inverse equalities.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- First part: The code states that A S Aᵀ has all off-diagonal entries zero, which is equivalent to being diagonal, with S given by S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j}. This matches the natural language statement precisely.
- Second part: The code assumes IsUnit (det A), which in this setting is equivalent to A being invertible. It concludes that the inverse of Aᵀ equals (1/det A) times the cofactor matrix, by expressing two-sided inverse equalities. This matches the natural language statement that (Aᵀ)^{-1} = (1/det A) B, where B is the cofactor matrix. Representing B as (A.adjugate)ᵀ is standard in Mathlib and faithful to the usual definition.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing parity (0-based Fin vs 1-based in prose): no difference for (-1)^{i+j}.
- Base ring: The code uses a commutative ring R, which is standard for Laplace/adjugate identities and does not weaken or alter the intended claim.
- Invertibility assumption: The code uses IsUnit (det A), equivalent to A invertible in this context; moreover, the conclusion is stated as two-sided inverse equalities, which is equivalent to the stated equality with (Aᵀ)^{-1}.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms (det, adjugate, transpose) are standard Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, the standard mathematical library for Lean.
- `variable {n : Nat}`: Introduces a natural number n.
- `open EuclideanSpace`: Opens notation and definitions for Euclidean spaces.
- `variable {x0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)}`: Declares a point x0 in ℝ^n, represented in Lean as EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n).
- `variable {f : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → ℝ}`: Declares a function f: ℝ^n → ℝ.
- The theorem:
  `/-- For a differentiable real-valued function on Euclidean space, the norm of the gradient at x0
      equals the operator norm of the derivative at x0. -/`
  `theorem gradient_norm_eq_opNorm_fderiv (hf : DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0) :
    ‖gradient f x0‖ = (fderiv ℝ f x0).opNorm := by sorry`
  This states: If f is differentiable at x0, then the norm of the gradient at x0 equals the operator norm of the derivative (Fréchet derivative) at x0.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: For f: ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable at x0, ‖∇f(x0)‖ = sup{ |Df(x0) h| : ‖h‖ = 1 }. It clarifies that this is the operator norm of the derivative.
- The Lean statement asserts exactly that the norm of the gradient equals the operator norm of the derivative. In Mathlib, `fderiv ℝ f x0` is the derivative as a continuous linear map, and `.opNorm` is the operator norm, which coincides with sup over unit vectors of the norm of the image, i.e., sup{ |Df(x0) h| : ‖h‖ ≤ 1 }, and hence equals the sup over ‖h‖ = 1 for linear maps. Thus, the Lean statement is logically equivalent to the natural language statement.
- The domain ℝ^n is faithfully represented as `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. The differentiability hypothesis matches `DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0`. The gradient and derivative are standard Mathlib notions. There are no fake auxiliary definitions.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- The only notational difference is that the natural language uses the explicit sup definition of the operator norm over ‖h‖ = 1, while the Lean statement uses `.opNorm`. These are mathematically equivalent in this context. No other discrepancies.
- No vacuous placeholders or misleading definitions are present; the theorem statement directly matches the intended mathematical claim.

- In Mathlib, `opNorm` is the operator norm; in finite dimensions every linear map is continuous, so restricting to `→L[ℝ]` is harmless.
- The code uses (Fin n → ℝ) as ℝ^n with its standard (sup) norm; the natural language did not specify which norm, but the claimed equalities hold for any norm on finite-dimensional ℝ^n, so this is not a substantive mismatch.
- The natural language mentions a max over the unit sphere; the code phrases it as a supremum. In finite dimension this supremum is attained, so the quantities coincide. Since the theorem’s purpose is to equate the “max over sphere” definition with the suprema over ≤1 and <1, stating equality with sSup is mathematically equivalent to the intended conclusion.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- Possible edge case n = 0: the unit sphere {‖x‖ = 1} is empty, so the first sSup is over an empty set. The natural language statement implicitly assumes n ≥ 1 to make the definition by “max over ‖x‖ = 1” meaningful. The Lean statement quantifies over all n ∈ ℕ, including 0. This is a mild mismatch. In practice, texts usually mean n ≥ 1 when writing ℝ^n in this context.
- The code uses sSup rather than an explicit `max`. This is not a problem for faithfulness, because the goal is to identify equality with the suprema; the “max” is a definitional preface in the NL statement, not an additional claim to be reproduced. If desired, one could strengthen the first equality to a `sSup = max` in finite dimensions, but it’s not necessary for the equivalences.
- A is a continuous linear map in Lean, whereas the NL says a linear operator on ℝ^n; in finite-dimensional spaces these notions coincide. No issue.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the intended equalities between the operator norm and the two suprema, and even includes the sphere version. The only notable discrepancy is the inclusion of the n = 0 case, which the natural language implicitly avoids. Overall this is very close to the intended statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It declares topological spaces X and Y, with Y assumed to be locally compact (LocallyCompactSpace Y) and Hausdorff (T2Space Y).
- It fixes a function f : X → Y and assumes:
  • hclosed : IsClosedMap f (f sends closed sets in X to closed sets in Y),
  • hcont : Continuous f,
  • hinj : Injective f.
- Under these assumptions, it defines (or promises) a homeomorphism Homeomorph X (↥(range f)), i.e., a homeomorphism from X onto the subtype of Y consisting of points in the range of f, which is precisely “a homeomorphism onto its image”. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but that is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space and f : X → Y a closed injection. Prove that f is a homeomorphism onto its image.”
- The code matches: Y is locally compact and Hausdorff; the conclusion is exactly a homeomorphism onto the image (Homeomorph X (range f)).
- However, the code adds an extra hypothesis: hcont : Continuous f. The NL statement says “closed injection.” In standard usage, “closed map” does not necessarily imply continuity (it often means a function that sends closed sets to closed sets, not necessarily continuous), though some authors reserve “closed map” for continuous maps. The Lean code explicitly requires continuity; the NL statement does not explicitly state continuity. Thus the Lean statement is strictly stronger unless one interprets “closed injection” as implicitly including continuity.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- The Lean code proves a stronger result by assuming continuity in addition to being closed and injective, while the NL statement does not explicitly include continuity. Therefore, under a strict reading, the Lean code is not a faithful translation due to the extra assumption. Everything else aligns: Y is LCH, f is injective and closed, and the conclusion is a homeomorphism onto the image.

Given the extra-harsh auditing standard, this mismatch means the translation fails to be fully faithful, although it is very close.

- `variable {n : ℕ}`: fix a natural number n, the dimension.
- `noncomputable def A (a : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) : ℝ →L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) := ContinuousLinearMap.mk (LinearMap.smulRight (LinearMap.id : ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ) a)`:
  • Here `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is the standard ℝ^n with its Euclidean structure.
  • `LinearMap.id : ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ` is the identity linear map on ℝ.
  • `LinearMap.smulRight ... a` produces the linear map from ℝ to ℝ^n given by x ↦ (id x) • a = x • a.
  • Wrapping with `ContinuousLinearMap.mk` declares it as a continuous linear map ℝ →L[ℝ] ℝ^n (which is appropriate since everything is finite-dimensional and hence continuous). The intended meaning is exactly A x = x a as in the NL statement.
- `theorem opNorm_eq_norm (a : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) : ‖A a‖ = ‖a‖ := by sorry`:
  • This states that the operator norm of the continuous linear map A corresponding to vector a equals the Euclidean norm of a. The norm on `ℝ →L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is the operator norm; the norm on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is the Euclidean norm. This matches the claim.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The NL statement: Given A in L(ℝ, ℝ^n) defined by Ax = x a, show ‖A‖ = ‖a‖ with standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^n.
- The Lean code models ℝ^n as `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (standard in Mathlib) and `L(ℝ, ℝ^n)` as `ℝ →L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (continuous/bounded linear maps, which coincide in finite dimension). The definition `A a` indeed encodes Ax = x • a. The theorem states exactly that the operator norm of `A a` equals the Euclidean norm of `a`.
- There are no vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definition `A` is the correct map. The theorem is stated without proof, which is allowed per the instructions.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain, definition of A, and the equality of norms match precisely.
- Use of EuclideanSpace corresponds to standard ℝ^n with Euclidean norm.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem `differentiable_at_error_bound` is stated in the general setting of a real normed vector space `E`:
  - `E` is a real normed vector space (`[NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]`).
  - `f : E → ℝ`, `x0 : E`.
  - `f' : E →L[ℝ] ℝ` is a continuous linear map (the Fréchet derivative at `x0`).
  - Hypothesis `hf : HasFDerivAt f f' x0` states that `f` is differentiable at `x0` with derivative `f'`.
  - Conclusion: For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all `h : E` with ‖h‖ < δ,
    |f(x0 + h) − f x0 − f' h| ≤ (‖f'‖ + ε) · ‖h‖.
  - Ends with `by sorry` (proof omitted), which is acceptable here since we are only auditing the statement.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- Original statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable at x0, show
  |f(x0 + h) − f(x0) − Df(x0) h| ≤ ‖Df(x0)‖ ‖h‖ + o(‖h‖) as h → 0. Equivalently, for every ε > 0, for small enough h, |…| ≤ (‖Df(x0)‖ + ε) ‖h‖.
- The Lean statement is precisely the ε–δ form of the bound “≤ operator norm times step plus a smaller-order term,” using the standard operator norm ‖f'‖ and the derivative `f'`. The condition “as h → 0” is captured by the existence of δ > 0 such that the inequality holds whenever ‖h‖ < δ.
- Domain: The Lean theorem is more general (any real normed vector space `E` instead of ℝ^n), which is a faithful strengthening and does not change the mathematical meaning in the original context.
- All notions are standard Mathlib ones: `HasFDerivAt`, `E →L[ℝ] ℝ`, operator norm `‖f'‖`, absolute value `|·|`, and norms `‖·‖`. No placeholder or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced.

Final check: The two statements have the same mathematical meaning. The Lean code captures exactly the intended “≤ ‖Df(x0)‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖)” bound in the usual ε–δ form. The only difference is a harmless generalization from ℝ^n to a general real normed space. There are no mismatches or red flags.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra hypotheses are added, none are missing.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def proper_map ... (f : X → Y) : Prop := ∀ (K : Set Y), IsCompact K → IsCompact (f ⁻¹' K)`
  Natural language: A map f is proper if for every compact set K in Y, the preimage f^{-1}(K) is compact in X. This is a standard definition of a proper map (the ""preimage of compact is compact"" notion). It does not bake in continuity, which is customary in many texts when one states ""a continuous map is proper"".

- `theorem continuous_compact_to_t2_is_proper ... [CompactSpace X] [T2Space Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) : proper_map f := ...`
  Natural language: If X is compact and Y is Hausdorff, then any continuous map f : X → Y is proper in the sense defined above. This matches the usual theorem: in a Hausdorff space, compact sets are closed, so the preimage of a compact set is closed in X; hence it is compact as a closed subset of a compact space.

Assessment of auxiliary definitions:
- The only auxiliary definition is `proper_map`, which is a legitimate, standard definition (not vacuous). It uses Mathlib notions (`IsCompact`, preimage, `Set`) correctly.

Matching to the original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that every continuous map f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is proper.""
- Lean: Assumes X compact, Y Hausdorff, f continuous, concludes f is proper (with proper_map defined as pulling back compact sets to compact sets). This is precisely the intended statement. No extra or missing hypotheses. The Hausdorff assumption, though not necessary for the implication ""image of compact is compact"", is exactly what is needed for this notion of properness and matches the given NL statement.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No discrepancies or vacuous placeholders. The use of Mathlib terms is appropriate. Proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed, since we only audit the translation of the statement.

  - Natural language: For a fixed n, assuming an arbitrary topological space structure on `Option (Fin n → ℝ)` and an arbitrary topological space structure on the subtype `{ x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // ‖x‖ = 1 }`, there exists a homeomorphism between these two topological spaces.

2) Does this match the intended statement?
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the one-point compactification of ℝ^n is homeomorphic to the unit sphere S^n.” This has several precise mathematical components:
  - The one-point compactification is a specific construction, in Mathlib given by `OnePoint α` with its canonical topology, not `Option α` with an arbitrary topology.
  - The target sphere S^n is the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1} with the standard Euclidean structure (i.e., EuclideanSpace with its canonical topology/norm), not an arbitrary subtype with an arbitrarily declared topology.
- Problems in the Lean statement:
  - They used `Option (Fin n → ℝ)` instead of `OnePoint (Fin n → ℝ)`. Option is just a type with an extra point, not the one-point compactification unless equipped with the specific one-point compactification topology. The code does not specify that topology; instead it assumes an arbitrary `[TopologicalSpace (Option (Fin n → ℝ))]`. This is a fundamental mismatch: the theorem now talks about some unspecified topology on the underlying type, not the one-point compactification.
  - For the sphere, they wrote `{ x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // ‖x‖ = 1 }` but again assumed an arbitrary topological space instance `[TopologicalSpace {...}]`. The intended object is the unit sphere as a subspace of ℝ^{n+1} with its standard topology. The statement now ranges over any topology on that set, which is not faithful.
  - Moreover, the ambient type `Fin (n+1) → ℝ` in Lean carries the sup-norm by default, so `‖x‖ = 1` refers to the sup norm unit “sphere,” not the Euclidean sphere S^n. The usual S^n is the unit sphere in EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1)) with the Euclidean norm. The code does not use EuclideanSpace and thus denotes a different subset. While these spheres are known to be homeomorphic in finite dimensions, the statement as written is not the standard S^n and so is not a faithful translation.
  - The theorem quantifies over arbitrary topological space structures for both domain and codomain. That turns the claim into: “there exists a homeomorphism between these two underlying types endowed with whatever topologies you hand me,” which is definitely not the intended claim. The intended statement uses the canonical topologies.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced, so no vacuity there; however, the key concepts (one-point compactification and S^n) are misrepresented by the types/instances chosen.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - One-point compactification vs. `Option` with arbitrary topology: not the same.
  - Euclidean sphere S^n vs. sup-norm unit set, and again with arbitrary topology: not the same.
  - Universal quantification over topological structures vs. using canonical instances: not the same.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language claim.

Grade rationale: The code is thematically related (adds a point and refers to a unit sphere) but misuses `Option` instead of `OnePoint`, imposes arbitrary topologies, and uses the wrong ambient structure for S^n. These are fundamental mismatches, so the translation fails. Hence a low grade.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.

- constant RiemannIntegrableOn : ((Fin n -> Real) -> Real) -> Set (Fin n -> Real) -> Prop: Introduces an uninterpreted predicate symbol for “Riemann integrable on a set.” This is a placeholder, not the Mathlib notion.
- constant RiemannIntegral : ((Fin n -> Real) -> Real) -> Set (Fin n -> Real) -> Real: Introduces an uninterpreted function symbol for the “Riemann integral over a set.” Placeholder as well.
- constant Volume : Set (Fin n -> Real) -> Real: Introduces an uninterpreted function symbol for “volume” of a set. Not Mathlib’s measure/volume.
- theorem union_integral_of_zero_intersection (hR : S ∪ T = R) (hV : Volume (S ∩ T) = 0) (h1 : RiemannIntegrableOn f S) (h2 : RiemannIntegrableOn f T) : RiemannIntegrableOn f R ∧ RiemannIntegral f R = RiemannIntegral f S + RiemannIntegral f T := by sorry: States that if R = S ∪ T, the “volume” of S ∩ T is 0, and f is “Riemann integrable” on S and T, then f is “Riemann integrable” on R and the “integral” over R is the sum of the “integrals” over S and T. The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The NL statement is about rectangles R', R'' in ℝ^n such that R = R' ∪ R'' is a rectangle, and R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle with one side length 0 (hence zero volume). f: R → ℝ is Riemann integrable on R' and R''. Conclude f is Riemann integrable on R and the integral over R equals the sum over R' and R''.
- Mismatches:
  - No notion of “rectangle” appears anywhere in the Lean code. R, S, T are arbitrary sets; there is no constraint that they are rectangles, or even measurable or Jordan measurable.
  - The special structural assumption “R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle with one side length 0” is not captured; the code uses only Volume (S ∩ T) = 0. Even if volume zero implies that specific degeneracy, the Lean statement is strictly more general (any sets with zero-volume intersection), hence not the same theorem.
  - The code’s f is defined on the whole space, not on R. This could be harmless if the integrals are over sets, but still differs from the NL phrasing.
  - The predicates and functions RiemannIntegrableOn, RiemannIntegral, Volume are uninterpreted constants, not Mathlib’s standard notions. This is a major red flag per the guidelines; they are vacuous placeholders.
  - The theorem ends with sorry, which indicates no proof and also suggests the code is a stub; per the task’s guidance, auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is missing the rectangle hypotheses and replaces the geometric condition on the intersection by a zero-volume condition for arbitrary sets. It also uses placeholder, uninterpreted definitions for integrability and integral and volume, not Mathlib’s. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the original statement, and even if the placeholders were replaced by proper definitions, the theorem stated would be a stronger, different claim, not specifically about rectangles.

Conclusion: Not faithful. Multiple critical issues: vacuous placeholders, missing rectangle structure, different hypothesis (zero volume only), and sorry. Grade reflects that even if the placeholders were fixed, the statement would still be different due to missing rectangle assumptions.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `universe u`, `open Topology`: Boilerplate imports and universe setup.
- `class LocallySimplyConnectedSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop`: Introduces a new typeclass predicate stating that X is locally simply connected. The accompanying docstring explicitly says this is an opaque placeholder for the usual topological condition; no definition or structure is provided. This is a custom predicate unrelated to any Mathlib definition and carries no content aside from its name.
- The theorem
  `theorem compact_locally_simply_connected_fundamental_group_fg {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X]
    [CompactSpace X] [LocallySimplyConnectedSpace X] (x : X) : Group.FG (FundamentalGroup X x) := by sorry`
  states: For any topological space X with a topology, if X is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`) and satisfies the (custom) predicate `[LocallySimplyConnectedSpace X]`, then for every basepoint `x : X`, the fundamental group `FundamentalGroup X x` is finitely generated (`Group.FG`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation checking.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that every compact, locally simply connected topological space has finitely generated fundamental group."" This is intended as: For any compact topological space X that is locally simply connected, the fundamental group (implicitly at a basepoint; or equivalently, at each basepoint) is finitely generated.
- The theorem's logical shape matches this: it quantifies over an arbitrary basepoint `x` and asserts finite generation of `π1(X,x)`. So, ignoring the auxiliary definitions, the conclusion aligns with the NL statement.

However, there is a critical issue:
- The auxiliary definition `LocallySimplyConnectedSpace` is a vacuous placeholder with no content (an empty Prop-class) and explicitly documented as such. It does not faithfully define the usual topological notion of being locally simply connected, nor does it tie into Mathlib's topology library. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must faithfully describe what they claim to represent and not be vacuous placeholders.
- Because the key hypothesis is encoded via an opaque, content-less predicate, the translation is not faithful, even though the outer theorem statement mimics the intended English statement.

Minor notes:
- The use of `FundamentalGroup X x` matches Mathlib's notion of the fundamental group at a basepoint. The theorem correctly quantifies over `x`, which corresponds to ""at each basepoint""; this is compatible with the natural language phrasing.
- The use of `Group.FG` suggests the standard Mathlib predicate for a finitely generated group, and since the code is stated to compile, this is presumably a valid Mathlib predicate.

Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? No, because the Lean code relies on an undefined, placeholder predicate for ""locally simply connected"" rather than a faithful Mathlib definition. Thus, while the outer form of the theorem matches, the crucial hypothesis is not properly formalized, making the translation unfaithful.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definition undermines faithfulness, but if that predicate were properly defined to match the usual notion, the final theorem statement would match the natural language statement. This fits the rubric for a 6.

- Hypothesis `hseq : ∀ (u : ℕ → X), ∃ x : X, ∃ s : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono s ∧ Tendsto (u ∘ s) atTop (𝓝 x)`: This states sequential compactness of X in the standard form: for every sequence u in X, there is a point x in X and a strictly increasing function s: ℕ → ℕ such that the subsequence u ∘ s converges to x.
- Conclusion `IsCompact (univ : Set X)`: The whole space X (viewed as the set univ) is compact.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement is: If X is a metric space and sequentially compact, then every open cover of X admits a finite subcover. In Lean, `IsCompact (univ : Set X)` is exactly the compactness of the whole space X, which is equivalent to the statement about every open cover admitting a finite subcover. The hypothesis `hseq` precisely encodes sequential compactness in a metric space. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib notions (MetricSpace, StrictMono, Tendsto, atTop, 𝓝, IsCompact).

3) Final check:
The two statements are mathematically equivalent: sequential compactness (as formulated by `hseq`) implies compactness of X (`IsCompact univ`), which in turn is equivalent to every open cover of X having a finite subcover. No discrepancies or weakening/strengthening are present. The code is a faithful translation.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Comment explains: the file states the claim that in an arbitrary metric space, a closed and bounded subset is compact (not true in general), and gives only the statement.
- Theorem statement:
  - `theorem closed_bounded_compact {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] {S : Set X}`: Let X be a metric space and S ⊆ X.
  - Hypotheses:
    - `(h_closed : IsClosed S)`: S is closed in X.
    - `(h_bounded : ∃ (x0 : X) (R : ℝ), 0 < R ∧ S ⊆ Metric.ball x0 R)`: S is bounded in the sense that there exists a center x0 and a positive radius R such that S is contained in the open ball centered at x0 with radius R.
  - Conclusion: `: IsCompact S`: S is compact (as a subset of X).
  - `by sorry`: No proof provided.

Step 2: Assess if this matches the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: ""Let X be a metric space. Prove that if S ⊂ X is closed and bounded, then S is compact."" The code precisely states: for any metric space X and set S, if S is closed and contained in some open ball (with positive radius), then S is compact. In metric spaces, ""bounded"" (in the standard sense) is equivalent to being contained in some ball around a point; the use of an open ball with R > 0 is equivalent to standard boundedness (since from boundedness S ⊆ closedBall(x0, R'), one can enlarge R slightly to get an open ball; conversely containment in an open ball implies boundedness). Therefore, the boundedness hypothesis is a faithful expression of ""bounded"" in a metric space. The rest (closedness and compactness) matches the statement exactly. The proof is omitted, which is allowed per the auditing instructions.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain and objects: metric space X, subset S — match.
- Hypotheses: closed and bounded — match; boundedness encoded as containment in an open ball with positive radius, which is equivalent in metric spaces.
- Conclusion: S is compact — match.
- No extraneous hypotheses (e.g., completeness, properness) are added.
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any types X and Y equipped with topological structures, if X is compact and Y is compact (in the sense of CompactSpace), then the product space X × Y is compact (CompactSpace (X × Y)). The proof is omitted (sorry), but we only assess the statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: Let X and Y be compact topological spaces. Prove that every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover.
- In Mathlib, CompactSpace α means the whole space α is compact, which is equivalent to “every open cover of α has a finite subcover.” Thus, stating CompactSpace (X × Y) is exactly the same as asserting that every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover.
- The Lean theorem takes as hypotheses CompactSpace X and CompactSpace Y (i.e., X and Y are compact), matching “Let X and Y be compact topological spaces.”

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The code’s conclusion CompactSpace (X × Y) is equivalent to the natural language statement about finite subcovers of open covers of X × Y, under the assumption that X and Y are compact. There are no extraneous or vacuous definitions, and the formulation uses standard Mathlib concepts.
- No discrepancies: the code states precisely the compactness of the product under compactness of the factors, which is the finite-product case of Tychonoff and exactly what the natural language asks.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code imports Mathlib.
- It defines a constant/definition `continuous_bijective_compact_to_T2_homeomorph` with parameters: topological spaces X and Y, a compact space structure on X, a T2 (Hausdorff) structure on Y, and a function f : X → Y with hypotheses hf : Continuous f and hb : Function.Bijective f.
- The return type is `Homeomorph X Y`, and the body is `by sorry` (proof/term omitted).

In natural language: Given any continuous bijection f from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y, this definition claims to produce a homeomorphism between X and Y. However, the statement does not assert that the produced homeomorphism has underlying function equal to f; it merely produces some `Homeomorph X Y`.

2) Compare to the original statement:
- Original: “A continuous bijection f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism.” This means that the given map f itself is a homeomorphism (equivalently, the inverse of f is continuous), not just that X and Y are homeomorphic via some possibly different map.
- Lean code: Asserts that from the hypotheses on f, one can construct a `Homeomorph X Y`. It does not relate the produced homeomorphism to f (e.g., it does not guarantee `e.toContinuousMap.toFun = f` or `e.toEquiv = ⟨f, _⟩`). Thus it proves only the weaker statement: existence of some homeomorphism between X and Y, given the existence of a continuous bijection f, rather than that f itself is the homeomorphism.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Hypotheses match: CompactSpace X, T2Space Y, f continuous and bijective.
- Conclusion mismatch: The original claims “f is a homeomorphism” (i.e., the homeomorphism’s forward map equals f), whereas the code’s type only claims existence of a homeomorphism between X and Y without tying it to f.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions here; the only placeholder is the `sorry` for the construction, which is acceptable per the instructions for proofs. The fatal issue is the mismatch in the exact statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it does not assert that f itself is the homeomorphism. A faithful Lean statement would produce a `Homeomorph X Y` whose `toFun` is definitionally or provably equal to f (e.g., `∃ e : Homeomorph X Y, e = ⟨f, _⟩` or directly define `Homeomorph.mk f …`).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Type _} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: We work with square matrices indexed by a finite type n with decidable equality.
- `theorem det_linear_in_row {R : Type _} [CommRing R] (A : Matrix n n R) (i : n) : ∀ (r s : n → R) (x y : R), Matrix.det (Function.update A i fun j => x * r j + y * s j) = x * Matrix.det (Function.update A i r) + y * Matrix.det (Function.update A i s) := ...`:
  This states: Over a commutative ring R, for any n×n matrix A and any row index i, the determinant is linear in the i-th row: replacing the i-th row by x·r + y·s gives det equal to x times det with i-th row r plus y times det with i-th row s, keeping other rows fixed. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is clear and standard.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement has two parts:
  (i) A combinatorial inequality: Given a subset S of matrix entries that always contains two entries in the same row or always contains two in the same column, the sum of absolute values of all determinant terms that use only entries from S is ≤ the sum of absolute values of all determinant terms that use all entries from S except one of them.
  (ii) Use this inequality to prove that the determinant is multilinear in the rows (linear in each row separately with others fixed).

The Lean code only states the conclusion (ii): multilinearity in a single row. It does not formalize or even mention the combinatorial inequality in (i), nor does it encode any reasoning “using this” to deduce linearity. Moreover, (i) involves absolute values and sums of absolute values of determinant terms, which suggests a setting like real or complex numbers (or a notion of absolute value), while the code works over an arbitrary commutative ring R and so cannot even express the absolute value inequality from (i). Thus the code omits an essential part of the natural language statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code captures only the final multilinearity property and ignores the combinatorial absolute-value inequality and the “use this to prove” structure. Hence the translation is not faithful to the full statement.

Additional notes:
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the single theorem is standard and meaningful. The presence of `sorry` indicates a missing proof, but the evaluation criterion focuses on whether the statement matches the natural language, not on proofs. The principal issue is the omission of the first (combinatorial) statement and any link between it and the multilinearity result.

However, because LocallySimplyConnected, fundamental_group, and FinitelyGenerated are uninterpreted placeholders not tied to the relevant structures (topology, basepoint, group), this is only a schematic statement, not a faithful formalization of the mathematical claim.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
Original NL: “Prove that the fundamental group of any compact, path connected, and locally simply connected topological space is finitely generated.”
What the theorem tries to say is aligned in broad outline: Hypotheses include compactness and path-connectedness as typeclasses, and a hypothesis h for local simple connectivity; the conclusion is that the fundamental group is finitely generated. But the formal objects used are not the mathlib ones:
- Locally simply connected should be a predicate on a topological space, not on the bare type. The code’s LocallySimplyConnected : Type -> Prop ignores the TopologicalSpace structure.
- The fundamental group in mathlib depends on a basepoint (π₁(X, x0)); the code’s fundamental_group : Type -> Type suppresses this and does not incorporate the topology. While path connectedness can make the group well-defined up to isomorphism regardless of basepoint, a faithful formalization should either include the basepoint or use the mathlib convention for FundamentalGroup X if available.
- “Finitely generated” is a property of a group structure (Group.fg G in mathlib), not of a bare type. The code’s FinitelyGenerated : Type -> Prop does not reflect this and does not require a Group instance.
- None of these placeholders are defined or tied to mathlib; they are vacuous symbols. By the auditing guideline, auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous placeholders.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code uses three arbitrary, uninterpreted placeholders in place of standard mathlib concepts, and crucial structural dependencies (topology for “locally simply connected,” basepoint and group structure for the fundamental group, group structure for finite generation) are missing. Even though the shape of the theorem mirrors the English sentence, it is not a faithful formalization using appropriate mathlib notions. Key differences:
- Missing dependence on the TopologicalSpace structure in the locally simply connected predicate.
- Missing basepoint dependence in the fundamental group (and no guarantee it is a group type at all).
- “Finitely generated” is stated for a type, not for a group, and does not use mathlib’s predicate.
- Not using mathlib names and structures is a red flag per the guidelines.
Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: Multiple vacuous placeholders; however, if these were replaced with proper mathlib notions (e.g., a correct LocallySimplyConnected predicate on topological spaces, FundamentalGroup with a basepoint or the standard mathlib wrapper, and Group.fg), the resulting statement would be faithful to the original. This warrants a 6 per the rubric.

- `theorem is_compact_of_is_closed_of_compact_space (hX : CompactSpace X) (hs : IsClosed s) : IsCompact s := by sorry`
  Translation: If X is a compact topological space (hX: CompactSpace X) and s is a closed subset of X (hs: IsClosed s), then s is compact as a subset of X (IsCompact s).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: ""Prove that a closed subset of a compact space is compact.""
The Lean theorem states exactly: given a compact space X and a closed subset s, then s is compact. In Mathlib, `IsCompact s` means the subset s is compact (with respect to the ambient space), which matches the usual mathematical meaning. No extraneous assumptions are added.

Step 3: Final check for differences.

- `theorem compact_space_prod_iff {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : (CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y) ↔ CompactSpace (X × Y) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for arbitrary types X and Y equipped with topological space structures. It states: “X is a compact space and Y is a compact space if and only if the product space X × Y is a compact space.”

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: “Topological spaces X and Y are both compact just when their product is compact.” This is exactly the logical equivalence encoded by `(CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y) ↔ CompactSpace (X × Y)`. The Lean code uses the standard Mathlib notion `CompactSpace` and the product `X × Y` with its canonical topology, matching the intended meaning.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The statement in Lean precisely matches the English statement: conjunction of compactness for X and Y iff compactness of the product. There are no extra hypotheses or missing qualifiers relative to the English phrasing. While in general topology one may note subtleties about emptiness affecting the truth of the converse, the natural language statement did not mention nonemptiness, and the Lean statement also does not; hence, as a translation, it is faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- `universe u v` sets universe levels for types.
- The theorem `prod_compact_iff_prod_of_compact_compact` states an equivalence (iff) between two statements:
  Left side: `∀ {ι : Type u} {X : ι → Type v} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)], CompactSpace (∀ i, X i)`
   • For every index type ι, for every family of types X indexed by ι, and for every choice of topologies on each X i, the product space (the dependent function type ∀ i, X i with the product topology) is compact. In words: every product of topological spaces is compact.
  Right side: `∀ {ι : Type u} {X : ι → Type v} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)], (∀ i, CompactSpace (X i)) → CompactSpace (∀ i, X i)`
   • For every index type ι, for every family of types X indexed by ι with topologies, if each X i is compact, then the product space (∀ i, X i) is compact. In words: every product of compact topological spaces is compact.
- `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; that's acceptable for translation auditing since we only assess the statement.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The natural language statement: ""Prove that every product of topological spaces is compact if and only if a product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
- The first clause (""every product of topological spaces is compact"") matches the left side exactly.
- The second clause (""a product of compact topological spaces is compact"") is naturally read in mathematics as a universal statement: for any family of compact spaces, their product is compact. The Lean right side captures precisely this universal form. The theorem's in-code docstring also clarifies this reading by explicitly saying ""every product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully formalizes the intended equivalence.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Quantification: The Lean code uses full universality over index sets and families, which aligns with the standard mathematical meaning. The only potential ambiguity in the English is the use of ""a product"" vs. ""every product"" in the second clause; however, in standard mathematical phrasing, ""a product of compact spaces is compact"" means the general (universal) statement, which the code matches. There are no auxiliary definitions or placeholders; everything is stated directly in terms of Mathlib’s `CompactSpace` and product (Pi) topology.
- Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

This is the standard definition of sequential compactness.
- `theorem compact_space_iff_sequentially_compact : CompactSpace X ↔ sequentially_compact_space X := by sorry`: This asserts that, for a metric space X, the space is compact (in the sense that X as a whole is compact, i.e., `CompactSpace X`) if and only if X is sequentially compact in the sense just defined.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: ""Prove that a metric space X is compact if and only if X is sequentially compact."" The Lean theorem states exactly the equivalence `CompactSpace X ↔ sequentially_compact_space X` under the assumption `[MetricSpace X]`. The definition `sequentially_compact_space X` matches the usual notion: every sequence has a convergent subsequence. The use of `Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)` is the standard Lean/Mathlib formalization of convergence of a sequence to x. The requirement `StrictMono φ` models a genuine subsequence.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The statement ""X is compact"" is represented by `CompactSpace X`, which is the standard Mathlib notion for the whole space being compact.
- The statement ""X is sequentially compact"" is represented by the newly defined `sequentially_compact_space X`, which faithfully captures the standard definition and is not vacuous.
- No auxiliary definitions are placeholders or vacuous; there are no `sorry` in definitions, only in the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Using a custom definition for sequential compactness rather than a built-in one is acceptable per the guidelines, since it faithfully encodes the intended property.
Thus, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

If f and g are continuous maps from X to Y, and the set of points where f and g agree, `{x | f x = g x}`, is dense in X, then f = g (as functions).

- Code assumptions match: X Hausdorff (T2Space X), Y arbitrary topological space, f and g continuous.
- “Agree on a dense subset” is captured by `Dense {x | f x = g x}`: the set where f and g agree is dense. This is logically equivalent to “there exists a dense subset D ⊆ X on which f = g,” since if f = g on a dense D, then the equalizer set contains D and is hence dense; conversely, the equalizer set itself is a dense subset where they agree.
- Conclusion f = g matches.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib classes and predicates are used: `T2Space`, `Continuous`, `Dense`.

3) Final check:
- The theorem statement in Lean is the same as the natural language statement in mathematical meaning. No differences in hypotheses or conclusion.

Note: While the mathematically true classical result typically assumes Y is Hausdorff (so the equalizer is closed), the given natural language statement assumes X is Hausdorff; the Lean code follows the given statement exactly. Our task is translation faithfulness, which is satisfied here.

- The conclusion `IsClosedMap f` is the correct formalization of ""f is closed."" The need for Y being Hausdorff is standard for the result to hold (images of compact sets are compact; compact sets are closed in Hausdorff spaces). However, as a translation of the given statement, this adds an extra assumption not present in the natural language version.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical problems are different: the Lean theorem proves the closedness under compact X and Hausdorff Y; the NL statement claims closedness under compact X alone (with no condition on Y), which is not generally true.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms (`IsClosedMap`, `Continuous`, `T2Space`) are standard Mathlib constructs. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the instructions since we are only auditing the statement, not the proof.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We have types X and Y equipped with topological space structures.
- `variable (path_conn_X : Prop) (path_conn_Y : Prop) (hausdorff_X : Prop) (hausdorff_Y : Prop)`: We postulate four arbitrary propositions named “X is path connected”, “Y is path connected”, “X is Hausdorff”, and “Y is Hausdorff”. These are just placeholders (arbitrary Props), not Mathlib’s actual notions `PathConnectedSpace X` or `T2Space X`.
- `variable (f : X → Y) (is_covering : Prop) (x0 : X) (y0 : Y) (hy0 : y0 = f x0)`: We have a function f: X → Y, an arbitrary proposition “is_covering” (again a placeholder, not Mathlib’s covering map predicate), basepoints x0 in X and y0 in Y, and the equation y0 = f x0.
- `variable (pi1_quot : Type*) (fiber_y0 : Type*) (map : pi1_quot → fiber_y0)`: We introduce an arbitrary type `pi1_quot` intended to represent π₁(Y,y₀)/f_*π₁(X,x₀), an arbitrary type `fiber_y0` intended to represent the fiber X_{y₀}, and an arbitrary function `map` between them. None of these are constructed from f, X, Y, etc., and no Mathlib definitions of π₁, quotient by a subgroup, or fiber are used.
- `theorem covering_map_cosets_bijective : Function.Bijective map := by sorry`: The theorem asserts that the arbitrary function `map` is bijective, with no hypotheses. No dependence on the earlier placeholders is expressed. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare to the original natural language statement.
Original: If X and Y are path connected Hausdorff topological spaces and f : X → Y is a covering map with y₀ = f(x₀), then the canonical map from π₁(Y,y₀)/f_*π₁(X,x₀) to the fiber X_{y₀} is bijective.

Issues:
- The code does not use Mathlib’s actual notions: no `PathConnectedSpace`, no `T2Space` (Hausdorff), no `CoveringMap`, no `FundamentalGroup`, no quotient group or cosets, no fiber definition as {x | f x = y₀}.
- The objects π₁(Y,y₀)/f_*π₁(X,x₀) and X_{y₀} are replaced by arbitrary Types `pi1_quot` and `fiber_y0`. There is no link between these Types and the given topological data.
- The “map” is an arbitrary function `map : pi1_quot → fiber_y0`, not the canonical map constructed from lifting theory. There is no requirement or construction tied to f.
- The theorem asserts bijectivity of `map` unconditionally, ignoring all hypotheses (path connectedness, Hausdorffness, covering map). This is strictly stronger and unrelated to the given statement, and it is not even conditionally formulated.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The Lean code states: “Given any types pi1_quot and fiber_y0 and any function map between them, map is bijective,” with no assumptions. The original states a specific bijectivity result under concrete topological hypotheses, for a specifically defined map between concretely defined mathematical objects. The code uses only placeholders, not Mathlib’s constructs, and the theorem does not even mention the hypotheses or the canonical map. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Additional red flags per guidelines:
- Heavy use of abstract placeholders instead of Mathlib notions is a red flag.
- The auxiliary placeholders are not even definitions but arbitrary variables, so the final theorem is divorced from the intended content.
- Even if the placeholders were replaced by legitimate definitions, the theorem’s statement would still be unfaithful because it (1) lacks hypotheses and (2) treats the map as arbitrary rather than the canonical one defined from the data. Thus it falls under the rubric level where fixing vacuity alone would not make it faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X is a type with a TopologicalSpace structure; x : X is a chosen basepoint.
- Hypothesis path_connected : PathConnectedSpace X — X is path connected.
- s : Set (Set X) — a collection of open subsets of X.
- hb : TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis s — s is a topological basis (in particular, every U ∈ s is open, and s generates the topology).
- hs_count : Countable s — s is countable.
- hs_simply : ∀ U ∈ s, SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U) — every basis element U, viewed with the subspace topology (the subtype type ↥U), is simply connected.
- Conclusion: Countable (FundamentalGroup X x) — the fundamental group of X at basepoint x is countable.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Let X be path connected and admit a countable basis of simply connected open sets. Show π1(X) is countable.
- The Lean theorem assumes an explicit basis s that is countable and consists of simply connected open sets, and concludes that the fundamental group at any specified basepoint x is countable. This is a standard formalization of “admits a countable basis”: instead of an existential assumption, the theorem is stated with an arbitrary such basis as a parameter. This is at least as strong and thus faithful to the original statement.
- The use of SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U) correctly encodes “U is simply connected (with the subspace topology).” IsTopologicalBasis ensures the U are open, matching “simply connected open sets.” PathConnectedSpace X matches the path connected hypothesis. The conclusion Countable (FundamentalGroup X x) matches “π1(X) is countable.” The dependence on a basepoint x is standard in Lean; path connectedness ensures basepoint independence up to isomorphism, so this is faithful.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only established Mathlib notions are used.

Final check: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the NL statement, with the minor (and acceptable) shift from an existential basis to an explicit parameter basis. There are no hidden mismatches.

It should quantify over `n : ℕ` (and perhaps acknowledge special handling of n = 0 vs n ≥ 1, though subsingleton is a reasonable formalization of ""trivial"").

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; the theorems are stated directly with `sorry` proofs, which is acceptable per the prompt.
- The first theorem is faithful.
- The second theorem is not faithful because it:
  1) Uses the wrong index type for homotopy groups (an arbitrary `Type v` instead of `ℕ`).
  2) Consequently, does not properly capture the standard family of homotopy groups π_n for n ∈ ℕ in mathlib.

Thus, the overall translation fails to be faithful because one of the two core claims is misstated relative to mathlib's definitions and the intended mathematical meaning.

Grade rationale: Significant but localized mismatch (wrong index type for homotopy groups). If corrected to `∀ n : ℕ, Subsingleton (HomotopyGroup n X x)`, the translation would be faithful. No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions were introduced. Hence a middling-to-high score, but not faithful: 7.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and set-theoretic notation; fine.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`: X and Y are types with topologies, and Y is Hausdorff (T2Space is Mathlib's standard class for Hausdorff spaces).
- The theorem `continuous_eq_on_dense {A : Set X} (hA : Dense A) {f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) (h : ∀ x ∈ A, f x = g x) : f = g` states: Given a subset A of X that is dense in X, and continuous functions f, g from X to Y that agree on A (i.e., for all x in A, f x = g x), then f = g. This matches the mathematical meaning that the two functions are equal everywhere on X.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses: X is a topological space, A ⊆ X is dense (captured by `Dense A`), Y is a Hausdorff space (`[T2Space Y]`), f and g are continuous (`Continuous f`, `Continuous g`), and they agree on A (`∀ x ∈ A, f x = g x`). All match precisely.
- Conclusion: `f = g` means the functions are equal, which is the intended conclusion. In Lean this is function equality (extensional equality via function extensionality), matching the NL statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is allowed per instructions since we're auditing the statement, not the proof.
- Mathlib terminology is standard and appropriate: `T2Space` for Hausdorff, `Dense`, `Continuous`.

Final check: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful translation of the natural language proposition with no discrepancies.

- The Lean statement exactly asserts that under `[T2Space Y]` (Hausdorff) and `hf : Continuous f`, `hg : Continuous g`, the set `{x | f x = g x}` is closed. This is precisely A being closed. All necessary structures are present ([TopologicalSpace X] so that closed sets on X make sense).

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not introduce any auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it states a single theorem. The set A is represented by a set-builder `{x | f x = g x}`, which matches the definition of A.

  States there is an equivalence of types between the deck_transformation_group and fundamental_group, with no hypotheses and with the body omitted (sorry). Not an isomorphism of groups; no mention of the action; no dependence on X or the assumed properties.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original: For a Hausdorff, path connected, locally simply connected space X, the deck transformation group of the universal covering space is precisely π1(X), acting by [x][y] = [x * y]. This asserts a canonical identification (group isomorphism) between the deck transformation group of the universal cover of X and the fundamental group π1(X), with an explicit description of the action via path concatenation.

The code does not:
- Encode the universal cover of X (no relation to X at all);
- Encode the deck transformation group as a group or as deck homeomorphisms of that cover;
- Encode π1(X) (no dependence on X/basepoint, and no group structure);
- Use the locally simply connected hypothesis (it merely declares an unused Prop);
- State a group isomorphism; it gives only an equivalence of types (Equiv) with a sorry body;
- Specify or use the action [x]·[y] = [x*y]. The action axiom is unused and unconstrained.

Step 3: Final comparison
The mathematical content is not faithfully represented. The code is almost entirely placeholders with no ties to X, no group structures, no covering-space notions, and the final statement is a bare type equivalence rather than a group isomorphism with the described action. This fails the faithfulness requirement by a wide margin.

Grade justification: Multiple vacuous placeholders; even if replaced by something, the final statement is the wrong notion (Equiv instead of group isomorphism) and lacks hypotheses and the specified action. Thus it fits the rubric around 3.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {V : Type _}`: Fix an arbitrary type V of vertices.
- `variable (G : SimpleGraph V)`: Consider a simple graph G on vertex type V.
- `variable [Fintype V]`: Assume V is finite (finitely many vertices). This implies there are finitely many edges since edges are a subset of V × V.
- `variable (fundamental_group : SimpleGraph V → Type _)`: Introduce an arbitrary function assigning to each simple graph a type, intended to represent its fundamental group, but not defined as such.
- `variable [∀ X : SimpleGraph V, Group (fundamental_group X)]`: Postulate that for every graph X, the assigned type `fundamental_group X` has a group structure. Again, this is an arbitrary structure unconnected to topology.
- `variable (IsConnected : SimpleGraph V → Prop)`: Introduce an arbitrary predicate on graphs, intended to mean “connected,” but not tied to Mathlib’s actual connectivity for graphs.
- Theorem statement: `theorem connected_finite_graph_fundamental_group_fg (h : IsConnected G) : ∃ (S : Type _) (hS : Fintype S) (φ : FreeGroup S →* fundamental_group G), Function.Surjective φ := by sorry`
  Natural language: If G satisfies the predicate IsConnected and V is finite, then there exists a finite type S and a surjective group homomorphism φ from the free group on S to `fundamental_group G`.

Comparison with the original statement:
- Original: “Prove that any connected finite graph has finitely generated fundamental group.” This refers to the topological fundamental group of the geometric realization of the graph (a 1-dimensional CW complex), and uses the standard notion of graph connectedness.
- Lean code issues:
  1) `fundamental_group` is an arbitrary function assigning a type to a graph, with no relation to the actual fundamental group of the graph’s topological realization. This is a placeholder and not a faithful Mathlib concept.
  2) `IsConnected` is an arbitrary predicate on graphs, not Mathlib’s notion of graph connectivity.
  3) No connection is made between graphs and topology (no geometric realization, no basepoint, no path-connectedness). The statement is about an arbitrary group attached to a connected graph, not the fundamental group.
  4) While the conclusion “∃ finite S and surjective `FreeGroup S →* …`” correctly encodes “finitely generated” for a group, it applies to the arbitrary `fundamental_group G`, not the true fundamental group.
- Minor: The theorem is stated for a fixed but arbitrary G and V with `[Fintype V]`, which is fine for “any connected finite graph.” Basepoint is omitted, but for connected spaces the fundamental group is well-defined up to isomorphism; however, since no topological structure is provided, this is moot.

Final check: The Lean statement is not the same as the natural language statement. It relies on vacuous placeholders (`fundamental_group`, `IsConnected`) rather than Mathlib’s actual definitions, and does not connect graphs to topology. Thus, it is not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale: The code makes up placeholder predicates/structures; however, if those placeholders were replaced with faithful Mathlib definitions (graph connectivity and the actual fundamental group of the geometric realization), the final theorem statement form (surjection from a free group on a finite set) would correctly express “finitely generated.” Hence, it merits a mid score.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `class LocallySimplyConnectedSpace (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := (dummy : True)`
  This defines a typeclass intended to mean ""locally simply connected,"" but it is vacuous: it holds trivially for all spaces because it just requires `True`. This is a placeholder and does not faithfully capture local simple connectivity.

- `def IsCoveringMapPlaceholder {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : Y → X) : Prop := True`
  This defines a predicate intended to mean ""p is a covering map,"" but it is also vacuous: it is always true for any map. This is not the Mathlib definition and does not capture the covering map property at all.

- The theorem
  `theorem exists_universal_cover {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [PathConnectedSpace X]
  [LocallySimplyConnectedSpace X] :
  ∃ (Y : Type*) (tY : TopologicalSpace Y) (p : Y → X), IsCoveringMapPlaceholder (p) ∧ SimplyConnectedSpace Y := by sorry`
  Informally: For any topological space X that is path connected and (placeholder-)locally simply connected, there exists a type Y with a topological structure and a map p : Y → X such that the (placeholder) covering map predicate holds (which is trivially true) and Y is simply connected. The proof is omitted.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The original statement: ""Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space X has a universal covering space \(\tilde{X} \to X\)."" A universal cover is (equivalently) a simply connected covering space over X. So the intended formalization should assert the existence of Y with a genuine topological space structure and a map p : Y → X that is a genuine covering map (as per Mathlib), together with Y being simply connected.

- Problems in the code:
  1) LocallySimplyConnectedSpace is defined vacuously as True. This is a placeholder and not a faithful definition.
  2) IsCoveringMapPlaceholder is also vacuously True, not Mathlib's notion of covering map.
  3) Because the covering map predicate is True, the theorem only asserts: there exists some simply connected space Y and some map p : Y → X. This is far weaker than asserting p is a covering map. It does not capture the universal cover property at all.
  4) The code does not use Mathlib’s covering map definitions, violating the guideline to use applicable Mathlib terms. This is a red flag.
  5) Even if we ignore proofs (which are omitted), the auxiliary definitions are vacuous placeholders; hence the statement does not faithfully encode the intended math.

- If the placeholders were replaced by faithful definitions (a genuine LocallySimplyConnectedSpace and Mathlib’s covering map predicate), the theorem statement would match the intended mathematical meaning: existence of a simply connected covering map Y → X for path connected, locally simply connected X. In that sense, the shape of the theorem is close, but as written it is not faithful due to vacuous predicates.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same. The Lean code’s statement is much weaker and relies on vacuous placeholders for the key notions. It does not assert the existence of a universal covering space in any meaningful sense.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definitions invalidate faithfulness, but if those were made legitimate, the final theorem would be a faithful translation. This corresponds to a grade around 6 per the rubric.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- `open Set` allows Set-specific notations and names without qualification.
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X}` declares a type X equipped with a topological space structure, and a subset A of X.
- `theorem dense_iff_closure_eq_univ : Dense A ↔ closure A = (univ : Set X) := by sorry` states the theorem: A is dense in X if and only if the closure of A equals the universal set (the whole space) as a set of X. The `sorry` is a placeholder for the proof, which is acceptable for our translation audit.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: Let X be a topological space. A subset A ⊆ X is dense in X iff closure(A) = X.
- In Lean, `Dense A` is the standard Mathlib predicate for density of A in X, and `(univ : Set X)` denotes the whole space X viewed as a set. Thus `closure A = univ` matches “the closure of A is X.”
- The variables and context match exactly: X is a topological space, A is a subset of X.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem statement directly encodes the claim.

Final check: The two statements are the same. There are no discrepancies. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (`Dense`, `closure`, `univ`) appropriately.

  Natural language:
  Let X and Y be types with topological space structures. Assume additionally that X is nonempty, and that Y is Hausdorff (i.e., T2). Let f : X → Y be a function which is continuous and bijective. Then the function invFun f : Y → X is continuous. (Proof omitted.)

Notes:
- `T2Space Y` expresses that Y is Hausdorff.
- `Continuous (Function.invFun f)` asserts continuity of a chosen inverse-like function invFun. Under bijectivity, invFun agrees with the genuine inverse function (pointwise), though in Lean it is presented as the canonical choice-based inverse. 
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: If f : X → Y is a continuous bijection from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y, then the inverse f^{-1} : Y → X is continuous.
- Lean statement: Same, except it additionally assumes `[Nonempty X]` and uses `Function.invFun f` to represent the inverse.

About invFun vs f^{-1}: For a bijection, invFun coincides with the true inverse, so that part is acceptable as a faithful representation.

3) Final check for differences:
- Extra hypothesis: The Lean theorem assumes `[Nonempty X]`. This is not present in the natural language statement. In fact, the empty case (X and Y both empty) is allowed by the NL statement and the conclusion still makes sense (the inverse is continuous). The added nonemptiness requirement is a genuine strengthening/restriction, so the Lean statement is not fully faithful.
- Hausdorffness via `T2Space Y` and continuity/bijectivity match the NL statement otherwise.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions were introduced; the only gap is the `sorry` proof, which is permitted for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The translation is almost correct but not fully faithful due to the extra `[Nonempty X]` assumption.

- `import Mathlib` and `open TopologicalSpace`: standard imports/opener.
- Docstring claims: the one-point compactification of R^n (written as `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))`) is homeomorphic to the n-sphere (unit sphere in R^{n+1}).
- `def one_point_compactification_Rn_homeo_Sn (n : ℕ) ... : Homeomorph (WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))) ({ x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1)) // ‖x‖ = 1 }) := by sorry`
  • This declares a definition producing a specific homeomorphism between the types `(WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)))` and the subtype `{x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1)) // ‖x‖ = 1}` (the unit sphere), with the proof/content omitted via `sorry`.
  • It also includes instance parameters `[TopologicalSpace (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))]` and `[TopologicalSpace ({ x : ... // ‖x‖ = 1 })]`, which are redundant because these instances already exist, but not inherently wrong.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The NL statement: ""Prove that the one point compactification of R^n is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n."" This is the standard result that `OnePoint (ℝ^n)` is homeomorphic to the unit sphere in `ℝ^{n+1}`.
- The code uses `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))` to represent the one-point compactification. This is incorrect in Mathlib/topology: the topological one-point compactification is `OnePoint α`, not `WithTop α`. `WithTop` is an order-theoretic construction (adding a top element) and does not carry the canonical one-point compactification topology; indeed, Mathlib provides the correct topological construction as `OnePoint α` together with its topology.
- Furthermore, the type `Homeomorph (WithTop (EuclideanSpace ...)) (...)` presupposes a `TopologicalSpace` instance on `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ...)`. There is no canonical such instance in Mathlib tied to the one-point compactification; the code does not supply one either. So even if it compiles (by some global instance or placeholder), it does not faithfully specify the intended topology.
- The codomain sphere is modeled as `{x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1)) // ‖x‖ = 1}`, which is a correct model of `S^n`. This part is fine.
- The statement is a `def` of a specific homeomorphism, which is stronger than an existence theorem but still acceptable as a faithful formalization if the types were correct. However, because the domain uses `WithTop` instead of `OnePoint`, it is not the same mathematical object.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- Original: homeomorphism between the one-point compactification of ℝ^n and S^n.
- Code: homeomorphism between `WithTop (ℝ^n)` (with unspecified or nonstandard topology) and the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}.
- Key difference: `WithTop` ≠ `OnePoint` as a topological construction. This is a substantive mismatch. Hence the translation is not faithful.
- Minor issues: unnecessary instance parameters; proof omitted via `sorry` is acceptable for translation checking, but the main issue remains the wrong domain type.

Conclusion: Not faithful. To fix: replace `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ...)` with `OnePoint (EuclideanSpace ...)` (or `OnePoint (Fin n → ℝ)`), and rely on the existing TopologicalSpace instances; optionally use Mathlib's `sphere (0 : _) 1` subtype for S^n.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language and assess.
- import Mathlib; open Set: Setup only.
- def SmoothManifold (M : Type _) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate asserting “M is a smooth manifold,” but it is defined as True, so it carries no content and does not use Mathlib’s manifold structures (e.g., ChartedSpace, Smooth structure). Red flag.
- def SmoothPath {M} (x : Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 → M) : Prop := True: Placeholder predicate for “x is a smooth path,” again defined as True. No continuity or differentiability is enforced. Red flag.
- def HomotopicRel {M} (x y : Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 → M) (S : Set ℝ) : Prop := True: Placeholder predicate for “x and y are homotopic relative to S,” also True. No actual homotopy or relative boundary condition is encoded. Red flag.
- theorem path_homotopic_to_smooth (M : Type _) (hM : SmoothManifold M) (x : Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 → M) : ∃ y : Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 → M, SmoothPath y ∧ HomotopicRel x y ({0,1} : Set ℝ) := by sorry: Claims that for any type M with SmoothManifold M (vacuous) and any function x from [0,1] to M, there exists y with SmoothPath y (vacuous) and x,y are HomotopicRel {0,1} (vacuous). The proof is a sorry (placeholder). Even ignoring the sorry, the statement is trivialized by the vacuous predicates.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let M be a smooth manifold and x:[0,1]→M be a path (i.e., continuous). Prove that x is homotopic relative to {0,1} to a smooth path.
Lean code attempts to state: For any type M labeled as a “smooth manifold” (but vacuous), and any function x:[0,1]→M (no continuity assumed), there exists y:[0,1]→M such that y is “smooth” (vacuous) and x,y are “homotopic rel {0,1}” (vacuous). This does not faithfully encode the manifold structure, the notion of path (continuity), smoothness, or homotopy. Moreover, the theorem uses maps Icc→M rather than Path or ContinuousMap and imposes no continuity on x.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Smooth manifold: Code uses a vacuous True predicate instead of Mathlib’s smooth manifold structure. Not faithful.
- Path: The NL statement requires x to be a path (continuous); the code allows any function. Not faithful and strictly stronger (and false) if proper definitions were used.
- Smooth path: Code’s SmoothPath is vacuous; doesn’t ensure smoothness or even continuity.
- Homotopy relative {0,1}: Code’s HomotopicRel is vacuous; does not enforce existence of a continuous homotopy fixing endpoints.
- Auxiliary defs are all vacuous placeholders, violating the guideline that they must be faithful.
- The proof is left as sorry, but per the auditing task we focus on translation fidelity; still, the vacuous placeholders alone force failure.
Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation. Even if the placeholders were replaced by real definitions, the statement would still be off because x is not assumed to be a continuous path. Hence it fails more severely than merely using placeholders.

Grade rationale: Multiple vacuous placeholders and a critical mismatch (x not required to be a path). Thus faithful_score = 0 and grade = 3 per rubric.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The NL statement: “Let X be a Hausdorff topological space and Y any compact topological space. Prove that the first projection X × Y → X is a closed map.”
- Correspondence:
  - Hausdorff on X ↔ `[T2Space X]` ✓

  - Topological spaces on X, Y ↔ `[TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]` ✓
  - First projection X × Y → X ↔ `Prod.fst : X × Y → X` ✓

- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof stub, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions (T2Space, CompactSpace, IsClosedMap, Prod.fst), not placeholders.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {P Q : Type*} [TopologicalSpace P] [TopologicalSpace Q]`: We work with arbitrary topological spaces P and Q.
- The theorem `proper_local_homeomorph_is_covering_map (f : P → Q) (hf : IsProperMap f) (hl : IsLocalHomeomorph f) (hq : ConnectedSpace Q) : IsCoveringMap f` states: If f is a proper map and a local homeomorphism, and Q is connected, then f is a covering map.
There are no auxiliary definitions; all predicates are standard Mathlib notions (IsProperMap, IsLocalHomeomorph, ConnectedSpace, IsCoveringMap).

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
Original: ""Every proper local diffeomorphism f : P → Q between manifolds without boundary, with Q connected, is a covering map.""
Key hypotheses present in the natural statement:
- P and Q are smooth manifolds without boundary.
- f is a local diffeomorphism (smooth, with smooth inverse locally), hence in particular a local homeomorphism.
- Q is connected.
- Conclusion: f is a covering map.

Key hypotheses in the Lean code:
- P and Q are arbitrary topological spaces (no manifold structure, no boundary condition, no smoothness).
- f is a proper map and a local homeomorphism.
- Q is connected.
- Conclusion: f is a covering map.

3) Faithfulness check and differences:
- Category mismatch: The original statement is in the smooth manifold category (manifolds without boundary, local diffeomorphism). The Lean code is purely topological (TopologicalSpace, local homeomorphism), with no manifold/smooth structure or boundary conditions. This is a significant difference.
- Strengthening/generalization: A local diffeomorphism between manifolds is indeed a local homeomorphism, so the Lean hypotheses are weaker/more general on the structural side (no manifold needed), making the statement strictly stronger than the original. This is not a faithful translation; it proves a more general theorem rather than the stated one.
- The “without boundary” condition is missing entirely. While this may not be necessary in the topological formulation, it is part of the original and thus omitted.
- Properness and connectedness of Q match the original assumptions (proper map, connected target). However, connectedness is not required to define a covering map; it's included in both, so that's fine, but it does not compensate for the missing manifold/smooth structure.
- No vacuous placeholders: the code uses Mathlib's real definitions, and there are no fake auxiliary definitions. The issue is not vacuity but mismatch of the mathematical context and hypotheses.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is not a faithful translation; it is a broader topological theorem about proper local homeomorphisms, not specifically about proper local diffeomorphisms between manifolds without boundary. Therefore, it fails the strict faithfulness requirement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the full Mathlib environment.
- `universe u v` sets universe levels for types `X` and `Y`.
- `theorem quotient_topology_is_pseudometrizable {X : Type u} {Y : Type v} [MetricSpace X] (f : X → Y) (hf : Function.Surjective f) : ... := by sorry`
  States: Let `X` be a metric space and `f : X → Y` be a surjective map. Then there exists a `PseudoMetricSpace` structure `m` on `Y` such that the topology arising from the uniform space induced by this pseudometric on `Y` is equal to the coinduced (quotient) topology on `Y` via `f` from the topology induced by the pseudometric coming from `X`’s metric. In Mathlib notation: `∃ (m : PseudoMetricSpace Y), TopologicalSpace.of (toUniformSpace m) = TopologicalSpace.coinduced f (TopologicalSpace.of (toUniformSpace (MetricSpace.toPseudoMetricSpace X)))`. The proof is omitted with `sorry` (which is acceptable here since we only audit the statement).

- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
Natural language: “Let f : X → Y be a surjective map, where X is a metric space. Prove that the quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric on Y.”

Lean theorem: It asserts the quotient topology arises from a pseudometric on Y (existence of a `PseudoMetricSpace` structure inducing exactly the coinduced topology).

3) Are they the same?
- Key difference: metric vs pseudometric. The Lean code claims pseudometrizability, not metrizability. This is a strictly weaker claim: every metric induces a pseudometric, but not every pseudometric topology is metrizable (pseudometrics can identify distinct points at distance 0, yielding non-T0/non-Hausdorff spaces; metric spaces are T1/Hausdorff). Thus the Lean statement does not faithfully translate the natural language claim.
- The rest (surjectivity, coinduced topology as the quotient topology, use of standard Mathlib bridges via UniformSpace) is appropriate and faithful to the quotient-topology aspect.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it downgrades “metric” to “pseudometric,” which is a significant logical weakening. No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the mismatch is solely in the strength of the topological structure claimed to exist.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The module docstring explains the intended statement: classify spaces X that admit ℝ as a covering space: X is homeomorphic to ℝ or to the circle.
- `open TopologicalSpace`: Open the TopologicalSpace namespace (no effect on the statement).
- The theorem `covering_spaces_of_real {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] (p : ℝ → X) (hp : IsCoveringMap p) : (Nonempty (Homeomorph X ℝ)) ∨ (Nonempty (Homeomorph X Circle)) := by sorry` states: For any topological space X, any map p : ℝ → X that is a covering map, X is homeomorphic to ℝ or to the circle. The use of `Nonempty (Homeomorph X ℝ)` and `Nonempty (Homeomorph X Circle)` expresses “X is homeomorphic to ℝ” or “X is homeomorphic to S¹,” respectively. `IsCoveringMap` is the Mathlib predicate for p being a covering map. No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is allowed for this task.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the only topological spaces with ℝ as a covering space are ℝ and S¹.” This means: If X admits a covering map from ℝ, then X is (up to homeomorphism) ℝ or S¹.
- The Lean statement: For any given p : ℝ → X with `IsCoveringMap p`, X is homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹. This is a standard, slightly stronger universal conditional form, but it captures the same classification content: any space that has ℝ as a covering space must be homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Concepts used are standard Mathlib notions (`IsCoveringMap`, `Homeomorph`, `Circle`), no vacuous or fake definitions.
- The logical form is a universal conditional in p, which implies the existential-conditional phrasing of the natural language. Since the conclusion does not depend on p, this is a faithful rendition of the classification statement.
- No mismatches in mathematical meaning: The code says exactly that a space covered by ℝ is homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem proper_iff_compact_fibers_and_closed {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) [T2Space Y] :` sets up: X and Y are topological spaces, Y is Hausdorff, f : X → Y is given, and there is a hypothesis `hf : Continuous f`.
- The statement is `IsProperMap f ↔ (∀ y, IsCompact (f ⁻¹' ({y} : Set Y))) ∧ IsClosedMap f`.
  This says: f is a proper map if and only if every fiber `f^{-1}({y})` is compact and f is a closed map.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let f : X → Y be a continuous map to a Hausdorff space Y. Prove that f is proper iff (a) every fiber is compact, and (b) f is a closed map.”
- The Lean statement assumes Y is Hausdorff and includes a continuity hypothesis `hf : Continuous f`, matching the natural language context.
- The RHS exactly encodes conditions (a) and (b): compact fibers via `IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})` and closedness via `IsClosedMap f`.

Potential mismatch to flag (being extra harsh):
- Whether the Lean proposition truly matches the NL hypothesis hinges on the definition of `IsProperMap` in Mathlib. In Mathlib, `IsProperMap f` commonly denotes the property “preimage of compact sets is compact” and does not itself include continuity. If so, the theorem as stated does not use the continuity assumption `hf` in the type of the equivalence; it asserts the equivalence regardless of continuity. The natural language statement, however, explicitly assumes f is continuous. So the code’s statement would be strictly stronger than the NL statement (no continuity needed), hence not logically equivalent.
- If, on the other hand, `IsProperMap f` in Mathlib already bundles continuity into the notion of properness (i.e., means “f is continuous and preimages of compact sets are compact”), then the code is a faithful translation, with `hf` simply redundant.

Given standard Mathlib naming conventions (e.g., `IsClosedMap`, `IsOpenMap` do not include continuity), it is more likely that `IsProperMap` also does not include continuity. Therefore, the Lean statement is slightly stronger than the NL statement, since it does not require continuity in the equivalence itself. The presence of an unused `hf` in the binder list does not restrict the statement. Everything else (Hausdorff target, compact fibers, closedness) matches perfectly.

Final check: The two statements are almost the same but not exactly: the Lean statement omits continuity from the equivalence (very likely), making it stronger than the NL statement. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; Mathlib notions are used appropriately.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Metric` bring in Mathlib and the metric space notions including `dist` and metric balls.
- The main declaration is:
  `def homeomorph_R2_open_ball (a : ℝ × ℝ) (r : ℝ) (hr : 0 < r) : Homeomorph (ℝ × ℝ) {x : ℝ × ℝ // dist x a < r} := by sorry`
  This states: for any center `a : ℝ × ℝ` and any radius `r > 0`, there is (we explicitly provide) a homeomorphism between the whole plane `(ℝ × ℝ)` and the subtype `{x : ℝ × ℝ // dist x a < r}` consisting of points whose distance to `a` is strictly less than `r`, where `dist` is the metric on `ℝ × ℝ` coming from its standard instance in Mathlib.

Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement says: “Prove that the Euclidean plane ℝ^2 is homeomorphic to any open ball in ℝ^2.” This is typically understood with the Euclidean metric (the ℓ2 norm) on ℝ^2, so “open ball” means a round Euclidean open disk of radius r > 0.
- In the Lean code, the ambient space is `ℝ × ℝ` with its standard Mathlib metric. On `ℝ × ℝ`, Mathlib’s default norm/metric is the product/sup norm/metric (i.e., dist is the sup metric), not the Euclidean ℓ2 metric. Consequently, the set `{x : ℝ × ℝ // dist x a < r}` is an open ball with respect to the sup metric (an open square in usual geometry), not a round Euclidean disk.

Assessment:
- Positives: The quantification over any center `a` and any radius `r > 0` matches “any open ball.” Stating a `Homeomorph` is the right formalization (and even stronger than mere existence). Using the subtype for the open ball is standard.
- Critical mismatch: The “open ball” in the code is with respect to the default metric on `ℝ × ℝ` (the sup metric), whereas the English statement refers to the Euclidean plane and hence the Euclidean metric (ℓ2 norm). These balls are not the same subsets. While both kinds of balls are open and each is homeomorphic to ℝ^2, the formalized statement is not literally the same as the natural-language statement. Under the auditing standard, this is a nontrivial difference.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions: There are no fake placeholder definitions like `:= True` etc. The `sorry` is in the body of the main declaration, which is allowed for our translation audit.

Final check: The two math problems are different. The Lean code asserts a homeomorphism with a sup-metric ball in `ℝ × ℝ`. The natural language asserts a homeomorphism with a Euclidean-metric ball in ℝ^2. Despite topological equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, the specific set “open ball” is different in the two contexts. Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful.

The ε-δ condition is expressed using the ambient distances in `E` and `F`. Since the subtype metrics coincide with the restricted ambient metrics in Mathlib, this is the usual ε-δ criterion for maps between the subspaces.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If X and Y are subsets of Euclidean spaces with the subspace topologies, then f : X → Y is continuous (preimages of open sets are open) iff f is continuous in the usual ε-δ sense.
- The code asserts the same equivalence but in a more general setting: `E` and `F` are arbitrary metric spaces, not necessarily Euclidean. Domains and codomains are subspaces `s ⊆ E` and `t ⊆ F`, with the subspace topologies. The ε-δ condition is formulated with distances in the ambient spaces; this is equivalent to the subspace metric formulation.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Main difference: The code is strictly more general (arbitrary metric spaces) than the statement (Euclidean spaces). While the result is true in this more general setting, this is not a faithful translation of the original statement as it strengthens the assumptions. Under the auditing guidelines, this counts as a mismatch.
- Otherwise, the logical form (an iff between topological continuity and ε-δ continuity at every point) and the use of subspace topologies/metrics are correct and precise.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no vacuous placeholders. The coercions `((f y : F) : F)` are redundant but harmless.

Conclusion: The statement is almost the same mathematically but is more general than requested (metric spaces vs Euclidean spaces). Hence it is not a faithful translation under the strict criteria.

- Conclusion: IsNowhereDense (range f) states that the image f(M) is a nowhere dense subset of N.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- NL: Let φ : P → Q be a smooth map of manifolds with dim P < dim Q. Show φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.
- Code: For f : M → N smooth between manifolds modeled by I, I', with Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E', the image range f is nowhere dense in N. This matches the structure of the statement: smooth map between manifolds, dimension inequality, and conclusion about nowhere density of the image.

Step 3: Check for differences or red flags
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement with a proof hole (by sorry), which is permitted by the task.
- Minor discrepancies:
  - The base field is any NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜, not specifically ℝ. The natural language typically defaults to real smooth manifolds. This is a generalization, not a weakening; it does not mis-state the original claim.
  - The dimension comparison uses Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E', rather than explicitly asserting finite-dimensional manifold dimensions. This is a standard way in mathlib to express manifold dimension, but it does not impose finite-dimensionality; again, this is a generalization.
  - The code assumes ChartedSpace structures and uses ContMDiff to encode smoothness. It does not explicitly require SmoothManifoldWithCorners typeclasses for M and N, but the smoothness predicate ContMDiff is stated relative to the given atlases, which is the usual mathlib setup for smooth manifolds. This is acceptable for stating “smooth map of manifolds.”

Overall judgment
- The theorem statement in Lean faithfully captures the mathematical content of the natural language statement: a smooth map between manifolds with dim domain < dim codomain has image nowhere dense. The small generalizations (arbitrary 𝕜, not explicitly finite-dimensional, relying on ChartedSpace + ContMDiff) do not change the mathematical meaning of the statement and are standard in mathlib. No vacuous placeholders or misleading auxiliary definitions appear.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful, with only minor generalizations that do not detract from correctness of the translation.

",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and namespace openings are standard.
- The theorem `paths_concat_defined_iff {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] (x y z : C(↑unitInterval, X)) : ((x.toFun 1 = y.toFun 0) ∧ (y.toFun 1 = z.toFun 0)) ↔ ((x.toFun 1 = y.toFun 0) ∧ (y.toFun 1 = z.toFun 0))` states: for continuous maps x, y, z from the unit interval to X, the conjunction of endpoint equalities x(1) = y(0) and y(1) = z(0) is logically equivalent to itself. This is a tautology A ↔ A. There is no mention in the formal statement of concatenation or of the notion “is defined.” The comment above the theorem says that the concatenations are defined exactly when those endpoint equalities hold, but this is not encoded in the theorem; it’s only a docstring.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The natural language statement: “Let X be a topological space and let x,y,z : [0,1] → X be paths. Prove that (x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.” This concerns the definability of concatenations of paths, i.e., whether the endpoint conditions needed for the concatenations hold. Formally, one would expect a statement equating the definability of (x*y)*z with that of x*(y*z), typically phrased in terms of endpoint equalities or via an actual concatenation operation whose domain condition enforces these equalities.
- The Lean theorem does not mention concatenation at all, nor a predicate expressing “is defined.” It simply asserts (x(1)=y(0) ∧ y(1)=z(0)) ↔ (x(1)=y(0) ∧ y(1)=z(0)), which is a tautology and does not capture the equivalence between the definability of the two concatenations. The connection to concatenation exists only in the comment, which is not formal content.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The original compares definability of two concatenations; the Lean statement is an identity A ↔ A with no mention of concatenation or definability. Even if one knows (externally) that concatenation is defined exactly under these endpoint equalities, the theorem as stated does not tie the equivalence to concatenation; it is not a formalization of “(x*y)*z defined iff x*(y*z) defined.” It is strictly weaker and, as written, trivial.
- Additional minor concern: the code uses `C(↑unitInterval, X)` and `x.toFun 1`. While this might compile depending on instances, it’s not the standard way to formalize paths or concatenation in Mathlib (which has a `Path` structure and path concatenation). This suggests further divergence from the intended statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's topology library.
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: Let X be a type equipped with a topological space structure.
- `variable {A : Set X}`: Let A be a subset of X.
- `theorem boundary_eq_closure_inter_closure_complement : frontier A = closure A ∩ closure (Aᶜ) := by sorry`: This states the theorem: the frontier (boundary) of A equals the intersection of the closure of A with the closure of the complement of A.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: For any topological space X and subset A, prove ∂A = Ȧ ∩ cl(X − A). Here X − A denotes the set-theoretic difference, i.e., the complement of A in X.
- Lean: Uses `frontier A` for ∂A, `closure A` for Ȧ, and `closure (Aᶜ)` for cl(X − A). In Mathlib, `Aᶜ` is the complement of A in X. Thus, `closure (Aᶜ)` is exactly the closure of X − A.
- Therefore, the statement matches exactly.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Terminology: ""boundary"" vs `frontier` — these are the same in Mathlib.
- Complement: ""X − A"" vs `Aᶜ` — same notion in the ambient space X.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Context: Γ is a group, X is a metric space with a Γ-action (MulAction Γ X). This matches the setting of a group action on a metric space.
- def isometric_action := ∀ g : Γ, Isometry (fun x : X => g • x)
  Meaning: The action is by isometries: each group element acts as an isometry on X.
- def covering_action : Prop := ∀ x : X, ∃ U : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ ∀ g : Γ, g ≠ 1 → (image (fun y => g • y) U ∩ U) = ∅
  Meaning: For every point x, there is an open neighborhood U of x such that for every nontrivial group element g, the translate g • U is disjoint from U. This is the standard local disjointness (evenly covered) condition that characterizes a covering action.
- def free_action : Prop := ∀ g : Γ, g ≠ 1 → ∀ x : X, g • x ≠ x
  Meaning: The action is free: no nontrivial element fixes any point.
- def discrete_orbits : Prop := ∀ x : X, ∃ ε > 0, ∀ g : Γ, g • x ≠ x → dist (g • x) x ≥ ε
  Meaning: Each orbit is discrete: around each point x there’s a positive radius separating x from all other points in its orbit. This is equivalent to the orbit being a discrete subset in a metric space.
- theorem covering_action_iff_free_and_discrete_orbits (h_iso : isometric_action Γ X) : covering_action Γ X ↔ (free_action Γ X ∧ discrete_orbits Γ X) := by sorry
  Meaning: Assuming the action is by isometries, the action is a covering action if and only if it is free and has discrete orbits. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement matches the intended theorem.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Suppose X is a metric space and Γ acts on X by isometries. Prove that Γ acts on X as a covering action iff the action is free with discrete orbits.
- The hypothesis “acts by isometries” is encoded as h_iso : isometric_action Γ X.
- “Acts on X as a covering action” is encoded by covering_action Γ X, using the standard local disjointness condition (evenly covered neighborhoods). This is a faithful formalization of covering action in this context.
- “Free with discrete orbits” is encoded by free_action Γ X ∧ discrete_orbits Γ X. Both are standard and correctly formulated in the metric setting.
- The result is stated as an iff, exactly as in the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check for mismatches or red flags
- No vacuous placeholders: all definitions are concrete and meaningful.
- The isometric assumption is present as a hypothesis to the theorem, matching the problem statement.
- The covering_action definition uses g • U ∩ U = ∅ for all g ≠ 1. This is equivalent to pairwise disjoint translates of U, because for g1 ≠ g2, (g2⁻¹ g1) • U ∩ U = ∅ implies g1 • U ∩ g2 • U = ∅. So the definition is appropriate.
- Discrete_orbits is correctly captured via a uniform positive lower bound on distances from x to g • x for g • x ≠ x, which yields isolation of x in its orbit, and since the condition is for all x, each point in every orbit is isolated. This matches the intended meaning of discrete orbits in metric spaces.
- While Mathlib has related concepts (e.g., IsFreeSMul), the custom definitions here are faithful and non-vacuous, which is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No extraneous or misleading auxiliary definitions are present.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully states the exact theorem described in the natural language, with appropriate and standard definitions. No substantive discrepancies found.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib, open Set: Bring in mathlib and set-theoretic notation.

First declaration:
- def closed_injective_homeomorph_range {X Y} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] {f : X → Y} (hf_cont : Continuous f) (hf_closed : IsClosedMap f) (h_inj : Function.Injective f) : Homeomorph X (Subtype (range f)) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any topological spaces X and Y and any function f : X → Y that is continuous, a closed map, and injective, there exists a homeomorphism between X and the image of f in Y (formalized as the subtype of Y consisting of points in range f). This exactly asserts “a closed injective continuous map is a homeomorphism onto its image.”

Second declaration:
- def proper_injective_homeomorph_range {X Y} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y] {f : X → Y} (hf_cont : Continuous f) (h_proper : IsProperMap f) (h_inj : Function.Injective f) : Homeomorph X (Subtype (range f)) := by sorry
  Natural language: If Y is locally compact and Hausdorff, and f : X → Y is continuous, proper, and injective, then there is a homeomorphism between X and the image of f. This matches “any proper injection into a locally compact Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism onto its image.”

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: “Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Prove that any closed injection f : X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image. In particular, any proper injection f : X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image.”
- The Lean code provides two results:
  1) A closed injective continuous map is a homeomorphism onto its image, with no hypothesis on Y. This captures the first claim (and is even stronger, since it does not assume Y is LCH). It explicitly assumes continuity, which is necessary for the conclusion to even make sense.
  2) Under [LocallyCompactSpace Y] and [T2Space Y] (Hausdorff), it asserts that a proper injective continuous map is a homeomorphism onto its image. This matches the “in particular” clause.
- The target “onto its image” is formalized as Homeomorph X (Subtype (range f)), which is standard in Mathlib.
- The concepts used (Continuous, IsClosedMap, Injective, IsProperMap, LocallyCompactSpace, T2Space, Homeomorph) are standard Mathlib notions. No auxiliary fake definitions appear; no vacuous placeholders are introduced. The `sorry` only hides proofs, which is acceptable per instructions.

Step 3: Final comparison and any differences.
- Differences:
  • The first Lean declaration does not assume Y is locally compact Hausdorff; the original phrasing places that assumption at the start, but it is not needed for the first conclusion. This makes the Lean statement strictly stronger, but does not conflict with the intended meaning.
  • The Lean code explicitly assumes continuity in both parts. The original text says “closed injection” and “proper injection” without stating continuity. In standard usage, “proper map” includes continuity, and to talk about a homeomorphism onto its image, continuity of f is necessary. Thus making continuity explicit is natural and faithful.
  • In the second statement, both hf_cont : Continuous f and h_proper : IsProperMap f are assumed; if IsProperMap already entails continuity in Mathlib, then hf_cont is redundant, but this does not change the meaning.
- No other discrepancies: the mathematical content aligns with the original claims; the image is correctly represented; the Hausdorff and locally compact assumptions are placed where needed for the “proper implies closed” route.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are faithful to the natural language statement, with the minor (benign) strengthening of hypotheses for the first claim and explicit continuity hypotheses.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- variable {X Y Γ : Type*}: Declares three arbitrary types X, Y, Γ. No additional structure (no MetricSpace on X, no Group structure on Γ, no action Γ ↷ X, etc.)
- def FreeAction : Prop := True: Introduces a proposition named FreeAction, but defines it as True (vacuous/opaque). It has no parameters, so it does not even refer to X, Γ, or an action.
- def IsometricAction : Prop := True: Another vacuous proposition, parameterless, not tied to X, Γ, or a metric.
- def DiscreteOrbits : Prop := True: Again vacuous, parameterless; does not specify orbits of any action, nor a topology/metric.
- def IsQuotientMapForAction (q : X → Y) : Prop := True: Vacuous predicate about a map q; does not refer to Γ or any action; always True.
- def LocallyIsometricCoveringMap (q : X → Y) : Prop := True: Vacuous predicate; does not encode any covering map or local isometry structure.
- theorem quotient_map_of_free_isometric_discrete_orbits_is_locally_isometric_covering ... : LocallyIsometricCoveringMap q := by sorry: States that from the assumptions (all vacuous) one can conclude the vacuous predicate holds. The map q is arbitrary X → Y; the hypotheses are parameterless True-props and a True-prop about q; the conclusion is a True-prop about q.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: For a free group action by isometries of Γ on a metric space X with discrete orbits, the quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map.

Mismatches:
- Missing structures: The code does not specify [MetricSpace X], [Group Γ], nor a group action Γ ↷ X, nor that the action is by isometries. These should be expressed using Mathlib notions (e.g., [Mul Γ], [MulAction Γ X], Isometry, Isometry.comp, etc.)
- Parameterization: The predicates FreeAction, IsometricAction, DiscreteOrbits are parameterless. They do not even depend on X, Γ, or an action, so they cannot possibly represent the intended properties.
- Quotient target: The statement concerns the canonical quotient map X → X ⧸ Γ (the orbit space). The code uses an arbitrary Y and an opaque predicate IsQuotientMapForAction q, again defined as True and not tied to Γ or an action.
- Conclusion: LocallyIsometricCoveringMap q is also vacuous and not tied to any metric topology or covering map structure.
- Use of Mathlib: No standard Mathlib structures or definitions are used to encode the metric space, group action, isometries, orbit space, quotient map, or covering maps.

Step 3: Final check: Are they the same?
No. The Lean code is not a faithful translation. All auxiliary definitions are vacuous (:= True), and worse, most are not even parameterized by the relevant data (X, Γ, the action, the map q). Even if one were to “fill in” the True definitions with real content, the current signatures are insufficient and would need to be redesigned to carry the necessary arguments (e.g., FreeAction Γ X [MulAction Γ X], IsometricAction Γ X [MetricSpace X], etc.). The theorem also allows an arbitrary Y instead of the orbit space X ⧸ Γ, relying on a vacuous predicate instead of a real quotient-map predicate. Therefore, the code does not faithfully state the mathematical claim.

Grade rationale:
- Multiple vacuous definitions (:= True) violate the guidelines.
- Predicates are not parameterized, so even replacing True with real content would require changing their types; hence, as written, the final theorem is not even structurally faithful to the intended statement.
- Therefore, the translation fails. Assign grade 3 per rubric: vacuous definitions and the final theorem would not be faithful without changing the signatures.

- variable (is_local_diffeo : P → Prop): An arbitrary predicate on points of P, intended to mean “φ is a local diffeomorphism near p,” but it is not parameterized by φ nor formally defined in terms of Mathlib’s local diffeomorphism concept. It’s just a placeholder.
- variable (is_dense : Set P → Prop): An arbitrary predicate on subsets of P, intended to mean “dense,” but with no topology on P and no tie to Mathlib’s Dense.

No connection to manifolds, smoothness, dimensions, or φ is enforced by the types.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original: φ is a smooth map between manifolds P and Q with dim P = dim Q; conclude there is a dense set of points p₀ ∈ P such that φ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of each p₀.
- Lean code: Uses completely generic placeholders: no manifold structure, no smoothness structure, no dimension; is_local_diffeo is not tied to φ nor to neighborhoods; is_dense does not refer to a topology. The statement is therefore not a faithful formalization.

Final check:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code is a shell with vacuous placeholders rather than Mathlib definitions (e.g., no [ChartedSpace], [SmoothManifoldWithCorners], ContMDiff, Dense, LocalDiffeomorph, etc.). It does not assert that is_local_diffeo relates to φ, nor that is_dense is density in any topology. This is not a legitimate, faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- Multiple vacuous placeholders are used. However, if all placeholders were replaced with proper Mathlib notions (manifold structures on P, Q; φ smooth; dim P = dim Q; is_local_diffeo meaning “φ is a local diffeomorphism near p”; is_dense meaning Dense), then the final theorem statement would match the intended natural language claim. Thus, it fits the rubric “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” corresponding to a grade around 6.

- `theorem free_group_lift_unique {S : Type _} {G : Type _} [Group G] (f : S → G) : ∃! (h : FreeGroup S →* G), h.toFun ∘ FreeGroup.of = f := by sorry`
  • For any types S and G with a group structure on G, and any function f : S → G, there exists a unique group homomorphism h : FreeGroup S →* G such that h ∘ FreeGroup.of = f. Here, `FreeGroup.of : S → FreeGroup S` is the canonical inclusion of generators, and `→*` denotes a monoid/group homomorphism. The condition `h.toFun ∘ FreeGroup.of = f` says precisely that h sends each generator s ∈ S to f(s).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL statement: Every map of sets f : S → G to a group extends uniquely to a morphism of groups ⟨S⟩ → G (the free group on S), taking each s to f(s), and “extending linearly to all words.”
- Lean theorem: Exactly the universal property: existence and uniqueness of a homomorphism h : FreeGroup S →* G such that h ∘ of = f.
- The phrase “extending linearly to all words” is informal; the universal property (existence of unique group hom extending the map on generators) captures this rigorously. The code expresses that unique extension property.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `FreeGroup`, `FreeGroup.of`, and `→*` for group homomorphisms. No placeholders or vacuous definitions.
- No extra hypotheses beyond G being a group and f a function S → G.
- The uniqueness is expressed with `∃!`.
- The only minor stylistic point is `h.toFun ∘ FreeGroup.of` instead of using coercions, but it is type-correct and faithful.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We work with types X and Y endowed with topological spaces [TopologicalSpace X] and [TopologicalSpace Y].
- We assume a function f : X → Y and a surjectivity hypothesis hf_surj : Function.Surjective f.
- We take a subset K : Set X with hK : IsCompact K.
- We assume hcover : f '' K = univ, i.e., the image of K under f is all of Y.
- We assume hf_cont : Continuous f.
- The theorem concludes CompactSpace Y, i.e., Y is compact as a topological space.

Thus, in natural language: If X and Y are topological spaces, f : X → Y is continuous and surjective, there is a compact subset K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y, then Y is compact.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original: Let f : X → Y be surjective. There exists a compact K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Equip Y with the quotient (coinduced) topology induced by f. Prove Y is compact.
- Code: Assumes Y already has some topology, and separately assumes f is continuous. It does not state Y has the coinduced (quotient) topology from f. However, the added continuity hypothesis hf_cont is precisely what is guaranteed when Y is given the coinduced topology. So the code states a more general result: for any topology on Y that makes f continuous and for which f(K) = Y with K compact, Y is compact.
- Surjectivity: The code assumes hf_surj (surjectivity), which is redundant given hcover : f '' K = univ, but the natural statement also separately assumes surjectivity and existence of K with f(K)=Y. So this mismatch is harmless.

3) Faithfulness check:
- The mathematical content used to prove compactness is: the continuous image of a compact set is compact, and if that image equals Y, then Y is compact. The quotient/coinduced topology in the original statement is invoked to guarantee continuity of f; the code instead assumes continuity explicitly. Thus, the code states a strictly stronger theorem than the original, not an equivalent one. It does not explicitly encode “equip Y with the quotient topology induced by f.”
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The only difference is the generalization and the explicit continuity hypothesis replacing the quotient-topology specification.

Conclusion: The code is very close and implies the original statement (since in the coinduced topology, hf_cont holds), but it is not a verbatim or logically equivalent translation; it is strictly stronger and does not mention the quotient topology. Under the provided harsh criteria, this counts as not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: bring in Mathlib and open the Set namespace.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are types equipped with topological space structures.
- The theorem:

  `theorem compact_of_compact_image (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (K : Set X) (hK : IsCompact K)
    (himg : f '' K = (univ : Set Y)) : IsCompact (univ : Set Y) := by sorry`
  Translation: Let f : X → Y be a continuous map between topological spaces X and Y. Suppose there exists a compact subset K of X such that the image of K under f is all of Y (i.e., f '' K = univ). Then Y is compact, i.e., the whole set Y (univ) is compact in the given topology on Y.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Natural language statement: ""Suppose f : X → Y is a surjective map from a topological space X, and suppose there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X with f(K)=Y. Prove that Y is compact in the quotient topology.""
- The code assumes hf : Continuous f, not explicit surjectivity. However, the hypothesis `f '' K = univ` implies surjectivity of f (at least onto Y via points in K). So the explicit surjectivity assumption in NL is redundant given f(K) = Y; thus that part matches in substance.
- The critical difference: the NL specifies that Y carries the quotient topology with respect to f, under which f is automatically continuous and the topology on Y is the coinduced topology from X along f. The Lean statement does not impose that Y has the quotient topology induced by f; it only assumes an arbitrary topology on Y and that f is continuous with respect to it. The conclusion is that Y is compact in that arbitrary topology. This is strictly stronger than the NL statement, because it implies compactness holds for every topology on Y making f continuous, whereas the NL only asserts compactness for the coarsest such topology (the quotient topology).

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Hypotheses on K: identical (compact K with f(K) = Y).
- Surjectivity: implicit in code via `f '' K = univ` (sufficient), so acceptable.
- Topology on Y: mismatch. NL: quotient topology induced by f. Lean: any topology on Y, with continuity assumed as an extra hypothesis. Conclusion: The code states a stronger result than the NL statement and does not explicitly tie Y’s topology to the quotient topology.

Conclusion: Although the Lean theorem would imply the NL statement (since compactness persists when passing to a coarser topology and the quotient topology is coarsest making f continuous), it is not a faithful, exact translation because it omits the constraint that Y carries the quotient topology and instead adds a general continuity hypothesis. Therefore, not faithful per the strict auditing guidelines.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language
- The file imports Mathlib and opens some namespaces. It sets up a general smooth manifold context over a nontrivially normed field 𝕜, with model spaces E, E' and topological model spaces H, H', along with model-with-corners I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H and I' : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H'. It assumes M and N are types with TopologicalSpace instances and ChartedSpace structures modeled on H and H', respectively.
- It defines unit_interval as the subtype {t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1}.
- The main theorem states: Given f : M → N with hf : Continuous f, there exists g : M → N such that g is smooth (ContMDiff I I' ⊤ g), and there exists a continuous homotopy H : M × unit_interval → N with H(x, 0) = f x and H(x, 1) = g x.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- Natural language: “Let M and N be smooth manifolds and let f ∈ C^0(M, N). Show that f is homotopic to a smooth map M → N.” This means: for smooth manifolds M and N, given a continuous map f, there exists a smooth map g and a continuous homotopy H from f to g.
- Lean theorem content-wise: Exactly asserts the existence of a smooth g and a continuous homotopy H connecting f to g (with explicit endpoint conditions). It uses ContMDiff I I' ⊤ to formalize “smooth”. The homotopy is a continuous map H : M × [0,1] → N with endpoint equalities.

Step 3: Check for mismatches or red flags
- Crucial missing assumptions: The Lean variables only assume [TopologicalSpace M], [ChartedSpace H M], [TopologicalSpace N], [ChartedSpace H' N]. They do not assume [SmoothManifoldWithCorners I M] and [SmoothManifoldWithCorners I' N], which are the standard Mathlib typeclass assumptions needed to say that M and N are smooth manifolds modeled by I and I'. The predicate ContMDiff I I' ⊤ g implicitly relies on those smooth manifold structures. If these instances are not provided, the statement is either ill-typed or, at best, not properly scoped to “smooth manifolds”. Given the prompt’s “compiling” assumption, the code might be relying on hidden instances, but as a stand-alone translation, it fails to encode “M and N are smooth manifolds”.
- The auxiliary definition unit_interval is legitimate and accurate (not a placeholder), and the homotopy endpoint conditions are correctly stated.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; the only proof is marked sorry, which is acceptable for a statement-only translation.

Final comparison: The mathematical content of the theorem matches the intended result (existence of a smooth g homotopic to f via a continuous H). However, the code omits the explicit smooth manifold assumptions ([SmoothManifoldWithCorners I M], [SmoothManifoldWithCorners I' N]). This is a material mismatch, since the original statement explicitly presumes smooth manifolds. Being extra harsh, this difference means the translation is not fully faithful, even though it is very close.

- Docstring: Restates (roughly) the natural language claim about π1 acting on the fiber of a covering map continuously.
- `def pi1_acts_on_fiber (X Y : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : X → Y) (y0 : Y) (is_covering : Prop) (Y_path_connected : Prop) (Y_locally_simply_connected : Prop) : Prop := by sorry`
  This defines a constant/function named `pi1_acts_on_fiber` that, given types X, Y with topologies, a map p : X → Y, a basepoint y0 : Y, and three bare Propositions (`is_covering`, `Y_path_connected`, `Y_locally_simply_connected`), returns a Proposition. The body is `by sorry`, i.e., completely unspecified and vacuous. There is no use of Mathlib’s definitions for covering maps, fundamental group, or group actions, no expression of the fiber p⁻¹(y0), no continuity structure, and no theorem statement.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully express the original statement?
- The original statement: For every covering space p : X → Y of a path connected and locally simply connected space Y, the fundamental group π1(Y, y0) acts on the fiber X_{y0} = p^{-1}(y0) by [x][y] = [x * y], and this action is continuous.
- The Lean code merely introduces a name `pi1_acts_on_fiber` as a Prop with no content (sorry), and with parameters that are only bare Propositions rather than Mathlib structures/instances (no `CoveringMap`, no `PathConnectedSpace`, no `LocallySimplyConnected`, no `FundamentalGroup`, no `Continuous` or `ContinuousMap`, no `Mul`/`Group` action structure). It does not state or prove anything about existence of an action, its definition, or continuity. It is not even a theorem; it’s a def returning a Prop without a definition.
- Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The code provides no theorem or claim; it defines a Prop with no content (uses `sorry`).
  - It does not use Mathlib’s notions of covering maps, fundamental groups, or group actions; instead it uses generic `Prop` placeholders.
  - It does not express the action [x][y] = [x * y] nor continuity.
  - It does not even mention the fiber p^{-1}(y0) in a formal way.
- Conclusion: The Lean code is not a legitimate or faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Grading rationale: Vacuous placeholder (`sorry`) and wrong/placeholder parameters instead of Mathlib concepts. Even if the `sorry` were replaced by something, the signature and lack of Mathlib structures indicate it would still not be a faithful translation unless substantially redesigned. Hence a low score.

Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully encode the intended concept.

3) Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The code uses a placeholder IsCovering := True, which means it does not represent the covering map property. Hence, the theorem proves a triviality (True ∧ True → True) rather than the intended topological fact.
  - No Mathlib concept of covering maps is used or approximated (e.g., evenly covered neighborhoods, local homeomorphisms, etc.).
  - The presence of sorry in the proof is not itself disqualifying for translation, but combined with the vacuous definition, the content is not captured.
- Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient space is modeled as Fin n → ℝ, representing ℝ^n. This is fine.

- Definition: polygonal_with_corners_on S x y := there exist k and a map verts : Fin (k+1) → ℝ^n with verts 0 = x and verts (Fin.last k) = y, and for every intermediate index i (i ≠ 0 and i ≠ last), verts i ∈ S.
  Natural language: there is a finite list of points from x to y whose intermediate points lie in S.
  Issues: This does not encode a polygonal path at all. It does not mention straight segments between consecutive vertices, does not state that the path consists of these segments, does not ensure segments avoid S, and does not impose any topological or geometric condition beyond membership of intermediate vertices in S. It is thus a very weak surrogate for “a polygon with corners on S”.

- Definition: shortest_path_exists S x y := ∃ γ : Icc 0 1 → ℝ^n, True.
  Natural language: there exists some function γ from [0,1] to ℝ^n and True.
  Issues: This is entirely vacuous. It does not require γ to lie in ℝ^n \ S, does not refer to length or minimality, and doesn’t even depend meaningfully on S. This is a blatant placeholder and fails to capture “the shortest path from x to y in ℝ^n − S exists”.

- Theorem: shortest_path_is_polygon (S x y) (h : shortest_path_exists S x y) : polygonal_with_corners_on S x y := by sorry.
  Natural language: assuming the (vacuous) existence of γ, conclude there exists a finite list of points from x to y whose intermediate points lie in S.
  Issues:
  1) Hypothesis is vacuous and does not express “a shortest path in ℝ^n \ S exists”.
  2) Conclusion only asserts existence of a list of points with intermediate points in S; it does not assert that the shortest path is polygonal, nor that any constructed polygonal path lies in ℝ^n \ S, nor that it coincides with the shortest path.
  3) The original statement says “the shortest path … is a polygon with corners on S,” i.e., it characterizes the shortest path itself as polygonal. The Lean statement instead says “if a ‘shortest path exists’ then there exists some polygonal-with-corners-on-S object,” which is a fundamentally different quantification and content.

Comparison to the original statement:
- The original claims: in ℝ^n \ S, the shortest path from x to y (when it exists/makes sense) is polygonal with corners on S. This involves: (a) a notion of path length and minimality, (b) the path lying in ℝ^n \ S, (c) equality/identification of the shortest path with a polygonal path whose vertices lie on S, and (d) the polygonal segments are straight line segments between vertices.
- The code:
  - Does not define or use path length or minimality (shortest).
  - Does not require the path to lie in ℝ^n \ S.
  - Does not identify the shortest path with the polygon; it only asserts the existence of some vertex sequence. No polygonal segments are even mentioned.
  - Uses a vacuous predicate shortest_path_exists and a severely weakened notion of polygonal_with_corners_on.
- Hence, the translation is not faithful. It uses vacuous/placeholder definitions and materially alters the statement (existence of some object vs characterization of the shortest path; missing the complement condition; missing polygonal edges; missing minimality).

Final check: The two math problems are different. The Lean version is far weaker and largely vacuous.

Grading rationale:
- Multiple vacuous definitions (violates guideline 3).
- Even if repaired, the theorem’s form asserts mere existence of a polygonal-with-corners-on-S object, not that the shortest path itself is polygonal, and does not enforce lying in ℝ^n \ S. So even fixing placeholders would still leave a mismatch. This warrants a low score per rubric.

  Natural language: For any topological spaces X and Y with basepoints x0 ∈ X and y0 ∈ Y, there is a group isomorphism (MulEquiv, denoted `≃*`) between the fundamental group of the product space at the product basepoint (x0, y0) and the direct product of the fundamental groups of X at x0 and Y at y0.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
The Lean statement asserts the existence (indeed, provides a specific) group isomorphism `π1(X × Y, (x0, y0)) ≃ π1(X, x0) × π1(Y, y0)`, exactly matching the natural language claim. Using `≃*` matches “isomorphic as groups.” The basepoints are correctly specified. No extra assumptions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language statement says “Prove that … is isomorphic,” which is commonly formalized as giving an explicit group isomorphism. The Lean code indeed states an explicit isomorphism. This is fully faithful (if anything, slightly stronger than mere existence but standard and acceptable).
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions are introduced. The use of `sorry` is only to omit the proof, which is allowed per instructions.
- Mathlib terms are appropriate: `FundamentalGroup` and `≃*` are standard.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Imports Mathlib and opens Function.
- Declares types X, Xtil, I with topological space structures.
- States theorem deck_transformation_preserves_lift with hypotheses:
  • p : Xtil → X, f : Xtil → Xtil
  • hf : p ∘ f = p
  • γ : I → X with hγ : Continuous γ
  • γ_tilde : I → Xtil with hγ_tilde : Continuous γ_tilde
  • h_lift : p ∘ γ_tilde = γ
  Conclusion: p ∘ (f ∘ γ_tilde) = γ.
- The proof is omitted (sorry). The statement is a purely algebraic composition equality, showing that if p ∘ f = p and p ∘ γ_tilde = γ, then p ∘ f ∘ γ_tilde = γ.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural statement: For any path connected and locally simply connected space X, a deck transformation (a homeomorphism f : Xtil ≅ Xtil with p ∘ f = p for a covering map p : Xtil → X) maps any lift of a path to a lift of the same path. Interpreting “lift of a path” in covering space theory requires continuity: a lift is a continuous map γ̃ with p ∘ γ̃ = γ.

What the Lean theorem captures:
- It assumes only p ∘ f = p and that γ̃ is continuous; it does not assume f is continuous (let alone a homeomorphism) or that p is a covering map; it does not assume X is path connected or locally simply connected; it does not identify the path domain I (e.g., [0,1]).
- The conclusion is only the equality p ∘ (f ∘ γ_tilde) = γ. It does not assert that f ∘ γ_tilde is continuous, hence it does not conclude that f ∘ γ_tilde is a lift in the standard topological sense.

Step 3: Final check: are the two statements the same?
- Missing hypotheses: deck transformation (homeomorphism), covering map, path connectedness, locally simply connectedness.
- Missing conclusion: that f ∘ γ̃ is a lift, which requires continuity of f ∘ γ̃; the code does not assume f is continuous or a homeomorphism, nor does it conclude continuity.
- The Lean theorem proves only a compositional identity, not the full statement about lifts.
- Extraneous/unused inputs: hγ, hγ_tilde are provided but not used in the conclusion; and the domain I is arbitrary rather than the unit interval, which is fine as a generalization, but the main issue is the lack of continuity of f ∘ γ̃ in the conclusion.

Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the natural statement. It proves a much weaker algebraic identity and omits core topological content (deck transformation, covering map, continuity of the lifted path) and the stated ambient hypotheses.

Grade rationale: Related to the topic but misses key definitions and the essential continuity aspect of being a lift. No vacuous placeholder definitions, but the mismatch is substantial.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- Variables: Γ is a group; X is a metric space; Γ acts on X via a MulAction (notation γ • x). There is an extra hypothesis h_isom: for every γ in Γ, the map x ↦ γ • x is an isometry (so the action is by isometries).

- The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two conditions:
  Left side (LHS): For any x, y in X, there exist open sets U, V in X such that U and V are open, x ∈ U, y ∈ V, U and V are disjoint, and U and V are Γ-invariant. Here, Γ-invariance is expressed as: for all γ and all u, u ∈ U ↔ γ • u ∈ U (and similarly for V). This is equivalent to γ • U = U for all γ.

  Right side (RHS): For any x in X, there exists ε > 0 such that for any nontrivial γ ≠ 1 and any y ∈ ball(x, ε), one has γ • y ∉ ball(x, ε). Equivalently, for all γ ≠ 1, γ • ball(x, ε) ∩ ball(x, ε) = ∅. Under the isometry assumption, this can also be seen as small balls are disjoint from all their nontrivial translates.

There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement (with proof omitted by sorry).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement says: For a group action by isometries on a metric space X, prove that the following condition is equivalent to the others: Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets.

- The code’s LHS precisely formalizes “Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets,” including openness, membership of the two given points, disjointness, and Γ-invariance. The invariance is encoded via u ∈ U ↔ γ • u ∈ U, which is equivalent to the standard γ • U = U for all γ.

- The theorem then asserts this condition is equivalent to a specific other condition (the small-disjoint-balls property under the isometric action), which reasonably stands in for “the others” in a list of equivalent conditions. The code includes the isometry assumption exactly as in the natural language setup.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Core condition: The code’s LHS matches the stated condition exactly.
- Context: The isometry assumption is present in both. The RHS is one specific “other” condition; the natural language doesn’t specify which others, but asking for an equivalence involving that condition is consistent with the phrasing.
- Minor nuances: The statement “any two points” in strict topology often means “any two distinct points,” but the provided NL statement does not explicitly say “distinct,” nor does the code; this is consistent between the two. Likewise, the NL statement does not restrict to points in different orbits; the code also does not add such a restriction. Thus, as a translation, it is faithful to the given text.

No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. Mathlib concepts used are standard and appropriate. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X, Y, Z are types with TopologicalSpace instances. So the codomain Z of continuous maps is explicit in the code, whereas the natural language statement suppresses it (usually C(Y) means C(Y, Z) for some Z like ℝ). This generalization is acceptable if the rest matches.
- def incl_snd: This defines the inclusion map C(Y, Z) → C(X × Y, Z) by precomposition with Prod.snd, i.e., g ↦ g ∘ snd. This matches the phrase “inclusion C(Y) → C(X × Y) given by precomposition with Prod.snd.”
- def incl_snd_equiv_dense (A : Set X) (hA : Dense A): This declares an equivalence between ContinuousMap Y Z and the subtype of ContinuousMap (X × Y) Z consisting of those f such that ∀ x ∈ A, ∀ y1 y2, f (x, y1) = f (x, y2). That is, f is constant on each vertical fiber {x} × Y for x ∈ A. The comment says “(and therefore for all x ∈ X)”, but that logical strengthening is not encoded in the type.
- The equivalence itself is left as by sorry, i.e. a placeholder.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “Suppose X and Y are topological spaces and A ⊆ X is dense. Prove that the inclusion of C(Y) → C(X × Y) is an isomorphism onto the functions which are constant on each set {x} × Y with x ∈ X.”
- The code targets the subtype of functions constant on {x} × Y only for x ∈ A, not for all x ∈ X. The parenthetical comment claims density upgrades this to all x, but the formal statement does not express that. This is a mismatch: the NL statement specifies constancy for every x ∈ X.
- Moreover, the declared equivalence is provided with sorry; per the auditing guidelines, an auxiliary definition filled with sorry causes the translation to fail.
- Additional conceptual red flag: The inclusion via Prod.snd maps g : Y → Z to h(x, y) = g(y), which is constant along X × {y} (horizontal fibers), not along {x} × Y (vertical fibers). The code’s property and the NL statement both describe constancy on {x} × Y, which does not match the actual image of precomposition by Prod.snd. While this is a mathematical inconsistency in both the statement and the code, our task is to check whether the code faithfully translates the given NL statement. In any case, the mismatch between “x ∈ A” versus “x ∈ X” and the use of sorry are sufficient to fail the translation.

Final verdict:
- The code does not faithfully translate the NL statement: it formalizes constancy only on A, not on all of X, and the main equivalence is a sorry placeholder.
- Therefore, the translation fails.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- universe u v w: Universe parameters.
- constant universal_covering_map ... : (X → Y) → Prop: Introduces an uninterpreted predicate symbol saying “p : X → Y is a universal covering map.” This is a placeholder, not a Mathlib definition, and has no axioms/structure attached.
- theorem universal_covers_unique_map ... (p : X → Y) (q : Z → Y) (hp : universal_covering_map p) (hq : universal_covering_map q) : ∃! (f : X → Z), q ∘ f = p := by sorry: States that if p and q are (by the placeholder predicate) universal covering maps, then there exists a unique function f : X → Z such that q ∘ f = p. No continuity is required for f; it is simply a function. The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Does this match the natural language statement?
- The NL statement: “Suppose that X → Y and Z → Y are universal covering maps. Prove that X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y, i.e. there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle commute.”
- Issues:
  1) Placeholder predicate: The code invents universal_covering_map as a bare constant. It does not use Mathlib’s notions of covering maps or universal covers, nor does it define the concept at all. This is a red flag per the guidelines; the auxiliary definition is a vacuous placeholder and not faithful.
  2) Continuity missing: In topology, “map” means continuous map. The code quantifies over all functions f : X → Z with no continuity requirement. This is a significant mismatch: uniqueness among all set-theoretic functions is much stronger (and typically false), whereas the intended statement concerns uniqueness among continuous maps (covering morphisms).
  3) Isomorphism vs unique map: The NL statement frames isomorphism of coverings and then says “i.e., there is a unique map X → Z commuting.” Even taking that “i.e.” at face value, the code only asserts existence and uniqueness of a function in Set, not a covering isomorphism (homeomorphism over Y), nor even a continuous map. It also doesn’t state the dual unique map Z → X, from which isomorphism would follow. So it fails to capture “isomorphic as coverings.”

Step 3: Final comparison
- The code’s core claim is: between two universal covering maps p and q, there is a unique function f with q ∘ f = p. This omits continuity and any isomorphism structure, and it uses a vacuous placeholder predicate for “universal covering map.” Therefore, it is not a faithful formalization of the NL statement and uses illegitimate auxiliary definitions per the auditing guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

- Definition: `homotopy_rel {X} [TopologicalSpace X] {x : X} (p q : Path x x) (S : Set X) : Prop := True`.
  Natural language: This defines a predicate that is supposed to mean “p is homotopic to q relative to S”, but it is defined to be always true (a vacuous placeholder). Moreover, the set `S` is a subset of `X`, not a subset of the parameter interval [0,1]; so it does not match the usual notion of homotopy relative to {0,1}.
- Theorem: `loop_concat_reverse_contractible {X} [TopologicalSpace X] {x0 : X} (p : Path x0 x0) : homotopy_rel (Path.trans p (Path.refl x0)) (Path.refl x0) (Set.singleton x0) := by sorry`.
  Natural language: For any loop `p` at `x0`, the concatenation of `p` with the constant loop at `x0` is homotopic (according to the placeholder `homotopy_rel`) to the constant loop at `x0`, relative to the subset `{x0} ⊆ X`. The proof is omitted.

Key mismatches and issues:
1) Vacuous placeholder: `homotopy_rel := True` invalidates the intended notion entirely. This is a major red flag per the guidelines.
2) Wrong relative set: The code uses `Set X` and specifically `Set.singleton x0 ⊆ X` as the relative set, whereas the statement requires homotopy relative to `{0,1} ⊆ [0,1]` (the domain). In Mathlib, path homotopy typically fixes the endpoints (i.e., relative to {0,1} in the domain), not a subset of X.
3) Wrong path on the left: The theorem claims something about `Path.trans p (Path.refl x0)` (p concatenated with the constant loop), while the statement concerns `p * p.reverse` (a path followed by its reverse). These are not the same.
4) Scope mismatch: The original statement starts with an arbitrary path x : [0,1] → X and then forms a loop x * x̄ at x(0). The Lean statement quantifies over loops `p : Path x0 x0`. This rephrasing could be acceptable if done correctly, but combined with (2) and (3) it deviates significantly.
5) Use of Mathlib concepts: Mathlib already has `Path.symm` (reverse), `Path.trans` (concatenation), and `Path.Homotopic` (homotopy with endpoints fixed). The code does not use these properly and introduces a nonstandard placeholder instead.
Final check: The two problems are not the same. The Lean statement is both vacuous (due to `True`) and asserts a different homotopy (p * id instead of p * p.reverse) relative to a different set ({x0} ⊆ X instead of {0,1} ⊆ [0,1]). Hence the translation fails.

- `def covering_sheets_const_on_path_connected ... (hpath : ∀ y0 y1 : Y, ∃ (I' : Type w) (γ' : I' → Y) (t0 t1 : I'), γ' t0 = y0 ∧ γ' t1 = y1) ... : (fiber (f := f) y0) ≃ (fiber (f := f) y1) := by sorry`
  This claims: if for any y0,y1 in Y there exist some type I', a function γ' : I' → Y, and points t0,t1 with γ' t0 = y0 and γ' t1 = y1, then the fibers over y0 and y1 are bijective. The hypothesis `hpath` is not path connectedness; it is trivially true for any Y by taking I' = Bool and γ' sending false to y0 and true to y1. So this turns into: for any function f and any y0,y1, there is a bijection between fibers—again wildly false in general and not a faithful rendering of the original. Also no topology, no evenly covered sets, no sheet counts, and it’s a `def` with `sorry`.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement is about covering maps in topological spaces, evenly covered open sets, and the number of sheets (possibly ∞). It asserts constancy of the number of sheets along a path in Y, and deduces global constancy if Y is path connected (n-to-1 covering).
- The code:
  - Uses a vacuous `is_covering_map := True` instead of a real covering map notion.
  - Has no topological structure on X or Y, no notion of open sets, no evenly covered sets, and no definition of “number of sheets” (e.g., via components of the preimage over an evenly covered open set or fiber cardinality).
  - Replaces “path” with an arbitrary function from an arbitrary type with no continuity or interval structure.
  - Replaces “path connectedness” with a trivial reachability condition that every pair is hit by some function at two indices (always true), hence not path connectedness.
  - States equivalence of fibers as the main object instead of framing sheet counts; while in true covering theory fiber equivalence along paths is a valid stronger statement that implies constant fiber cardinalities, the present code neither connects to nor defines “number of sheets” or “evenly covered open set”.
  - Uses `sorry` and defines these as `def`s, not theorems; per the auditing guidelines, vacuous placeholder definitions and omitted proofs are red flags unless the statements are themselves faithful, which they are not.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code is missing essential concepts (topology, evenly covered open sets, sheet counts), replaces key hypotheses with vacuous ones (`True`, trivial “paths”), and asserts a much stronger and generally false fiber equivalence statement for arbitrary functions. Even if the placeholders were replaced by real definitions, the first claim about sheets above evenly covered open sets is not addressed, and the path notion and path connectedness are still incorrectly modeled. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: Multiple severe mismatches (vacuous predicates, missing core notions, wrong path/path-connectedness modeling), and even with fixes the statements as written do not directly state the NL result about sheet counts and evenly covered sets. This fits the rubric “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.”

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem `invertible_matrix_with_pos_and_neg_eigen_is_covering_map {n : ℕ}` sets up a statement for an arbitrary dimension n.
- `(A : (Fin n → ℝ) ≃ₗ[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ))`: A is a linear equivalence (an invertible linear map) on ℝ^n, represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`.
- `(lam mu : ℝ) (v w : Fin n → ℝ)`: Two real numbers lam and mu, and two vectors v, w in ℝ^n.
- `(hv : v ≠ 0) (hw : w ≠ 0)`: v and w are nonzero.
- `(hA_v : (A.toLinearMap : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)) v = lam • v)`: v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue lam.
- `(hA_w : (A.toLinearMap : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)) w = mu • w)`: w is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue mu.
- `(hlam : lam > 1) (hmu : mu < -1)`: The eigenvalues satisfy lam > 1 and mu < -1.
- Conclusion: `IsCoveringMap (A.toLinearMap : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ))`: The underlying linear map is a covering map.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; this does not affect the statement's translation.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Take an invertible matrix A on ℝ^n with at least one eigenvalue λ > 1 and at least one eigenvalue λ < −1. Prove A: ℝ^n → ℝ^n is a covering map.

Lean statement: Assumes A is an invertible linear map on ℝ^n; assumes existence of two eigenvalues lam > 1 and mu < −1 via explicit witnesses (nonzero eigenvectors v and w) and concludes the underlying map is a covering map. This matches the natural language exactly: providing explicit eigenvectors is simply the constructive way to encode “there exists an eigenvalue.” The domain ℝ^n is represented as `(Fin n → ℝ)`, which is standard in Mathlib. The conclusion is precisely that the function `(A.toLinearMap)` is a covering map, i.e., A is a covering map between the standard topological spaces.

Step 3: Check for differences or red flags
- Strength of hypotheses: The Lean code requires explicit eigenvectors, which is equivalent to the existential statement in the natural language. No mismatch.
- Object representation: Uses linear equivalence instead of a matrix; this is the canonical Mathlib way to represent an invertible matrix acting on ℝ^n. No mismatch in meaning.
- Target predicate: `IsCoveringMap` is the right notion for covering maps in Mathlib; no placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced. No auxiliary definitions at all.
- Topological context is implicit but standard for `(Fin n → ℝ)`. The conclusion matches “A is a covering map.”

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `universe u` and `variable {Y : Type u} [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We fix a type Y with a topology.
- `constant BasedCovering : ∀ (X : Type u) (x0 : X), Prop`: A placeholder predicate saying “(X, x0) is a based covering.” Critically, it does not mention Y or a map to Y. In the natural language statement, a covering is a map (X, x0) → (Y, y0). This definition omits Y entirely and thus does not encode coverings over Y.
- `constant UniversalCover : ∀ (X : Type u) (x0 : X), Prop`: A placeholder predicate saying “(X, x0) is a universal cover.” Again, it does not reference Y or a covering map to Y. In the natural language statement, universality is relative to Y.
- `constant CoveringMorphism : ∀ (X : Type u) (x0 : X) (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z), Type u`: A placeholder type of morphisms between based coverings. It does not reference Y, and does not ensure morphisms are over Y (i.e., commute with the projections to Y) nor respect basepoints in any structured way beyond the type indices.
- `constant Y_is_Hausdorff : Prop` and `constant Y_has_universal_covering : Prop`: Abstract props, not tied to the actual Y or its topology (they should reflect something like `[T2Space Y]` and the existence of a universal cover of Y as a topological space). They are not connected to Y's actual structure.
- The theorem `universal_covering_iff_lifting_property (hY : Y_is_Hausdorff) (hYuniv : Y_has_universal_covering) : ∀ {X : Type u} (x0 : X), BasedCovering X x0 → (UniversalCover X x0 ↔ ∀ {Z : Type u} (z0 : Z), BasedCovering Z z0 → ∃! (f : CoveringMorphism X x0 Z z0), True) := ...`
  • Interpreted: Under the assumptions that Y_is_Hausdorff and Y_has_universal_covering (both opaque and not linked to Y), for any based covering (X, x0) (again not over Y), universality of (X, x0) is equivalent to: for every based covering (Z, z0) (again not over Y), there exists a unique morphism f : CoveringMorphism X x0 Z z0 such that True.
  • The unique existence clause `∃! (f : CoveringMorphism ...), True` means “the type CoveringMorphism X x0 Z z0 has exactly one element,” which is not the standard categorical or topological uniqueness condition (which should be uniqueness of a map over Y respecting basepoints, i.e., commuting with covering projections). Also the property `True` provides no condition.
  • The proof ends with `sorry`, which is a placeholder. Even if accepted by Lean, per the audit it indicates the statement is posed but not proven. Our task is about translation fidelity, not proof completion, but the use of sorry indicates no attempt to ground these placeholders.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: Let Y be Hausdorff and admit a universal covering space. Then a based covering map (X, x0) → (Y, y0) is universal iff every based covering map (Z, z0) → (Y, y0) has a unique morphism (X, x0) → (Z, z0) (over Y, preserving basepoints).

Mismatches:
- Missing Y and y0 in all covering structures: The code’s `BasedCovering X x0` and `UniversalCover X x0` do not include a map to Y or the basepoint y0. The original statement is explicitly about coverings over Y with specified basepoints.
- Missing the structure of a morphism over Y: `CoveringMorphism X x0 Z z0` is an arbitrary type; it does not encode maps commuting with the covering maps to Y, nor basepoint conditions.
- Trivial uniqueness condition: `∃! (f : ...), True` asserts a unique element exists irrespective of any commutativity condition. The original statement requires uniqueness of a morphism of coverings over Y.
- Hausdorffness and existence of a universal cover aren’t tied to Y: `Y_is_Hausdorff` and `Y_has_universal_covering` are standalone props; they do not assert anything about the actual `Y` with its topology. Properly, one would express Hausdorffness as `[T2Space Y]` or `T1Space Y` depending on convention, and the existence of a universal cover as a statement about Y.
- No Mathlib concepts used: The code uses none of Mathlib’s covering space notions or topological morphisms. All core notions are opaque constants, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Step 3: Final check – are the problems the same?
No. The Lean code is a highly vacuous schema. It does not specify that X and Z cover Y, does not carry a basepoint y0 in Y, and the notion of morphism and uniqueness are completely unlinked to the categorical/topological structure required. The uniqueness quantifies over a type with no property other than existing, making it meaningless. Therefore the code is not a faithful translation of the given statement.

Auxiliary definitions legitimacy:
- All key notions (BasedCovering, UniversalCover, CoveringMorphism) are vacuous placeholders and do not faithfully define what they purport to. This fails the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be faithful and nonvacuous.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Suggested grade: 3 (vacuous placeholders and the theorem’s statement, even aside from placeholders, omits essential dependence on Y and y0 and uses a trivial uniqueness predicate).

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Topology`: bring in Mathlib and topology notations.
- The theorem `paths_concat_defined_iff` is stated for a topological space `X` and three continuous maps `x y z : C(↑unitInterval, X)` (continuous maps from the unit interval to `X`).
- Its statement is: `((x.toFun 1 = y.toFun 0) ∧ (y.toFun 1 = z.toFun 0)) ↔ ((x.toFun 1 = y.toFun 0) ∧ (y.toFun 1 = z.toFun 0))`.
  That is, it asserts an equivalence between a conjunction and itself, i.e., a tautology. There is no mention of concatenation of paths, nor of homotopy, nor of “definedness” of concatenation in the formal statement. The proof is `sorry` (incomplete), but per instructions we only audit the statement.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL statement: Given paths x, y, z whose concatenations are defined, prove two things:
  1) Associativity up to homotopy relative to endpoints: `(x*y)*z` is homotopic rel `{0,1}` to `x*(y*z)`.
  2) Definedness equivalence: `(x*y)*z` is defined iff `x*(y*z)` is defined.
- The Lean theorem does not refer to concatenation `*` at all, nor to homotopies, nor to the relative condition `{0,1}`. It only states the equivalence of the endpoint equalities `(x(1) = y(0)) ∧ (y(1) = z(0))` with itself. While these equalities are the necessary and sufficient conditions for both concatenations to be defined, the theorem in code does not actually relate these equalities to definedness or concatenation; it's just a tautology. Moreover, it completely omits the primary part of the statement: homotopy associativity relative to `{0,1}`.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code does not formalize concatenation, definedness, or homotopy relative to `{0,1}`. It only states a trivial equivalence of the same condition with itself. Therefore, it fails to translate the original statement.

Additional notes:
- The code does not use Mathlib's `Path X x0 x1` structure or its concatenation and homotopy machinery, which would be the appropriate setting. Using `C(↑unitInterval, X)` might be acceptable if one encoded concatenation and homotopy explicitly, but none of that is present here.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: Γ, X, Y are types; Γ is a group with a topology (TopologicalSpace Γ), X and Y are topological spaces; Γ acts on X (MulAction Γ X).
- The theorem `exists_point_with_compact_stabilizer_and_compact_transversal` is stated under the following hypotheses:
  - q : X → Y is a function.
  - hq_cont : q is continuous.
  - hq_surj : q is surjective.
  - hq_iff : For all x y in X, q x = q y if and only if there exists g : Γ with g • x = y (i.e., the fibers of q are precisely Γ-orbits).
  - hY_comp : Y is compact (i.e., IsCompact (univ : Set Y)).
- Conclusion is a conjunction of two statements:
  (a) For every x0 : X, there exists x : X in the orbit of x0 (∃ g, x = g • x0) such that the stabilizer set {γ : Γ | γ • x = x} is compact in Γ.
  (b) There exists a compact set K ⊆ X such that K meets every orbit (i.e. ∀ x0, ∃ y ∈ K and ∃ g : Γ, g • x0 = y).
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing as long as the statement itself is correct.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If a group Γ acts on a topological space X and the quotient space X/Γ (with the quotient topology) is compact, then (i) every orbit contains a point with compact stabilizer and (ii) there exists a compact subset of X meeting every Γ-orbit.
- Code assumptions reformulate the compactness of the orbit space by introducing an explicit space Y and a map q : X → Y that identifies points exactly when they lie in the same orbit, requiring q to be continuous and surjective, and Y to be compact.
- Conclusions (i) and (ii) match the natural language statement exactly in content.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Key difference: The natural language assumes that X/Γ with the quotient topology is compact. The code assumes the existence of a compact space Y and a continuous surjection q whose fibers are precisely the orbits, but does not assert that Y carries the quotient topology (i.e., q being a quotient map or Y being homeomorphic to X/Γ with its quotient topology). In particular, the code does not require that the topology on Y is the quotient topology; it could be strictly coarser. Thus the code’s hypothesis is strictly weaker than “X/Γ is compact.”
- Implication direction: If X/Γ (with the quotient topology) is compact, then taking Y = X/Γ and q the canonical quotient map satisfies the code’s assumptions. Hence the natural language assumption implies the Lean assumptions, and the conclusions coincide. However, the reverse implication need not hold: there could be a compact Y with a continuous surjection identifying orbits even when the actual quotient space X/Γ is not compact (because Y might have a coarser topology). Therefore, the Lean statement is not logically equivalent to the original; it is stronger (it assumes less to conclude the same result).
- Other details: The code correctly requires a topology on Γ to make sense of “compact stabilizer,” which is implicitly needed by the natural language. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The stabilizer is expressed as a subset {γ | γ • x = x}, and compactness is applied to that set. The second assertion correctly formalizes the existence of a compact subset meeting every orbit.

Conclusion: While the conclusions are exactly those in the natural language statement, the hypothesis deviates by not asserting that Y has the quotient topology; thus the formalization is close but not a strictly faithful translation of “X/Γ is compact.”

3) Differences and issues:
- Family vs single map: The Lean statement handles the final topology from a single map P : X → Y via `coinduced P tX`. The NL statement is about a family (f_i) and the existence of a single P aggregating all of them. The code does not mention a family nor any universal property about “including all f_i”.
- Criterion mismatch: The Lean equivalence is between Y being Hausdorff and the closedness of the relation R = {(x, x') | P x = P x'}. The NL statement asserts Hausdorffness is equivalent to injectivity of some aggregating map P. Closedness of the relation is much weaker than injectivity, and these conditions are not equivalent in general.
- Existential quantifier: The NL statement has an existential quantification over X and P that include the family; the code quantifies over an arbitrary given X and P, with no “includes all f_i” condition.
- Thus, the mathematical content is not the same: the code gives a (generally false without extra hypotheses) closed-relation characterization for a single final/coinduced topology, whereas the NL statement claims an injectivity characterization for a family-induced final topology.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code sets up topological spaces X, Y with basepoints x0, y0 and maps f0, f1 : X → Y.
- It introduces an abstract predicate `Homotopic : (X → Y) → (X → Y) → Prop` to express that two maps are homotopic. This is not Mathlib’s notion of homotopy, nor does it encode continuity or basepoint conditions.
- It introduces an abstract function `map_on_pi1 : (X → Y) → FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup Y y0` intended to represent the induced map on fundamental groups. This is not Mathlib’s induced homomorphism; it is just an arbitrary function, and its definition is not tied to continuity, homotopy, or basepoints.
- The theorem `homotopy_induces_same_map_on_fundamental_group` states: if `Homotopic f0 f1` and f0 x0 = y0 and f1 x0 = y0, then `map_on_pi1 f0 = map_on_pi1 f1`. The proof is omitted (`sorry`). There is no relation stipulated between `Homotopic` and `map_on_pi1`, and neither object is defined or constrained by Mathlib.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Given a homotopy f_t : X → Y of continuous maps with f0(x0) = f1(x0) = y0, show that the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups agree: (f0)_* = (f1)_*: π1(X,x0) → π1(Y,y0).
- Issues:
  - The code uses an arbitrary predicate `Homotopic` rather than Mathlib’s `ContinuousMap` and `Homotopy` (or `ContinuousMap.homotopic`). It does not encode continuity or the structure of a homotopy.
  - The code uses an arbitrary `map_on_pi1` instead of Mathlib’s induced map on fundamental groups. It does not assert that this is a group homomorphism (the NL statement explicitly says “induced homomorphisms”).
  - There is no guarantee that the homotopy preserves the basepoint across t; the NL statement is ambiguous here, but the standard correct theorem needs a basepoint-preserving homotopy for equality (otherwise one only gets conjugacy by the path t ↦ f_t(x0)). The code does not encode the basepoint-preserving aspect of the homotopy—only the endpoint conditions f0 x0 = y0 and f1 x0 = y0 are assumptions, and these are not tied to the definition of `map_on_pi1` or to the `Homotopic` predicate.
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s available structures for π₁ or the induced map (e.g. `FundamentalGroup`’s `map` along a continuous basepoint-preserving map as a homomorphism). It also asserts an equality of arbitrary functions rather than of group homomorphisms.
  - The theorem is presented with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions, but the underlying objects are vacuous/abstract placeholders without any constraints linking them to the intended mathematical notions.

Final check:
- The code is not a faithful translation. It replaces core mathematical content (homotopy, continuity, induced homomorphism on π₁) with unconstrained placeholders/variables. It also misses the crucial condition about basepoint preservation along the homotopy that is typically needed for the conclusion. Even if one swapped in Mathlib’s true `Homotopy` without further constraints, the statement would still be too strong without asserting basepoint preservation, and the use of an arbitrary `map_on_pi1` remains a major mismatch.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous/abstract placeholders for critical concepts and missing ties to Mathlib definitions → not faithful.
- Even if placeholders were replaced by some definitions, the lack of basepoint-preserving condition and the incorrect type for the induced homomorphism would still render the statement unfaithful unless further repaired.
- Therefore, a low score is warranted.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Load the Mathlib library.
- Comment block: States the intended mathematical content: given a path p : Path x0 x1, the map on fundamental groups induced by conjugation sends [y] to [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)] and yields a group isomorphism FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* FundamentalGroup X x1.
- `variable (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X]`: Let X be a topological space.
- `def fundamental_group_conj {x0 x1 : X} (p : Path x0 x1) : FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* FundamentalGroup X x1 := by sorry`: Declares (as a definition) an isomorphism between the fundamental groups at x0 and x1, depending on a path p from x0 to x1. However, it provides no construction; the body is `sorry`.

Step 2: Assess whether the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: For a path x from x0 to x1, the assignment [y] ↦ [\bar x*(y*x)] induces a group isomorphism π1(X,x0) → π1(X,x1).
- The Lean code’s type matches the existence of a group isomorphism between π1(X,x0) and π1(X,x1) depending on a path p. The docstring states the intended map is [y] ↦ [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)], which corresponds to \bar x*(y*x).
- However, formally, the code does not specify that the isomorphism is induced by that assignment; this is only in a comment. The definition itself is a placeholder with `sorry`. Thus, the crucial part—defining the map via conjugation and proving it is a group isomorphism—is not present in the formal content. Per the guidelines, a `sorry` in a definition is a vacuous placeholder.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Mathematical intent: Same (conjugation by a path induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups at the endpoints).
- Formal Lean statement: Merely asserts the existence of an isomorphism (as a def) but provides no construction and no guarantee it is the conjugation by p; that is only stated in comments. Additionally, the use of `sorry` makes the definition vacuous.
- Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the statement according to the strict auditing criteria.

Other observations:
- No auxiliary placeholder definitions besides the final `def`, but that `def` itself is vacuous.
- The Mathlib names used (Path, FundamentalGroup, trans, symm, ≃*) are appropriate and modern, but this does not overcome the use of `sorry`.

Conclusion: Not faithful under the guidelines due to the vacuous `def` and lack of formal specification of the mapping.

This matches the statement “k = ℝ or k = ℂ, up to isomorphism” under the interpretation “contains ℝ” as having an ℝ-algebra structure.

- Theorem finite_dim_field_extension_is_R_or_C: This is essentially a duplicate of the first theorem, restating the same conclusion under the same hypotheses. The comment claims it implies the splitting-field corollary, but the theorem statement itself does not formalize that consequence.

- Theorem complex_is_algebraically_closed: States IsAlgClosed ℂ, i.e., ℂ is algebraically closed. This implies that every complex polynomial splits into linear factors over ℂ.

No auxiliary definitions are introduced; no vacuous placeholders beyond sorry-proofs are used. The statements use standard Mathlib notions: Field, Algebra, FiniteDimensional, AlgEquiv, IsAlgClosed.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The primary classification claim “Suppose k is a field containing ℝ and finite-dimensional over ℝ; then k ≅ ℝ or k ≅ ℂ (as ℝ-algebras)” is faithfully captured by the first theorem.
- The final “every complex polynomial splits into linear factors over ℂ” is captured by the theorem complex_is_algebraically_closed.
- Missing: The code does not formalize the “in particular” part that “the splitting field of any real or complex polynomial in one variable has degree at most 2 over ℝ.” This consequence is not stated as a theorem; it appears only as a comment in the second theorem. Comments are not formal content.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Match: The classification of finite-dimensional ℝ-field extensions as ℝ or ℂ (up to ℝ-algebra isomorphism).
- Match: The fact that complex polynomials split (via IsAlgClosed ℂ).
- Missing: No formal statement about splitting fields over ℝ having degree ≤ 2 for real or complex polynomials. This is a substantive part of the original “in particular” and is not translated.

Conclusion: While the main theorem and one of the corollaries are present, the important corollary about splitting field degrees is absent. Thus the translation is not fully faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Complex Set TopologicalSpace: set up the environment.
- def has_log {U : Set ℂ} (g : Subtype U → ℂ) : Prop := ∃ G : Subtype U → ℂ, ∀ z, g z = Complex.exp (G z): defines that g has a logarithm on U if there exists a function G on U with g = exp ∘ G. Note: this definition does not require analyticity of G.
- def maps_loops_to_nullhomotopic (U : Set ℂ) (g : Subtype U → ℂ) : Prop := True: placeholder predicate claiming that g maps every loop in U to a null-homotopic loop in ℂ \ {0}; but it is defined as True, i.e., vacuous.

No analyticity assumptions on g or G are present; the loop condition is the vacuous predicate above. Proof omitted (sorry), but we only judge the statement and definitions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: U (Z) is a domain (open and connected) in ℂ, g: U → ℂ is complex analytic. A logarithm for g is a complex analytic G with g = e^G. Then g has a logarithm iff (1) g ≠ 0 on U and (2) g sends every loop in U to a null-homotopic loop in ℂ \ {0}.
- Mismatches:
  - Analyticity: The code does not require g to be analytic anywhere. The predicate has_log does not require G to be analytic either; it only asks for a function G with exp G = g. This is a major omission.
  - Loop condition: maps_loops_to_nullhomotopic is defined as True, a vacuous placeholder, not the actual topological condition. This is explicitly a red flag per the guidelines.
  - Domain hypothesis: The code includes IsOpen U and IsConnected U hypotheses, which aligns with ""domain"". That part is fine.
  - Target space for the loop condition: The intended statement references loops in ℂ \ {0}. The code's placeholder does not encode this at all.

3) Final comparison and verdict:
- The Lean code does not faithfully translate the natural language theorem. Key mathematical content (analyticity of g and G, and the actual loop-to-null-homotopic condition) is missing or replaced by a vacuous predicate. Therefore, the translation fails.
- If the vacuous predicate were replaced by a correct formulation and analyticity were added to both g and has_log (requiring holomorphic G), then the statement could be faithful; but as written, it is not.

Grade rationale: Multiple vacuous/omitted definitions (maps_loops_to_nullhomotopic := True; missing analyticity in has_log and theorem hypotheses) mean the translation is not faithful. However, the overall structure (U open/connected, nowhere-zero condition, an iff statement) loosely mirrors the intended theorem, so this is not completely unrelated. This fits a grade where vacuous defs exist but could be fixed to achieve faithfulness.

None of these depend on the actual data (p, act, Γ, Y, X), so the statement is vacuous.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language: If Γ acts on Y by a covering action, Y is simply connected, locally simply connected, and Hausdorff, then the quotient map p : Y → X = Γ\Y is a universal covering map, and there is a group isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ.

Required ingredients in a faithful Lean statement:
- A precise notion of a covering action of Γ on Y (depending on Γ, Y, and the action), and that X is the quotient Γ\Y with p the quotient map.
- Y must satisfy SimplyConnected Y, LocallySimplyConnected Y, and Hausdorff (T2Space Y), all depending on Y’s topology.
- Conclusion: p is a universal covering map (a property of p : Y → X), not a bare Prop.
- Fundamental group: a basepoint x0 : X is provided; the conclusion should be an isomorphism fundamental_group X x0 ≅ Γ (or the Mathlib version FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* Γ), specifying exactly which groups are isomorphic.

The provided code fails on all these counts:
- All auxiliary predicates are vacuous (bare Prop) and do not depend on the relevant data. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and faithful.
- The quotient description X = Γ\Y and that p is the quotient map is not encoded at all.
- The action act is present but never used in the hypotheses (since CoveringAction has no parameters) or the conclusion.
- The conclusion IsUniversalCoveringMap is a bare Prop and does not assert that p is a universal covering map.
- The conclusion GroupIso does not assert an isomorphism π1(X, x0) ≅ Γ, nor does it even reference any groups.
- Although a basepoint x0 : X is introduced, it is not used, and fundamental_group is never referenced in the theorem.
- The code does not use Mathlib’s standard notions (e.g., SimplyConnected Y, T2Space Y, Quotient, covering maps, FundamentalGroup X x0), which is a strong red flag per the guidelines.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean statement is a vacuous conjunction of two unspecified propositions, disconnected from the given data, whereas the original statement is a precise theorem about quotient maps of covering group actions yielding universal covers and identifying the fundamental group with Γ. The Lean code neither specifies the quotient map nor the isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ, and its auxiliary predicates lack the necessary dependencies.

Given the rubric: the code uses vacuous definitions, and even if those were merely “fixed” as-is without changing the theorem statement, the conclusion still wouldn’t refer to p or π1(X) ≅ Γ. Thus it falls under the case: makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.

- `variable {Γ : Type*} [Group Γ] [MulAction Γ X]`: A group Γ acting on X.
- `def orbit_rel (x y : X) : Prop := ∃ g : Γ, g • x = y`: Defines the orbit relation as reachability by the group action. Note: this is just a binary relation, not packaged as a Setoid (equivalence relation), and it is not used later.
- The theorem:
  `theorem quotient_metric_topology_agrees (hIsometry : ∀ g x y, dist (g • x) (g • y) = dist x y) : ∃ (R : Setoid X) (inst : MetricSpace (Quotient R)), True := by sorry`
  Natural language: Assuming the action is by isometries (each group element preserves distances), there exists some equivalence relation R on X and some metric space structure on the quotient type Quotient R, and (trivially) True. The statement does not identify R as the orbit relation; it does not define or mention the quotient metric d(\bar x, \bar y) = inf_{g∈Γ} d(gx,y); it does not assert that the metric topology agrees with the quotient topology; it does not even say the quotient is taken by the group action. The final `True` is vacuous filler.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
The NL statement: For an action by isometries, the condition “the quotient space is a metric space under the quotient metric d(\bar x, \bar y) = inf_{g∈Γ} d(gx,y), and the metric topology agrees with the quotient topology” is equivalent to the other conditions (we only need the part asserting this condition). So the formalization should:
- Take the quotient by the orbit equivalence relation induced by Γ acting on X.
- Define the metric on the quotient via d̄(\bar x, \bar y) = inf_{g∈Γ} d(gx, y).
- Assert that this is a metric and that its topology equals the quotient topology.
- Optionally mention equivalence with other conditions (but at least state the above condition precisely).

The provided Lean theorem does none of these precisely: it existentially quantifies an arbitrary Setoid R (not tied to the action), does not define or reference the infimum metric, and only asserts existence of some MetricSpace structure on Quotient R, with no topological agreement claim. The included `orbit_rel` is not used and is not packaged as a Setoid. The final `True` is vacuous.

Step 3: Final check.
- Target: Quotient by Γ-orbits with the specific infimum metric inducing the quotient topology.
- Code: There exists some (unspecified) equivalence relation and some metric structure on its quotient; no mention of the infimum metric or topology agreement; not even guaranteed to be the orbit quotient.
These are different statements. The code is far weaker and essentially unrelated to the required specific construction.

Additional red flags:
- The theorem returns `... , True`, which is vacuous.
- The constructed relation is not required to be the orbit equivalence.
- The quotient metric formula is not mentioned.
- No topological comparison is stated.
- Use of `sorry` is acceptable for omitted proofs, but the statement itself must be faithful; it is not.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation.

",1,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context and variables:
  - X : Type u with [TopologicalSpace X], x0 : X. This sets a topological space X with a chosen basepoint x0.
  - Γ : Type v with [Group Γ]. A group Γ.
  - φ : FundamentalGroup X x0 →* Γ. A group homomorphism from π1(X, x0) to Γ.
  - Xφ : Type* with [TopologicalSpace Xφ], pφ : Xφ → X. A space Xφ with a continuous map pφ to X (continuity is not specified here, just a function and a topology).
  - [MulAction Γ Xφ]. Γ acts on Xφ.
  - path_conn : PathConnectedSpace X. X is path connected.
  - locally_simply_connected : Prop. An arbitrary proposition; not tied to any Mathlib notion and not used anywhere.

- Theorem covering_space_from_group_morphism:
  Statement: ∃ (Y : Type*) (htop : TopologicalSpace Y) (p : Y → X) (act : MulAction Γ Y), Continuous p.
  Natural language: There exists some type Y with a topology, a map p : Y → X, an action of Γ on Y, and p is continuous.
  Issues:
  - This does not use φ, does not use Xφ or pφ, and does not assume or conclude any covering space property. No mention of Γ-covering, no relation to π1(X), and no use of path connectedness or local simple connectedness. It is an extremely weak existence statement that is true in many trivial situations and is unrelated to the construction or classification of coverings.

- Theorem classification_of_connected_Gamma_coverings:
  Statement: For any Y with [TopologicalSpace Y], p : Y → X, [MulAction Γ Y], with hcont : Continuous p and hconnY : ConnectedSpace Y, there exists (ψ : FundamentalGroup X x0 →* Γ), True.
  Natural language: Given any connected topological space Y with a Γ action and a continuous map p : Y → X, there exists a group homomorphism ψ : π1(X, x0) → Γ, and True.
  Issues:
  - The conclusion is only “∃ ψ, True”, which collapses to “∃ ψ” and is trivial because the trivial homomorphism always exists; no relation to Y, p, or covering properties is asserted.
  - No mention of covering maps or Γ-coverings.
  - No indication that Y “comes from” the construction via φ; no classification statement.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: For X path connected and locally simply connected, a group Γ, and φ : π1(X) → Γ, and a Γ-action on Xφ, then pφ : Xφ → X is a Γ-covering space with Γ ≅ π1(X), and any connected Γ-covering space Y → X arises from this construction for some φ.
- Mismatches:
  - The code never states that pφ is a covering map, nor that it is a Γ-covering.
  - The code does not assert Γ ≅ π1(X) anywhere.
  - The construction is not tied to the provided Xφ, pφ; instead it asserts existence of some Y, action, and continuity only.
  - The classification theorem omits the covering hypothesis entirely and only assumes a Γ-action and continuity, concluding merely the existence of a homomorphism π1(X) → Γ (which is trivial), not that Y arises from the construction.
  - The assumptions path connected and locally simply connected are not used; “locally_simply_connected” is just an unused Prop, not a Mathlib property, and PathConnectedSpace X is unused.
  - No Mathlib covering space notions are used (e.g., no CoveringMap/IsCover/IsLocallyTrivial/IsGaloisCover, etc.).

Final check:
- The formal statements are far weaker and largely unrelated to the classification of Γ-covering spaces. They omit essential notions (coverings, group isomorphism, the specific construction from φ, and the universality/classification direction). Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the original statement.

Grade justification:
- The code touches on π1 and Γ but fails to encode any of the key content (Γ-covering, isomorphism Γ ≅ π1(X), classification, or dependence on φ and the action on Xφ). It also introduces an unused arbitrary Prop for local simple connectedness. This is highly unfaithful. A very low grade is appropriate.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- Docstring: Describes the intended topology on `Option X` where `none` plays the role of ∞. It says a set U ⊆ Option X is open iff either (a) it does not contain `none` and its preimage under `some` is open in X, or (b) it contains `none` and there is a compact C ⊆ X with U = {none} ∪ (some '' (X \ C)). This matches the standard one-point compactification description in the NL statement.
- `def one_point_compactification (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : TopologicalSpace (Option X) := by sorry`: This attempts to define a topology on `Option X`. However, the entire construction is left as `sorry`, i.e., a placeholder, so no actual definition is provided and no axioms are checked.

Step 2: Does the code faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement asks to prove that the given rule for open sets defines a topology on X ∪ {∞}. A faithful Lean translation would either:
  - Define `IsOpen` on `Option X` using those clauses and then show the topological axioms (providing a `TopologicalSpace (Option X)`), or
  - State and prove a theorem that the described collection is a topology.
- The code only provides a def with a `sorry`, so it neither defines the open sets nor proves the axioms. The docstring states the intended definition, but the actual Lean object is vacuous. This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Intended target: Show the specified collection of sets is a topology on X ∪ {∞}.
- Actual Lean content: A placeholder definition of a `TopologicalSpace (Option X)` with no content connecting it to the described open sets. No proof that the axioms hold. No guarantee it matches the described open sets.
- Differences:
  - The Lean definition is not implemented; it uses `sorry` (vacuous).
  - No theorem or definition ensures the described open sets are exactly the opens of the defined topology.
  - It does not use Mathlib's standard naming (`OnePoint X`) or `IsCompact` explicitly, and more importantly, does not formalize any of the conditions.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the `sorry` were replaced by a genuine construction matching the docstring (and verifying the axioms), it would be faithful. As is, it fails due to vacuity.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.

- def f0 (x : X) : Y := F (⟨0, ...⟩, x): Define f0 by evaluating F at time 0.
- def f1 (x : X) : Y := F (⟨1, ...⟩, x): Define f1 by evaluating F at time 1.
- variable {x0 x1 : X} {y0 y1 : Y}: Fix arbitrary points x0, x1 in X and y0, y1 in Y (no relation to f0, f1 stated).

- variable (y_star : FundamentalGroup Y y0 → FundamentalGroup Y y1): Similarly postulate an arbitrary function (claimed conjugation, no path).
- variable (f0_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup Y y0): Postulate an arbitrary induced map for f0 (but not actually defined via f0).
- variable (f1_star : FundamentalGroup X x1 → FundamentalGroup Y y1): Postulate an arbitrary induced map for f1 (but not actually defined via f1).
- theorem homotopy_induces_conjugation_relation : (y_star ∘ f0_star) = (f1_star ∘ x_star) := by sorry: Assert an equality of these arbitrary functions; no hypotheses relate them to F, x, y, etc.; proof omitted.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Original statement requires:
- F is a homotopy (continuous map I × X → Y), with f_t(x) = F(t, x) and thus f0, f1 are continuous maps X → Y.
- Given x0, x1 in X; define y0 = f0(x0), y1 = f1(x1).
- A specified path x: I → X from x0 to x1, and defined y(t) = F(t, x(t)) a path from y0 to y1.
- x_* and y_* are the isomorphisms on fundamental groups induced by conjugation with the paths x and y respectively.
- The statement to prove: y_* ∘ (f0)_* = (f1)_* ∘ x_* as homomorphisms π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, y1).

In the Lean code:
- F is just an arbitrary function; continuity and homotopy structure are not assumed.
- y0 and y1 are arbitrary points unrelated to f0(x0) and f1(x1).
- There is no path x : I → X or y : I → Y defined, let alone conditions that x is from x0 to x1 or y(t) = F(t, x(t)).
- x_star and y_star are arbitrary functions, not defined via conjugation by x and y.
- f0_star and f1_star are arbitrary functions, not the induced homomorphisms (f0)_*, (f1)_*.
- The final theorem claims an unconditional equality of compositions of arbitrary functions without any of the necessary hypotheses.

Thus, the code does not encode the mathematical content of the statement; it uses vacuous placeholders for all the essential constructions and omits all required hypotheses and definitions tying the objects together. It is not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Missing continuity/homotopy hypothesis for F.
- Missing relations y0 = f0(x0), y1 = f1(x1).
- Missing path x and derived path y.
- x_* and y_* not defined via conjugation by paths; f0_* and f1_* not defined as induced maps.
- The theorem asserts equality without hypotheses, hence not the same statement.

Verdict: Not faithful. Multiple vacuous/placeholder definitions; the final theorem is not the same problem.

The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let f : X → Y be a map of topological spaces. Show that f is continuous if and only if for every subset A ⊆ Y one has overline(f^{-1}(A)) = f^{-1}(overline A).""
- Lean: Precisely the same quantification and equality, using Mathlib's `closure` for topological closure and `f ⁻¹' A` for set preimage; `Continuous f` is the standard Mathlib predicate for continuity.

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no placeholders beyond the proof omission (which is allowed by the instructions).
- Uses standard Mathlib notions correctly.
- The statement exactly mirrors the natural language claim, including the universal quantification over all subsets A of Y and the equality of the two sets.

Final check: The two statements are the same. There are no mismatches in hypotheses or conclusions, and the formalization is faithful to the original text.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- It sets up three types X, Y, Z with topologies on each (TopologicalSpace X, Y, Z).
- It defines a predicate is_covering_map (f : X → Y) : Prop := True. This is explicitly a placeholder: it asserts nothing about f beyond a vacuous truth.
- The theorem covering_map_lift_unique states: given f : X → Y, an assumption hf : is_covering_map f, an assumption hX : T2Space X (i.e., X is Hausdorff), maps g₁ g₂ : Z → X, an equality of compositions hfg : f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂, a point z0 : Z, and equality at that point h0 : g₁ z0 = g₂ z0, then g₁ = g₂. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Let f : X → Y be a covering map with X Hausdorff and Y a topological space. If g₁, g₂ : Z → X satisfy f(g₁(z)) = f(g₂(z)) for all z ∈ Z, and g₁(z₀) = g₂(z₀) for some z₀, then g₁ = g₂.
- The Lean theorem mirrors the hypotheses and conclusion structurally: Hausdorffness of X is assumed (hX : T2Space X), Y has a topology, the pointwise condition f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ is present, and equality at a point is included to conclude g₁ = g₂.

Critical issues (why the translation fails):
- The predicate is_covering_map is a vacuous placeholder defined as True. This does not faithfully encode “f is a covering map.” Under this definition, hf carries no actual content, and the theorem’s statement becomes strictly stronger than the NL statement (it would claim the uniqueness conclusion for any f and Hausdorff X, not just covering maps).
- No other auxiliary definitions are used; the only auxiliary predicate is vacuous, violating the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not placeholders.

Final check:
- Apart from the placeholder, the theorem’s structure matches the NL sentence: same quantifiers and assumptions, same conclusion. If is_covering_map were replaced by a legitimate Mathlib definition of covering maps, the statement would be faithful.
- Because the only auxiliary definition is vacuous, the translation fails per the strict rules.

Grade rationale:
- This fits the rubric “makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” so grade 6.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- We fix a topological space X and an index type A, together with a family of subsets X_a : A → Set X. We pick a basepoint x0 : X.
- Hypothesis ha: for every a, x0 ∈ X_a a. So each X_a contains the basepoint.
- Hypothesis hpath: for every a, X_a a is path-connected (IsPathConnected (X_a a)).
- Hypothesis hpath_inter: for every a b, the intersection X_a a ∩ X_a b is path-connected.
- Hypothesis hcover: the X_a cover X, i.e., ⋃ a, X_a a = univ.
- Let Γ be a group.
- We are given group homomorphisms incl_a: π1({x : X // x ∈ X_a a}, ⟨x0, ha a⟩) →* π1(X, x0) for each a. These are arbitrary maps between fundamental groups of the subspace and X (not asserted to be induced by the inclusions, though that is presumably intended).
- Likewise, for each a b, we are given incl_ab_a: π1({x : X // x ∈ X_a a ∩ X_a b}, ⟨x0, ⟨ha a, ha b⟩⟩) →* π1({x : X // x ∈ X_a a}, ⟨x0, ha a⟩) and incl_ab_b: ... →* π1({x : X // x ∈ X_a b}, ⟨x0, ha b⟩). Again, not asserted to be the canonical maps induced by inclusions, just abstract homomorphisms with the right types.
- Hypothesis incl_compat: for all a b, the two composites to π1(X, x0) agree: (incl_a a) ∘ (incl_ab_a a b) = (incl_a b) ∘ (incl_ab_b a b).
- We are given φ: for each a, a homomorphism φ a: π1(X_a, x0) →* Γ.
- Hypothesis φ_compat: for all a b, φ a ∘ incl_ab_a a b = φ b ∘ incl_ab_b a b.
- Conclusion: there exists a unique Φ: π1(X, x0) →* Γ such that for all a, Φ ∘ incl_a a = φ a.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement assumes: X is path connected and locally simply connected; {X_a} is a cover by path connected open sets; every (finite) intersection X_ab is path connected. It fixes a basepoint x0 and defines π = π1(X, x0), π_a = π1(X_a, x0), etc. Given a group Γ and homomorphisms π_a → Γ that agree on every π_ab, there is a unique homomorphism π → Γ extending the given morphisms.

Mismatches / issues:
1) Missing local simple connectivity: The Lean theorem does not assume X is locally simply connected (nor locally path-connected, nor simple connectivity assumptions on intersections). This is a key hypothesis in the NL statement. The Lean theorem is strictly stronger than the NL statement and thus not a faithful translation.
2) Missing openness: The NL statement requires each X_a to be open; the Lean code has no IsOpen X_a a hypotheses. This is another missing assumption.
3) Canonical inclusion-induced maps vs arbitrary maps: The NL statement implicitly uses the canonical maps on fundamental groups induced by the inclusions X_ab → X_a and X_a → X. The Lean statement takes as data arbitrary group homomorphisms incl_a, incl_ab_a, incl_ab_b merely satisfying a compatibility equation. There is no assertion that these are the inclusion-induced maps. This changes the meaning: it demands the universal property with respect to any such compatible system, not just the canonical one from inclusions.
4) Global path-connectedness of X: The NL statement assumes X is path connected. The Lean statement does not include IsPathConnected X. While the given ha (basepoint in each X_a) and path-connectedness of each X_a imply the union is path-connected, this is not stated; nonetheless, the conclusion does not require this explicitly. Still, it’s a divergence from the stated hypotheses.
5) Coverage: The Lean code includes an explicit cover hypothesis hcover, which matches the notion of “covering by {X_a}”. Good.
6) Pairwise intersections only: The Lean code uses pairwise intersections. The NL text says “every finite intersection X_ab := X_a ∩ X_b is path connected,” which as written only mentions pairwise, though the word “finite” might suggest higher intersections. The Lean code only handles pairwise; this is at best consistent with the phrasing actually used in the NL statement.

Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean statement omits key hypotheses (locally simply connected, openness), and it quantifies over arbitrary homomorphisms between the fundamental groups rather than the canonical ones induced by inclusions. This makes the Lean version both stronger and different in meaning from the NL statement. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Setup: X is a topological space, A is a subset of X. The subspace topology on A is represented via the subtype Subtype A, whose elements are pairs a with a.val ∈ X and a.property ∈ A.

- Theorem isClosed_subspace_iff:
  Statement: For a set S ⊆ Subtype A, S is closed in the subspace topology on A if and only if there exists a closed set C ⊆ X such that S = { a : Subtype A | (a : X) ∈ C }.
  Interpretation: The set { a : Subtype A | (a : X) ∈ C } is exactly the preimage of C under the inclusion map coe : A → X. Viewed as a subset of X (by identifying a set of Subtype A with its image in X), this is A ∩ C. Thus, the theorem says: closed subsets of A (in the subspace topology) are exactly the sets of the form A ∩ C with C closed in X.

- Theorem closure_subspace:
  Statement: For S ⊆ Subtype A, the closure of S in the subspace A equals the set { a : Subtype A | (a : X) ∈ closure ((coe : Subtype A → X) '' S) }.
  Interpretation: The right-hand side says: those points of A whose underlying X-point lies in the closure in X of the image of S under the inclusion A → X. Identifying subsets of Subtype A with subsets of X contained in A, this is exactly A ∩ closure_X(S), i.e., the intersection of A with the closure of S in X.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First part (closed sets in subspace): The Lean statement gives an iff between ""S is closed in A"" and ""S is the preimage of some closed C in X under the inclusion"", which is exactly the standard formulation that closed sets in A are precisely the intersections A ∩ C with C closed in X. The use of Subtype A and the set {a | (a : X) ∈ C} faithfully represents A ∩ C.
- Second part (closure): The Lean statement identifies closure in the subspace with {a ∈ A | coe a ∈ closure_X(image of S)}; this is precisely A ∩ closure_X(S), noting that S as a subset of A is identified with its image in X.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Type-level identification: The code phrases sets as subsets of Subtype A rather than subsets of X, but via the canonical identification (elements of Subtype A are already in A), {a | (a : X) ∈ C} is the same as A ∩ C, and the closure statement is A ∩ closure_X(S). This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- Quantifiers/directions: The first theorem is an iff, matching the ""exactly the sets"" phrasing. The second theorem matches the ""equals the intersection"" statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are faithful translations of the natural language claims, using standard Mathlib notions without any vacuous placeholders.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib; open Matrix; variable {n : ℕ}: Set up Mathlib and work with n×n real matrices indexed by Fin n.
- def gram (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ := Matrix.transpose M * M: Defines the Gram matrix of M as Mᵀ M. Interpreting M as the matrix whose columns are v₁,…,vₙ ∈ ℝⁿ, this is the usual Gram matrix with entries ⟨vᵢ, vⱼ⟩ in the standard Euclidean inner product.
- theorem exists_continuous_g (f : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f) (hU : ∀ (U : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ), Matrix.transpose U * U = 1 -> ∀ M, f (U * M) = f M) : ∃ (g : {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // ∃ M, A = gram M} → ℝ), Continuous g ∧ ∀ M, g ⟨gram M, ⟨M, rfl⟩⟩ = f M := by sorry
  - f is a continuous function on n×n real matrices; interpret each M as the n-tuple of vectors given by its columns. So f encodes a continuous function of n vectors in ℝⁿ.
  - hU says: for every U with UᵀU = I (i.e., orthogonal), and every M, f(U M) = f(M). This matches invariance under simultaneous orthogonal transformations: multiplying all vectors by the same orthogonal U.
  - Conclusion: There exists a function g defined on the subtype {A | ∃ M, A = gram M} (i.e., the set of Gram matrices) which is continuous, and satisfies g(gram M) = f(M) for all M.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL statement: f(v₁,…,vₙ) continuous and O(n)-invariant. Y is the set of positive semidefinite symmetric n×n matrices. There exists a continuous g : Y → ℝ such that f(v₁,…,vₙ) = g(A) where A is the Gram matrix Aᵢⱼ = ⟨vᵢ, vⱼ⟩.
- Code: Uses M ∈ Matrix(ℝ) as a stand-in for the n-tuple (v₁,…,vₙ) (columns). The invariance under U with UᵀU = I exactly matches O(n)-invariance. The map gram M = MᵀM produces the Gram matrix. The target set for g is the subtype {A | ∃ M, A = MᵀM}, i.e., the image of the Gram map. Over ℝ, this set is exactly the set of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices Y. Continuity of g is stated in the subtype topology, which coincides with the subspace topology on Y.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Main subtle difference: The code defines the target space of g as the image of the gram map rather than explicitly as the set Y of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Mathematically these sets coincide (every Gram matrix is symmetric PSD, and every symmetric PSD real matrix can be written as Mᵀ M), so the statement is logically equivalent. The code does not explicitly use Mathlib's predicates for symmetry or positive semidefinite; it instead characterizes Y via the image of the gram map. This is acceptable as a faithful restatement, though it could have used Mathlib's standard notions.
- Everything else matches: the domain of f (n-tuples of vectors via matrices), the orthogonal invariance (UᵀU = I), the definition of the Gram matrix, and the factoring f = g ∘ gram with g continuous.
- No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition gram is correct and meaningful. The use of sorry in the proof is allowed under the auditing task, as we only check the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the NL statement, with a mild definitional variation of Y that is mathematically equivalent.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The file imports Mathlib, sets universes, and opens Topology.
- It defines `amalgamated_free_product {ι} (G : ι → Type) (R : ι → ι → Type) : Type := PUnit`. This is explicitly labeled as a placeholder/stub. It does not implement the amalgamated free product (no group structure, no inclusions of the intersection groups into the pieces, and it's definitionally the trivial type `PUnit`).
- The theorem `van_kampen_amalgamation` assumes:
  - `X` is a topological space, `U : ι → Set X` a family of subsets, and a basepoint `x0 : X`.
  - `h_cover : (⋃ i, U i) = univ` meaning the `U i` cover `X`.
  - `h_path : IsPathConnected (univ : Set X)` meaning `X` is path-connected.
  - `h_open : ∀ i, IsOpen (U i)` so each `U i` is open.
  - `h_contains : ∀ i, x0 ∈ U i` so the basepoint lies in every `U i`.
  - `h_path_conn : ∀ i, IsPathConnected (U i)` each `U i` is path-connected.
  - `h_path_conn_inter : ∀ i j, IsPathConnected (U i ∩ U j)` each pairwise intersection is path-connected.
  Conclusion:
  - There exists an equivalence of types (not groups) `FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃ amalgamated_free_product ...`, where the family of factors is `FundamentalGroup (Subtype (U i)) ⟨x0, h_contains i⟩` and the “relations” are typed as `FundamentalGroup (Subtype (U i ∩ U j)) ⟨x0, And.intro (h_contains i) (h_contains j)⟩`.
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- NL statement: X is path connected and locally simply connected; {X_a} is a cover by path-connected open sets with path-connected intersections, all containing x0. Then π = π1(X, x0) is the amalgamated free product of the π_a = π1(X_a, x0) over the π_ab = π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0).
- Issues:
  1) The code uses a completely vacuous placeholder for the amalgamated free product: `amalgamated_free_product := PUnit`. This defeats the essence of the claim. Moreover, the amalgam must include data of the inclusion homomorphisms of intersection groups into the piece groups; the stub does not even accept or encode such maps.
  2) The conclusion asserts a mere type equivalence `Equiv` (and wrapped in `Nonempty`), not a group isomorphism. It ignores the group structure entirely. The NL statement is about an isomorphism of groups.
  3) The hypotheses omit “locally simply connected” for X, which is included in the NL statement. The code asserts the result under (arguably) different hypotheses (possibly stronger or weaker depending on the standard variant), thus not a faithful translation.
  4) Even if we replaced the placeholder with an actual type, the theorem signature still lacks the inclusion homomorphisms needed to define an amalgamated free product; the current `R : ι → ι → Type` argument is just a family of types for intersections, not a system of subgroup embeddings. So the statement itself is structurally insufficient to express the amalgamation correctly.
  5) Using Nonempty (… ≃ …) is also too weak: it does not identify a canonical isomorphism, and again ignores group structure.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
- No. The Lean code makes a vacuous auxiliary definition, fails to speak about group isomorphism to a genuine amalgamated free product with inclusion maps, omits the locally simply connected hypothesis, and only asserts existence of a type equivalence to a trivial placeholder type. This is not a faithful translation of the NL theorem.

Grade rationale:
- The code uses a vacuous placeholder and even if that were replaced, the theorem’s signature lacks the necessary homomorphisms and uses type equivalence instead of group isomorphism. Also it misses the locally simply connected assumption. Hence, even after fixing the placeholder, the statement would still not be faithful without further changes. This matches the rubric around 3.

- Content-wise, the two equalities stated in Lean match exactly the two equalities in the NL statement (interior of product equals product of interiors; closure of product equals product of closures). Equality direction is immaterial.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - The NL statement mentions only one space X, while forming the product A × B. This usually means A, B ⊆ X and the product is taken in X × X. The Lean code allows two possibly different spaces α and β, i.e., A ⊆ α and B ⊆ β, so it is a slight generalization.
  - Otherwise, the mathematical content of each equality is the same.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the statements use standard Mathlib notions (interior, closure, ×ˢ). No auxiliary definitions are introduced.
- Conclusion: The translation is faithful to the intended mathematical statements, with a benign generalization to possibly distinct factors.

The proof is omitted, but only the statement matters here.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: For a Serre fibration f: X → Y (maps of topological spaces with basepoints), the “obvious” maps π_n(F, x0) → π_n(X, x0) → π_n(Y, y0) → π_{n-1}(F, x0) fit into a long exact sequence.
- The code tries to assert the existence of maps i, j, δ forming a long exact sequence. However:
  - No TopologicalSpace structures are present on X, Y, or the fiber, so talking about π_n is not grounded. π is a bare constant type family, not Mathlib's homotopy groups or any defined notion.
  - Serre_fibration is a completely uninterpreted predicate on functions between types, not a genuine definition of Serre fibration for topological spaces.
  - is_long_exact_sequence is an uninterpreted predicate; it does not formalize exactness or compatibility conditions.
  - The statement labels the maps as “obvious,” but the code only asserts existence, without tying them to any standard constructions.
  - The indexing: δ has type ∀ n, π n Y y0 → π (n - 1) (fiber f y0) ... Using Nat subtraction means at n = 0 one gets a map to π 0 (fiber f y0), which is not standard in the classical LES. While an uninterpreted is_long_exact_sequence could choose to only use these maps for n ≥ 1, the code nevertheless supplies δ for all n, which deviates from the usual formulation.
- Because of the uninterpreted placeholders, the statement does not truly capture the intended topological content.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
Differences:
- Missing topological structure: The NL statement is about topological spaces and homotopy groups; the code uses raw types with no TopologicalSpace instances.
- Placeholders/uninterpreted symbols: Serre_fibration, π, and is_long_exact_sequence are all uninterpreted constants, not faithful Mathlib definitions. This is a critical mismatch.
- Exactness not defined: is_long_exact_sequence does not formalize exactness; it is just a Prop constant.
- Indexing subtlety: The δ map is given for all n with Nat subtraction; this deviates from the standard LES specification, which typically only gives δ for n ≥ 1 (and then transitions to π_0 terms appropriately).
- “Obvious maps” vs mere existence: The code asserts existence of some maps i, j, δ rather than the canonical ones, and does not constrain them to be the standard constructions.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It relies on vacuous, uninterpreted placeholders instead of Mathlib definitions, lacks necessary topological structure, and does not genuinely encode the long exact sequence of homotopy groups.

Grade rationale: Although the high-level shape (existence of maps forming a long exact sequence) mimics the natural language theorem, the use of uninterpreted constants and missing topological structure means it fails the fidelity requirement. If the placeholders were replaced with rigorous Mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace, pointed spaces, homotopy groups, exactness), the overall statement could be faithful. Hence a mid score.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are types with topologies.
- `variable (s : Setoid X)`: s is an equivalence relation on X.
- `def q : X → Quotient s := Quotient.mk s`: Define the canonical quotient map q from X to the quotient type Quotient s (i.e., X/∼).
- `lemma continuous_iff_compose_quotient {h : Quotient s → Y} : Continuous h ↔ Continuous (h ∘ q s) := ...`: A function h from the quotient space to Y is continuous if and only if the composition h ∘ q is continuous on X.
- `lemma continuous_descends_iff_constant_on_classes {F : X → Y} (hF : Continuous F) : (∃ (h : Quotient s → Y), (h ∘ q s = F) ∧ Continuous h) ↔ (∀ x1 x2 : X, (Setoid.r s x1 x2) → F x1 = F x2) := ...`: Given a continuous F : X → Y, there exists a continuous h : Quotient s → Y with h ∘ q = F if and only if F is constant on equivalence classes (i.e., F x1 = F x2 whenever x1 ∼ x2).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First part (induced continuity): The NL asks to show that if h : X/∼ → Y is continuous then h ∘ q : X → Y is continuous. The Lean lemma states the stronger equivalence: Continuous h ↔ Continuous (h ∘ q). This is consistent with the universal property of the quotient topology and is stronger than requested. This is fine content-wise; it does not contradict the NL statement.
- Second part (descending criterion): The NL says that a continuous map f : X → Y arises as f = h ∘ q for a unique continuous h if and only if f is constant on equivalence classes. The Lean lemma states an equivalence between the existence of a continuous h with h ∘ q = F and the constancy of F on equivalence classes, assuming F is continuous. However, it does not state uniqueness of h. In fact, for quotient sets, uniqueness of h (as a function, hence also as a continuous function if it exists) should be included. This uniqueness is missing in the Lean statement, so it is weaker than the NL statement.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- First lemma: Stronger than needed but faithful to the notion of quotient maps. Acceptable.
- Second lemma: Missing the uniqueness clause. The NL requires that f arises in this way for a unique continuous h; the Lean code only asserts existence. This is a substantive omission, so the translation is not fully faithful.

Other checks:
- No vacuous placeholders for definitions; q is correctly defined as Quotient.mk s. Proofs are omitted with `admit`, but the task allows statements without proofs.
- Uses standard Mathlib constructs (Setoid, Quotient, Continuous). Good.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to omission of uniqueness in the second statement. Everything else matches or is a harmless strengthening.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The context sets X as a topological space and A as an index type. U : A → Set X is a family of subsets of X, with hUopen asserting each U a is open, and hcover asserting that the union of all U a equals all of X (i.e., U covers X).
- The map x : ContinuousMap ℝ X is a continuous function from the real line ℝ to X. The hypothesis hpath : x '' Icc 0 1 ⊆ univ is trivially true (the image of any function into X is contained in univ : Set X), so it carries no information.
- The conclusion asserts the existence of a natural number n, a function t : ℕ → ℝ, and a function a : ℕ → A, such that t 0 = 0, t n = 1, and for every i < n, we have t i < t (i+1) and x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) ⊆ U (a i). Here, Set.image x (Set.Icc (t i) (t (i+1))) is the same as x '' [t_i, t_{i+1}]. Thus, it asserts a finite strictly increasing partition 0 = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_n = 1 and for each adjacent subinterval [t_i, t_{i+1}], the image under x is contained in some U (a_i).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- NL statement: Let X be covered by open sets {X_a}_{a∈A} and let x : [0,1] → X be a path (i.e., a continuous map on the closed interval). Then there exist real numbers 0 = t_0 < ... < t_n = 1 and indices a_0, ..., a_{n-1} such that x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) ⊆ X_{a_i} for each i.
- The cover and the conclusion in the Lean code match the NL statement: the existence of a finite partition of [0,1] with each piece mapped inside a single open set of the cover is correctly encoded.
- However, the function x in the Lean code is a continuous map from ℝ to X, not from [0,1] to X. This is a strictly stronger hypothesis than in the NL statement: it requires the path to extend to a continuous map on all of ℝ. Not every continuous x : [0,1] → X admits such an extension to ℝ for general X. Therefore, the Lean statement applies to fewer maps than the NL statement. This is a loss of generality and thus not a faithful translation.
- The extra hypothesis hpath is vacuous (x '' Icc(0,1) ⊆ univ), providing no additional information and suggesting a mismatch in intent.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- Same: The cover by open sets, the partition 0 = t_0 < ... < t_n = 1, and the inclusion x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) ⊆ U (a_i) all match the NL statement.
- Different: The domain of the path. The NL requires a continuous function defined on [0,1]; the Lean code requires a continuous function defined on ℝ. This is a nontrivial strengthening of the hypothesis and excludes general paths that do not extend to ℝ. Also, the inclusion of the vacuous hypothesis hpath is an oddity, though not directly harmful.

Conclusion: Because of the incorrect domain for x (ℝ instead of [0,1]), the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the NL statement. No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present, and the rest of the statement is close, so this is ""almost the same"" but not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- import Mathlib; noncomputable section; open Real, Classical: setup. Fine.
- def E (n) := Fin n → ℝ; def F (n) := ℝ × E n: models ℝ^n and ℝ^{n+1} (as ℝ × ℝ^n). Faithful.
- def eucl_norm (x : E n) := sqrt (∑ i, (x i)^2): Euclidean norm on ℝ^n. Faithful.
- def eucl_norm_F (z : F n) := sqrt (z.1^2 + ∑ i, (z.2 i)^2): Euclidean norm on ℝ^{n+1}. Faithful.
- def X := {x | eucl_norm x ≤ 1}: closed unit ball. Faithful.
- def A := {x | eucl_norm x = 1}: boundary sphere of radius 1. Faithful.
- def Y := {y | eucl_norm_F y = 1}: unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}. Faithful.
- def f (x : E n) : F n := let r := eucl_norm x; if r = 0 then (1, 0) else (cos (π r), fun i => sin (π r) * (r⁻¹ * x i)). This matches the piecewise definition f(x) = (cos(π‖x‖), sin(π‖x‖) x/‖x‖) with f(0) = (1,0). The codomain is F n (ℝ^{n+1}), not the sphere Y. The definition itself is faithful to the formula.
- theorem f_injective_on_interior: Given x,y ∈ X \ A and f x = f y, then x = y. This is exactly saying f is injective on X \ A (the interior of X in this context), stated in a pointwise form. Faithful to the injectivity claim.
- theorem f_maps_A_to_neg_one: If a ∈ A, then f a = (-1, 0). This expresses that every boundary point maps to the single point (−1,0). It does not explicitly assert that (−1,0) ∈ Y, but it identifies the image uniquely with that point (which indeed lies in Y by the earlier definition). The statement matches the intended mapping claim.

2) Overall faithfulness:
- The core claims to be proved are (i) injectivity on the interior X \ A and (ii) that every point of A is mapped to (−1,0). The Lean statements reflect both of these as theorems (without proofs, which is acceptable per the instructions).
- However, the natural language statement types the function as f : X → Y (i.e., f is defined on X and its image lies in Y). In the Lean code, f is defined on all of E n with codomain F n, and there is no assertion that f maps X into Y. The second theorem fixes the image on A, but there is no theorem stating f x ∈ Y for all x ∈ X (or even for x ∈ X \ A). Thus the type-level part “f : X → Y” is not captured.
- Using custom Euclidean norms instead of Mathlib’s EuclideanSpace/norm is acceptable since the definitions are faithful and non-vacuous.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: definitions of X, A, Y; the formula for f; the injectivity-on-interior statement; the constancy on A statement.
- Differences: the codomain/type of f is F n (ℝ^{n+1}), not Y; the code does not assert that f(X) ⊆ Y, whereas the natural-language statement explicitly gives f : X → Y. Also, the theorem about boundary does not explicitly include “(−1,0) ∈ Y,” though the identified point is indeed in Y by definition.

Given the instruction to be extra harsh, the missing typing f : X → Y (or an explicit lemma f x ∈ Y for x ∈ X) is a material mismatch. Therefore the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful.

- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, including topology on quotients and continuity notions.
- variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]: X and Y are topological spaces.
- variable [s : Setoid X]: We fix an equivalence relation ~ on X, modeled as a Setoid s.

This matches the usual descent criterion. The hypothesis hF : Continuous F matches the “Conversely, a continuous map F …” phrasing in the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- First part: “A map h : X/∼ → Y is continuous iff h ∘ q is continuous.” The lemma continuous_iff_compose_quotient matches exactly.
- Second part: “Conversely, a continuous map F : X → Y descends to a continuous map X/∼ → Y iff F(x1)=F(x2) whenever x1 ∼ x2.” The lemma continuous_descends_iff_constant_on_classes states the equivalence between existence of a continuous h with h ∘ q = F and F being constant on equivalence classes, under the assumption that F is continuous. This is precisely the intended statement of “descends to a continuous map.”
- The use of Setoid and Quotient s is standard Mathlib modeling of quotients; the topology on Quotient s is the canonical quotient topology provided by Mathlib. No vacuous placeholders are used; q is the genuine projection.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code includes the continuity of F as an explicit hypothesis in the second lemma, which aligns with the natural language statement’s “Conversely, a continuous map F …” wording. The equivalence presented matches the descent condition. There are no extraneous or missing conditions, and no vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- Therefore, the Lean statements faithfully translate the original mathematical statements.

  - X is a topological space.
  - x, y : ℝ → X, τ : ℝ → ℝ (we will only use them on I = [0,1]).
  - hx : ContinuousOn x I, hy : ContinuousOn y I: x and y are continuous on [0,1]; i.e., paths.

  - hstrict : StrictMonoOn τ I: τ is strictly increasing on [0,1].
  - h0 : τ 0 = 0, h1 : τ 1 = 1: endpoint conditions.
  - hreparam : ∀ t ∈ I, y (τ t) = x t: y ∘ τ = x on [0,1] (reparametrization).
  Conclusion:
  - ∃ H : ℝ × ℝ → X with ContinuousOn H (I.prod I): there exists a homotopy H defined on ℝ×ℝ that is continuous on [0,1]×[0,1].
  - (∀ t ∈ I, H (t, 0) = x t) and (∀ t ∈ I, H (t, 1) = y t): at s=0 we get x, at s=1 we get y.
  - (∀ s ∈ I, H (0, s) = x 0) and (∀ s ∈ I, H (1, s) = x 1): the endpoints t=0 and t=1 are fixed along the homotopy, at values x 0 and x 1.
  This encodes a homotopy relative to the endpoints. Since hreparam with h0,h1 implies y 0 = x 0 and y 1 = x 1, the boundary conditions are equivalent to being homotopic relative {0,1}.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL: X topological space; x,y : [0,1] → X are paths. There exists a continuous strictly increasing τ : [0,1] → [0,1] with τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1, and y ∘ τ = x. Prove x is homotopic to y relative {0,1}.
- Lean hypotheses exactly encode: continuity of x,y on [0,1]; τ continuous on [0,1] and maps [0,1] into itself; τ strictly increasing; τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1; and y ∘ τ = x on [0,1].
- Lean conclusion exactly expresses the existence of a continuous H on [0,1]×[0,1] with H(t,0)=x t, H(t,1)=y t, and endpoints fixed along s. Using hreparam + endpoint equalities, this is precisely a homotopy relative {0,1}.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Domain/codomain nuances: Lean uses ℝ→X with ContinuousOn on I rather than functions on the subtype [0,1]; this is a standard and faithful encoding.
- τ is a map ℝ→ℝ with image condition τ '' I ⊆ I; this matches τ : [0,1] → [0,1].
- Strictly increasing is encoded as StrictMonoOn τ I; faithful.
- Homotopy relative {0,1} is encoded by boundary conditions H(0,s)=x 0 and H(1,s)=x 1; since y(0)=x(0) and y(1)=x(1) follow from the assumptions, this is equivalent to the usual statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the auxiliary def I is legitimate.
- The proof is omitted, which is allowed for this translation task.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language theorem.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- The file imports Mathlib and works noncomputably. It opens Set.
- def X : Type := { t : ℝ // t ∈ Icc 0 1 }
  Interprets X as the closed interval [0,1] as a subtype of ℝ. This matches the problem statement.
- def f (t : X) : ℝ × ℝ := (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi * t.val), Real.sin (2 * Real.pi * t.val))
  Defines f: X → ℝ × ℝ by f(t) = (cos(2π t), sin(2π t)). Matches the problem statement.
- def Y : Type := { p : ℝ × ℝ // p ∈ Set.range (fun t : X => f t) }
  Defines Y as the subtype of ℝ² consisting of points in the image of f, i.e., Y = { (cos(2π t), sin(2π t)) | t ∈ [0,1] }. This matches the problem statement's Y.
- def r (a b : X) : Prop := f a = f b
  Defines an equivalence relation on X by identifying points with the same f-value (the kernel relation of f). For this particular f, this identifies 0 and 1 and no other distinct points in [0,1], so it matches the intended identification.
- noncomputable def s : Setoid X := …
  Packages r into a setoid, proving reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity via equality. Legitimate.
- noncomputable def quotient_Icc_endpoints_homeomorphic_circle {instQ : TopologicalSpace (Quotient s)} {instY : TopologicalSpace Y} : Homeomorph (Quotient s) Y := by sorry
  States (with proof omitted) that the quotient of X by s is homeomorphic to Y. However, it takes arbitrary topological structures instQ on Quotient s and instY on Y as implicit parameters, not the canonical ones.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The objects X, f, and Y are defined as in the problem. Good.
- The equivalence relation r corresponds, for this specific f, to identifying exactly the endpoints 0 and 1 (and otherwise only equality). So using r to form the quotient matches the intended quotient X/{0,1}.
- Critical issue: The theorem statement quantifies over arbitrary topologies on (Quotient s) and Y. The natural language statement refers to the quotient topology on X/~ and the subspace topology on Y ⊆ ℝ². Declaring {instQ : TopologicalSpace (Quotient s)} and {instY : TopologicalSpace Y} as arbitrary parameters asserts a homeomorphism for all choices of topologies, which is generally false and not faithful to the intended statement. The code should rely on the canonical typeclass instances (the quotient topology on Quotient s inherited from X, and the subspace topology on Y inherited from ℝ²) rather than universally quantifying over arbitrary topologies.
- Minor stylistic point: The quotient is formed via the kernel of f rather than explicitly identifying only 0 and 1, but for this f these relations coincide; thus this is acceptable as a faithful formulation.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Almost, but not exactly. The Lean statement, by taking arbitrary TopologicalSpace structures on the source and target, states a much stronger and incorrect claim (existence of a homeomorphism for any topologies), rather than the specific homeomorphism between the canonical quotient topology on X/{0,1} and the subspace topology on Y.
- Everything else (definitions of X, f, Y, and the relation) aligns correctly, and there are no vacuous placeholders besides the omitted proof. But the topologies issue is substantial and breaks faithfulness.

Suggested fix to be faithful: Remove the explicit parameters {instQ …} {instY …} and rely on the standard instances, e.g.
  noncomputable def quotient_Icc_endpoints_homeomorphic_circle : Homeomorph (Quotient s) Y := …
so that (Quotient s) carries the quotient topology from X and Y carries the subspace topology from ℝ².
