Lemma (informal): Let U ⊂ ℂ be open and f : U → ℂ holomorphic. Suppose f is not constant and f'(z0)=0.
Then z0 is a zero of f' of some finite order.

The statement below formalises this by producing a radius r>0 and an integer n ≥ 0 and an analytic function g
on the ball of radius r around z0 with g(z0) ≠ 0 such that on that ball we have
  deriv f z = (z - z0)^n * g z.

Let U ⊂ ℂ be a domain and f : U → ℂ be holomorphic. Show that f is analytic on U; that is, f has a Taylor series expansion around each point with radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity, and the series sums to f.

The following formal statement expresses a weakened version: on an open set U, a complex-differentiable function has, at each point z in U, a formal power series expansion (HasFPowerSeriesAt). We only assert the existence of a nonzero radius.

Statement (informal):
Let f : [a,b] → ℝ be a bounded function, {a_n} and {b_n} sequences with a < a_n < b_n < b, a_n → a, b_n → b.
Suppose f is Riemann integrable on [a_n,b_n] for all n. Then f is Riemann integrable on [a,b]
and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_{a_n}^{b_n} f.

This file gives a formal translation of the statement. Mathlib4 may use different names for the
Riemann integrability predicate; to avoid depending on specific library names we introduce
placeholder definitions `RiemannIntegrableOn` and `RiemannIntegral` and state the theorem using
`Tendsto` to express convergence of the integrals.
