",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, standard.
- Comment: states the intent: multiplication distributes over subtraction on the left in any ring.
- `theorem mul_sub_in_ring {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with a ring structure, and any elements a, b, c in R, we have a times (b minus c) equals a times b minus a times c. This is exactly left distributivity over subtraction. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
Original: ""Let R be a ring and let a,b,c∈R. Show that a(b−c) = ab − ac.""
Lean theorem states precisely that for any ring R and elements a, b, c, a*(b-c) = a*b - a*c. This is exactly the same statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Structures: Uses `[Ring R]`, matching “R is a ring”. Subtraction is permitted in a ring; fine.
- Variables: `a b c : R` matches `a,b,c∈R`.
- Equality: `a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c` matches `a(b-c) = ab - ac`.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions; only a single theorem. Using Mathlib-standard typeclass `Ring`.
No differences found. The translation is faithful.

theorem srdoty_neg_mul_eq_neg_mul (a b : R) : -a * b = -(a * b) := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib; fine.
- Docstring: states the goal: in any ring R we have a * -b = -(a * b) and -a * b = -(a * b). This matches the natural language statement.
- `variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]`: Introduces a type R with a ring structure. This matches “Let R be a ring.”
- `theorem srdoty_mul_neg_eq_neg_mul (a b : R) : a * -b = -(a * b) := by sorry`: States for all a b in R, a * (-b) = -(a * b). No proof provided (sorry), but the statement is exactly one part of the claim.
- `theorem srdoty_neg_mul_eq_neg_mul (a b : R) : -a * b = -(a * b) := by sorry`: States for all a b in R, (-a) * b = -(a * b). Again, no proof, but the statement is exactly the other part of the claim.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL: “Let R be a ring and let a,b ∈ R. Show that a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b.”
- The code provides two theorems: a * (-b) = -(a*b) and (-a) * b = -(a*b). From these, one immediately obtains the chain equality a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b. Thus the formal statements exactly capture the intended claim.

3) Final check for faithfulness and red flags:
- No auxiliary or vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced. Only standard `Ring R` is assumed.
- The statements are precise and standard in Mathlib’s language. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing, since we assess statements, not proofs.
- No mismatch in assumptions: a ring in Mathlib includes 1, which is standard and stronger than needed but not in conflict with the statement. The results do not require commutativity, and the code does not assume it.
- The combined equality is represented by two equalities to the same middle term, which is fully faithful to the NL chain equality.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: imports the Mathlib library; no mathematical content.
- `theorem srdoty_mul_zero {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a : R) : a * 0 = 0 := by sorry` translates to: For any type R with a ring structure and any element a in R, a multiplied by 0 equals 0.
- `theorem srdoty_zero_mul {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a : R) : 0 * a = 0 := by sorry` translates to: For any type R with a ring structure and any element a in R, 0 multiplied by a equals 0.

Assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""Let R be a ring and let a ∈ R. Show that a·0 = 0 = 0·a."" This requires proving two equalities: a·0 = 0 and 0·a = 0. The Lean code states exactly these two facts as separate theorems.
- The typeclass `[Ring R]` matches the ""R is a ring"" assumption. Using Ring (rather than Semiring) is consistent with the statement and not weaker; it is acceptable.
- There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; only theorem statements. The use of `sorry` indicates omitted proofs, which is acceptable for translation auditing per the instructions.

Final check:
- The two math problems are the same: the Lean code asserts both required equalities for arbitrary a in a ring R, which matches the natural language statement ""a·0 = 0 = 0·a"".
- No discrepancies found.

- def approx (a b : ℝ) : Prop := ∃ k : Int, a - b = k: Define a binary relation approx on ℝ by: a ≈ b iff there exists an integer k such that a − b = k. Here, k : Int is coerced to a real on the right-hand side of the equality, so this exactly means a − b is an integer.
- theorem approx_equivalence : Equivalence approx := by sorry: State that approx is an equivalence relation (i.e., reflexive, symmetric, transitive) on ℝ. No proof is provided, but the statement matches the requirement to prove it’s an equivalence relation.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement defines ≈ by a ≈ b iff a − b ∈ ℤ. The Lean definition uses ∃ k : Int, a − b = k, which is precisely the standard formalization of a real being an integer (i.e., lying in the image of Int → ℝ). Therefore, the definition matches exactly.
- The natural language statement asks to prove that ≈ is an equivalence relation on ℝ. The Lean theorem states Equivalence approx, which is the standard structure encoding reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity for a relation on ℝ. Thus, it matches the requested conclusion.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary vacuous placeholders are introduced. The only auxiliary definition (approx) is legitimate and faithful.
- The use of equality a − b = k with k : Int is equivalent to a − b ∈ ℤ.
- The theorem statement precisely asserts equivalence; there is no scope mismatch or domain change.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem `srdoty_alg_Z_n_607` takes `n : ℤ` with `n_pos : 0 < n` (so n is a fixed positive integer), and `a b c : ℤ` (integers). It assumes `hab : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]` and `hbc : b ≡ c [ZMOD n]`, where `[ZMOD n]` is Mathlib’s notation for integer congruence modulo n (Int.ModEq). The goal is to prove `a ≡ c [ZMOD n]` (transitivity of congruence modulo n).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a,b,c ∈ ℤ. If a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n). The Lean statement matches exactly: n is an integer with 0 < n, a,b,c are integers, and the hypotheses and conclusion are precisely the congruences modulo n. The notation `[ZMOD n]` is the standard Mathlib representation for congruence modulo an integer.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given (with proof omitted, which is fine for translation auditing).

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain and conditions match (n positive integer, a,b,c integers).
- Exact property stated (transitivity of ≡ mod n). No extra or missing hypotheses.
- Using ℤ for n is consistent with the phrase ""positive integer."" Everything aligns.

- The Lean theorem exactly matches: n is an integer with 0 < n (positive), a, b, c, d are integers, two congruence hypotheses are given, and the conclusion asserts the two resulting congruences. Using `Int.ModEq n` is the standard Mathlib formalization for congruence modulo an integer n. Representing n as a positive integer within ℤ (via `0 < n`) is a faithful formalization of “positive integer.”

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The hypotheses and conclusions correspond precisely to the natural language statement.
- The small formal difference (n typed as ℤ with `0 < n` rather than as ℕ) is standard and mathematically equivalent for this context.

- `theorem srdoty_mul_zero (a : R) : a * 0 = 0 := by sorry`

  Translation: For any a in R, (−1)a = −a. Matches exactly.

Global assessment:
- The Lean statements precisely reflect each of the natural language claims.

- Theorem statement: `theorem isField_iff_units_eq_nonzero (R : Type _) [CommRing R] : IsField R ↔ ({x : R | IsUnit x} = {x : R | x ≠ 0}) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a type R with a commutative ring structure, R is a field if and only if the set of elements of R that are units equals the set of nonzero elements of R.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: A commutative ring R is a field iff R^× = R \ {0}. Interpreting R^× as the subset of R consisting of units (not the separate type `Units R`), this is exactly `{x : R | IsUnit x}`. The right-hand side `R \ {0}` is represented as `{x : R | x ≠ 0}`. So the set equality in Lean matches the informal statement precisely.
- The predicate `IsField R` in Mathlib is the standard notion of field (commutative ring, nontrivial, every nonzero has a multiplicative inverse). This is the correct formalization of “R is a field.”
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; no vacuous defs appear. The use of `IsUnit` and set comprehension is standard and appropriate.
- Edge cases: In the zero ring, right side is false and left side is false; the equivalence remains correct. In fields, the equality holds since 0 is not a unit and every nonzero is a unit.

  Translation: For integers n, a, b with n > 0, a is congruent to b modulo n if and only if the remainder of a upon division by n equals the remainder of b upon division by n. Here, Int.ModEq n a b means a ≡ b (mod n) (the standard divisibility definition), and Int.emod a n is the integer remainder of a upon division by n (for n > 0, emod returns the unique r with 0 ≤ r < n satisfying a = qn + r).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The hypotheses match: n, a, b are integers; 0 < n is assumed.
- The conclusion matches exactly: a ≡ b (mod n) ↔ their remainders modulo n are equal. Using Int.emod for the remainder is the correct Mathlib notion for the remainder upon division by a positive integer n.

Assessment relative to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: ""Let n>1 be an integer. Prove that the linear congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) has a solution in Z_n whenever the class [a] ∈ Z_n is a unit.""
- Equality `a * x = b` in ZMod n is exactly the congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) at the level of residue classes. So the existence of x with `a * x = b` in ZMod n is the same as solvability of the congruence.
- Variables `a, b : ZMod n` match ""the class [a] in Z_n"" and b in Z_n. The hypothesis `IsUnit a` matches ""[a] is a unit"". The assumption `hn : 1 < n` corresponds to ""n > 1"". The conclusion `∃ x : ZMod n, a * x = b` matches ""has a solution in Z_n"".

- `theorem int_add_mod_eq {n : Int} (hn : 0 < n) {a b c d : Int} (h1 : Int.ModEq n a b) (h2 : Int.ModEq n c d) : Int.ModEq n (a + c) (b + d) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let n be an integer with 0 < n, and let a, b, c, d be integers. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod n). The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The original statement: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c, d in ℤ. Suppose a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n). Show a + c ≡ b + d (mod n).
- The Lean code uses Int for n and the elements, assumes 0 < n, and uses Int.ModEq to denote congruence modulo n. This matches exactly.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain and types: ℤ correspond to Int in Lean; modulus n is an Int with positive assumption, matching a positive integer.
- Hypotheses and conclusion match word-for-word in mathematical meaning.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the presence of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable since we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: G is a type with a group structure and is finite ([Group G], [Fintype G]). p is a natural number prime (hp : Nat.Prime p).
- Hypothesis h: for every g : G, there exists k : ℕ such that orderOf g = p ^ k. This matches “every element has order a power of a fixed prime p.”
- Additional hypothesis hne: Nontrivial G (there exist two distinct elements). This is explicitly stated in the docstring: “We assume G is nontrivial.”
- Conclusion: there exists r : ℕ such that 1 ≤ r and Fintype.card G = p ^ r. This matches “|G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.” Using ℕ instead of ℤ for r is fine since r ≥ 1.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “If G is a finite group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime p, then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.” No explicit nontrivial requirement appears among the hypotheses; the condition r ≥ 1 is in the conclusion.
- The Lean theorem adds an extra hypothesis (Nontrivial G). This strengthens the assumptions relative to the NL statement. As written, the NL statement applies to all finite groups with the property, including the trivial group. For the trivial group (|G| = 1), every element indeed has order a power of p (the identity has order 1 = p^0), but the conclusion “|G| = p^r with r ≥ 1” is false. So the NL statement is only correct if one implicitly excludes the trivial group or changes the conclusion to r ≥ 0.
- Therefore, the Lean code does not literally translate the given statement; it modifies it by adding Nontrivial G to make r ≥ 1 consistent. Everything else matches faithfully (finite group, prime p, element orders are exact powers p^k, conclusion is |G| = p^r with r ≥ 1).

Final check:
- Same? Not exactly: the Lean code assumes Nontrivial G; the NL statement does not. This is a genuine difference in hypotheses, although it aligns with the intended conclusion r ≥ 1.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no misuse of Mathlib.

Given the instruction to be extra harsh, this mismatch means the translation is not fully faithful, though it is very close.

The `Nonempty (G ≃+ ...)` expresses existence of an isomorphism. The condition `0 < n i` avoids the degenerate ZMod 0 case. This matches the statement “Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups.”

- `theorem count_iso_classes_of_order (n : ℕ) : 1 = 1 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n, 1 = 1. This is a completely unrelated tautology and does not state anything about the number of isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order n, nor about prime power factorizations or partition numbers.

Faithfulness assessment:
- First part: The code’s first theorem is a faithful formalization of the first sentence of the natural language statement, using standard Mathlib notions (AddCommGroup, Fintype, ZMod, Pi-type as finite direct product). Minor nuances (allowing factors of order 1) are acceptable since the trivial group is cyclic, and the existence claim is still correct.
- Second part: The code utterly fails to state the counting result. Instead of formalizing the statement about the number of isomorphism classes in terms of the prime power factorization n = ∏ p_i^{k_i} and the partition function p(k), it gives the trivial identity 1 = 1 with a comment acknowledging a placeholder. This is not a faithful translation of the second sentence.

Final check:
- The full natural language statement has two parts. The code captures only the first part correctly and replaces the second part with an unrelated tautology. Therefore, the overall translation is not faithful.

  This declares (without providing the proof) an additive group isomorphism between ZMod m × ZMod n and ZMod (m * n), under the hypotheses that m, n are natural numbers with m ≥ 1, n ≥ 1, and m and n are coprime (Nat.coprime, i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1). The symbol `≃+` denotes an additive group equivalence. `ZMod k` denotes the integers modulo k, which as an additive group is the cyclic group of order k when k ≥ 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For integers m, n ≥ 1 with gcd(m, n) = 1, one has Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}.
- The Lean statement precisely asserts an additive group isomorphism (≃+) between ZMod m × ZMod n and ZMod (m * n) under the same hypotheses. This matches the conventional interpretation of Z_m as the cyclic group of order m (i.e., the additive group of Z/mZ). The use of Nat for m, n with constraints 1 ≤ m, 1 ≤ n matches “integers ≥ 1.” Direction of isomorphism is immaterial since isomorphisms are symmetric.

3) Final check for differences:
- Group vs ring isomorphism: The code asserts an additive group isomorphism, which is exactly what the statement typically means by Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}. The statement does not explicitly require a ring isomorphism, so this is appropriate and faithful.
- Quantifiers and hypotheses: m, n ≥ 1 and gcd(m, n)=1 are present and correctly encoded as `1 ≤ m`, `1 ≤ n`, `Coprime m n`.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; `sorry` is used only to omit the proof, which is acceptable per the instructions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem subgroups_eq_zmultiples (H : AddSubgroup ℤ) : ∃ n : ℕ, H = AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` states: For any additive subgroup H of the integers, there exists a natural number n such that H equals the additive subgroup of ℤ consisting of all integer multiples of n (i.e., nℤ). Here `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` is Mathlib's standard notion of the subgroup generated by an element n in an additive group, which in ℤ is precisely nℤ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: “The subgroups of (ℤ, +) are exactly the subgroups nℤ for integers n.” The Lean statement says: For every subgroup H ≤ ℤ, there exists n ∈ ℕ with H = nℤ. This is a standard normalization of the classification: since nℤ = (−n)ℤ, the collection {nℤ | n ∈ ℤ} coincides with {nℤ | n ∈ ℕ}. Thus existential quantification over ℕ is logically equivalent to existential quantification over ℤ for this classification. Moreover, `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` is by definition a subgroup, so the “exactly” (both directions) is respected: the right-hand side is indeed a subgroup, and the theorem asserts every subgroup arises this way.

3) Final check:
- Differences: The code uses n : ℕ instead of n : ℤ. This is an equivalent formulation because nℤ = (|n|)ℤ and conversely any ℕ is an ℤ. No other discrepancies. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; it uses Mathlib’s standard `AddSubgroup.zmultiples`.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Function`: Brings in Mathlib and opens the Function namespace (unused here).
- Docstring: States the goal: For a ring R and a ∈ R, show (-1)a = -a.
- `theorem neg_one_mul_extracted [MulOneClass R] [HasDistribNeg R] (a : R) : -1 * a = -a := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R equipped with a `MulOneClass` (i.e., has a multiplication and a multiplicative identity 1) and `HasDistribNeg` (a class providing negation and its distributivity over addition), and any element a : R, we have (-1) * a = -a. No proof is provided (sorry placeholder).

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The original statement explicitly assumes R is a ring. In Mathlib, that would typically be `[Ring R]` (or a closely related ring-like structure such as `[Semiring R]` plus negation etc.).
- The Lean theorem does not assume `[Ring R]`. Instead it assumes `[MulOneClass R]` and `[HasDistribNeg R]`. This is both nonstandard and mismatched:
  - It is a generalization beyond rings (so it is stronger than the requested statement), which is not logically equivalent to the original.
  - Moreover, these assumptions are likely insufficient to even formulate the usual algebraic facts that justify the equality (they do not assert any interaction between multiplication and addition, e.g., distributivity of multiplication over addition), though for this audit we only check the statement, not the proof. Still, this mismatch in structure is a red flag for faithfulness.
- The statement in the code is the equality (-1) * a = -a for the given structure. The equality itself matches the natural language target, but the context/assumptions do not match “R is a ring.”

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Original: For a ring R, show (-1)a = -a.
- Code: For any R with `MulOneClass` and `HasDistribNeg`, show (-1) * a = -a.
Differences:
- Structural assumptions differ: ring vs. `MulOneClass` + `HasDistribNeg`. This is a generalization and not logically equivalent. The original specifically requires a ring, while the code asserts the statement in a potentially broader and ill-specified setting.
- Minor technical concern: The code does not explicitly declare the type parameter `R : Type _`; although Lean can sometimes infer binders, this is nonstandard and may not compile as-is in a strict setting. Even if it compiles, the mismatch of structures remains the main issue.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it does not state the theorem under the same assumptions (ring). It overgeneralizes and uses atypical typeclasses rather than `[Ring R]` (or a standard ring-like structure). No vacuous definitions are present, but the mismatch in assumptions means it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library.
- `theorem zmod_isField_iff_prime (n : ℕ) : IsField (ZMod n) ↔ Nat.Prime n := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n, the ring of integers modulo n, ZMod n, is a field if and only if n is a prime number.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Original statement: “Let n be a positive integer. Then Z_n is a field if and only if n is a prime number.”
- Lean statement: “For all n ∈ ℕ, IsField (ZMod n) ↔ Nat.Prime n.”

Key differences:
- The original restricts n to be a positive integer (n > 0). The Lean statement quantifies over all natural numbers, including n = 0 (and also n = 1). 
- Despite this, the equivalence actually still holds for n = 0 and n = 1, since ZMod 0 ≃ ℤ (not a field) and ZMod 1 is the trivial ring (not a field), and neither 0 nor 1 is prime. Thus the Lean statement is strictly stronger but remains true and implies the original statement.

Step 3: Final check
- Concepts used are standard Mathlib ones: ZMod n for ℤ/nℤ and IsField/Nat.Prime. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only mismatch is the domain quantification: the Lean code states the equivalence for all n : ℕ rather than restricting to positive integers. Being extra harsh, this is a deviation from the stated domain, even though it does not change the truth value for the disallowed cases and in fact strengthens the statement.

Conclusion: The translation is very close but not exactly faithful due to the missing “n > 0” restriction. Everything else matches perfectly.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Equiv.Perm (Fin n) is the standard Lean/mathlib representation of the symmetric group S_n.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The first line matches the first sentence: “Two permutations in S_n are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type.” In mathlib, Perm.cycleType is a multiset of cycle lengths excluding 1-cycles, but in S_n this still characterizes conjugacy classes because the number of fixed points is determined by n minus the sum of the cycle lengths. So this is acceptable and faithful.

- The second and third lines attempt to formalize: “the partitions of n label the conjugacy classes of S_n” and “the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of partitions of n.” However, the chosen target { m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n } is not the standard notion of partitions of n. Partitions of n require all parts to be positive (≥ 1). The subtype used here allows zeros in the multiset. Since Multiset ℕ is finite but allows arbitrary multiplicities of 0, one can have infinitely many distinct multisets with sum n by adding any number of zeros; therefore, this set is strictly larger than the set of partitions and has a different (indeed infinite) cardinality. Hence, these two Lean statements are not faithful to the claim about partitions labeling conjugacy classes nor to the counting statement.

- Additionally, mathlib already has a notion of “partitions of n” (via a dedicated partition type in combinatorics), or at least the Lean code should have enforced the positivity constraint (∀ a ∈ m, 0 < a) alongside m.sum = n to represent partitions correctly. The absence of this constraint is a critical mismatch.

3) Final check:
- The first theorem is faithful.
- The equivalence and counting statements are not faithful because they use all multisets summing to n (allowing zeros) instead of partitions (positive parts only). This materially changes the mathematical meaning and would make the cardinalities incorrect.

Conclusion: Overall, the translation fails due to the incorrect target for partitions in the second and third statements.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is parameterized by a type R and two binary operations add mul : R → R → R.
- It asserts an equivalence: (Nonempty (Ring R)) ↔ (Nonempty (AddCommGroup R) ∧ Nonempty (Monoid R) ∧ distributivity expressed using the explicit functions add and mul).
- More explicitly:
  • Left side: There exists at least one Ring structure on R (i.e., some choice of +, *, 0, 1, − making ring axioms true).
  • Right side: There exists at least one AddCommGroup structure on R (with its own + and 0), and at least one Monoid structure on R (with its own * and 1), and, in addition, the given functions add and mul satisfy left and right distributivity: ∀ a b c, mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c) ∧ mul (add b c) a = add (mul b a) (mul c a).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement fixes a set R equipped with specific binary operations + and ·, and claims: R is a ring (with respect to these fixed operations) if and only if (R,+) is an abelian group with identity 0, (R,·) is a monoid with identity 1, and both distributive laws hold for these same operations.
- The Lean statement fails to tie the Ring structure on the left to the provided add and mul. It merely says “there exists some Ring structure on R,” possibly with completely different operations than add and mul.
- On the right side, it also fails to tie the AddCommGroup and Monoid structures to add and mul. The distributive laws use the explicit functions add and mul, but the AddCommGroup and Monoid quantifications refer to potentially different, unrelated operations (the ones inside those instances). There is no compatibility constraint stating that the addition of the AddCommGroup equals add, nor that the multiplication of the Monoid equals mul, nor that the 0 and 1 from those structures are the identities corresponding to add and mul.
- Therefore, the RHS is a conjunction of three unrelated facts: existence of some additive commutative group structure on R, existence of some monoid structure on R, and distributivity for a possibly unrelated pair of functions add and mul. This does not express the intended single pair of operations satisfying all three conditions.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The original requires an equivalence about a single fixed pair of operations (+, ·) on R. The Lean code quantifies existence of possibly unrelated instances and does not enforce that the operations in the ring, the additive group, and the monoid coincide with the given add and mul. This is a fundamental mismatch.
- Ancillary notes: Using Monoid (not CommutativeMonoid) for multiplication is fine for a (not-necessarily-commutative) ring. The identities 0 and 1 are implicitly contained in AddCommGroup and Monoid, respectively, which is correct, but again they are not tied to add and mul.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it fails to identify the ring/additive group/monoid operations with the given add and mul.

- theorem zmod_units_eq_coprime {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n) : {a : ZMod n | IsUnit a} = { a : ZMod n | ∃ m : ℕ, a = (m : ZMod n) ∧ Nat.Coprime m n } := by sorry
  Natural language: For a positive integer n, the set of units in Z/nZ equals the set of residue classes that admit a natural number representative m coprime to n. This is a faithful rendering of { [a] in Z_n : gcd(a, n) = 1 }. The use of ∃ m is appropriate since every class has representatives in ℕ and the coprimality condition is invariant under adding multiples of n.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions: ZMod n for Z/nZ, IsUnit for units in a ring, and Nat.Coprime for gcd(a, n) = 1. No nonstandard or placeholder definitions are introduced. There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions.
- The hypothesis hn : 0 < n matches the natural language “Let n be a positive integer.”
- The first theorem precisely states the iff between being a unit and being coprime with n for the class [a]. Using a : ℕ is fine, as [a] denotes the class of a mod n and coprimality is invariant under congruence modulo n.
- The second theorem states the equality of the set of units with the set of classes with a coprime representative, which matches the natural language description of Z_n^× = { [a] : gcd(a, n) = 1 }.

Final check:
- The mathematical content and quantification match exactly. No extra or missing hypotheses beyond n > 0. The choice to express the right-hand set via an existential natural representative is equivalent to the usual set-builder notation and is faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code into natural language:
- `theorem inter_is_trivial_of_coprime {G : Type _} [Group G] {H K : Subgroup G} {m n : ℕ}`: Let G be a group, H and K subgroups of G, and m, n natural numbers.
- `(hH : Fintype H) (hK : Fintype K)`: Assume H and K are finite (as types of subgroup elements), i.e., finite subgroups.
- `(hcardH : Fintype.card H = m) (hcardK : Fintype.card K = n)`: The orders (cardinalities) of H and K are m and n respectively.
- `(hmn : Nat.Coprime m n)`: Assume m and n are coprime (gcd(m, n) = 1).
- Conclusion: `: (H ⊓ K) = ⊥`: Then the intersection subgroup H ∩ K is the trivial subgroup (i.e., {1}). Here `⊓` is the meet (intersection) of subgroups and `⊥` is the trivial subgroup {1}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original states: Let H and K be finite subgroups of a group G with |H| = m and |K| = n. If gcd(m, n) = 1, then H ∩ K = {1}.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes finiteness via `Fintype` instances, fixes the numerical orders as `Fintype.card H = m` and `Fintype.card K = n`, assumes `Nat.Coprime m n`, and concludes `(H ⊓ K) = ⊥`, which is the standard Lean encoding of “H ∩ K = {1}”.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Using `⊥` for {1} and `⊓` for intersection is standard in Mathlib for subgroups.
- The inclusion of `hcardH` and `hcardK` aligns with the natural language’s specification of |H| = m and |K| = n.
- There are no extraneous hypotheses or missing assumptions.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib.
- Theorem name and docstring: States the goal matching the natural language: for n ≥ 6 and N a proper normal subgroup of A_n, then N contains each point stabilizer G_i = {σ ∈ A_n | σ i = i}.
- Parameters:
  - n : ℕ, hn : 6 ≤ n: n ≥ 6.
  - N : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)): N is a subgroup of the full symmetric group S_n on n letters (represented as permutations of Fin n).
  - hN_normal : ∀ g x, x ∈ N → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N: N is normal in S_n (conjugation by any permutation g ∈ S_n keeps you in N).
  - hN_proper : N ≠ MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) →* _): N is not equal to ker(sign), i.e., not equal to the alternating group A_n.
- Conclusion:
  - ∀ (i : Fin n) (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), σ ∈ MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) →* _) → σ i = i → σ ∈ N: For every i and every even permutation σ (σ ∈ A_n) fixing i, we have σ ∈ N. Equivalently, G_i ≤ N for every i.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let n ≥ 6 and let N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n. Show that N contains every subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i} for each i.

Issues:
- Ambient group and normality:
  - Original: N is a normal subgroup of A_n (normality under conjugation by elements of A_n).
  - Lean: N is assumed normal in S_n (conjugation by all g ∈ S_n), a strictly stronger assumption.
- Properness relative to A_n:
  - Original: N is a proper subgroup of A_n, i.e., N ≤ A_n and N ≠ A_n.
  - Lean: Only N ≠ A_n is assumed; there is no assumption that N ⊆ A_n. Thus N might not be a subgroup of A_n at all (e.g., N could be S_n itself, which the code allows and which is normal in S_n and ≠ A_n).
- Conclusion:
  - Both conclude that every point stabilizer in A_n is contained in N. The Lean statement encodes ""G_i ≤ N"" as: ∀σ ∈ A_n fixing i, σ ∈ N, which is correct.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem proves a different statement: it assumes N is a subgroup of S_n that is normal in S_n and not equal to A_n, and then concludes N contains each A_n-point-stabilizer. The original requires N to be a proper normal subgroup of A_n (so N ≤ A_n and normality is only with respect to A_n). The Lean code omits the crucial assumption N ≤ A_n and strengthens normality to normal in S_n. These are not logically equivalent to the original assumptions and thus the translation is not faithful.

Other checks:
- No vacuous placeholder definitions: Uses Mathlib's ker(sign) to represent A_n, which is legitimate.
- The conclusion is correctly phrased in terms of membership in ker(sign) and fixing i.

Grade rationale:
- The conclusion matches the intended claim, but the hypotheses are materially different: N is not required to be a subgroup of A_n and normality is in S_n rather than A_n. This is a significant mismatch in the statement's meaning. No vacuous definitions are used. Therefore, not faithful; assign a mid-high score reflecting the close but incorrect translation.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Context: `import Mathlib` pulls in Mathlib. Variables: `{G : Type*} [Group G] {p : ℕ} [Fact (Nat.Prime p)]` means G is a group and p is a prime.
- Hypothesis: `[Unique (Sylow p G)]` states there is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup of G (expressed via a Unique instance on the type of Sylow p-subgroups).
- Statement: `Subgroup.normalizer ((default : Sylow p G) : Subgroup G) = (⊤ : Subgroup G)` says the normalizer in G of the unique Sylow p-subgroup (chosen as `default` via the Unique instance and coerced to a `Subgroup G`) is the whole group. This is equivalent to saying that subgroup is normal in G.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If G is a finite group with exactly one Sylow p-subgroup, then that Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.
- Lean: If G is a group with exactly one Sylow p-subgroup, then that Sylow p-subgroup is normal (expressed as its normalizer equals ⊤).
- The use of `[Unique (Sylow p G)]` faithfully captures “exactly one Sylow p-subgroup.” The conclusion via normalizer equal to top is a standard equivalent formulation of normality.

Step 3: Differences and issues.
- Finiteness: The natural language statement explicitly assumes G is finite. The Lean statement does not add an explicit finiteness assumption. In Mathlib, `Sylow p G` is defined in general (as maximal p-subgroups), so the Lean theorem is a (slight) generalization: it asserts the same conclusion under the precise hypothesis “there is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup,” without separately assuming finiteness. This does not weaken the statement; it is stronger or at least as strong as the finite case. Given the prompt’s strictness, this is a mild mismatch but not a change in mathematical content vis-à-vis the core implication “uniqueness of Sylow p-subgroup implies normal.”
- Conclusion phrasing: The code uses `normalizer H = ⊤` instead of explicitly stating `H` is normal; these are equivalent in group theory. So this is faithful.
- Minor docstring wording issue: It says “equals its normalizer, i.e. is normal,” which is inaccurate; the theorem actually says the normalizer equals ⊤, which is the correct normality criterion. This does not affect the theorem statement itself.

Final check: The math problems are essentially the same. The Lean statement captures exactly the intended implication about uniqueness of a Sylow p-subgroup implying normality, with a slightly more general scope (no explicit finiteness assumption). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem srdoty_alg_Sylow_421 is stated for a finite group G and a natural number p with hypotheses:
  • hp : p.Prime
  • hp_ne_two : p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime)
  • hcard : Fintype.card G = 2 * p (|G| = 2p)
- Conclusion: Either
  • Nonempty (G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod (2 * p)))
    meaning G is isomorphic (as a group) to the multiplicative version of ZMod (2p), i.e., the cyclic group of order 2p; or
  • there exists a monoid homomorphism φ : Multiplicative (ZMod 2) →* MulAut (Multiplicative (ZMod p)) such that
    Nonempty (G ≃* SemidirectProduct (Multiplicative (ZMod p)) (Multiplicative (ZMod 2)) φ),
    i.e., G is isomorphic to a semidirect product C_p ⋊_φ C_2 for some action φ of C_2 on C_p by automorphisms.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: If |G| = 2p with p an odd prime, then G ≅ Z_{2p} or D_p.
- The Lean statement offers: G is either cyclic of order 2p or is isomorphic to some semidirect product C_p ⋊ C_2 (for some φ). For p odd, Aut(C_p) ≅ (Z/pZ)× is cyclic of order p − 1, hence any hom C_2 → Aut(C_p) is either trivial or sends the generator of C_2 to the unique element of order 2 (which is x ↦ x⁻¹). Therefore, up to isomorphism, the semidirect products C_p ⋊ C_2 are exactly the direct product C_p × C_2 (trivial action, which is cyclic of order 2p since p is odd) and the dihedral group D_p (nontrivial action by inversion). Since the left disjunct already covers the cyclic case, the right disjunct precisely captures the dihedral case up to isomorphism. Thus, the Lean statement is logically equivalent to “G ≅ Z_{2p} or G ≅ D_p.”

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not name D_p explicitly; it uses the general semidirect product C_p ⋊ C_2 with an unspecified action φ. However, in the setting p odd prime, the only nontrivial such action produces the dihedral group, and the trivial action reproduces the cyclic group already covered by the first disjunct. Hence the theorem statement is equivalent to the original classification.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all objects are standard Mathlib concepts (ZMod, Multiplicative, MulAut, SemidirectProduct), and the assumptions correctly encode “p odd prime” and “|G| = 2p.”
- Minor stylistic mismatch: the statement doesn’t use a DihedralGroup definition by name, but it encodes an equivalent characterization via semidirect products.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful in mathematical meaning (logical equivalence holds in this context). The only minor deviation is not naming D_p explicitly.

The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement: For any positive integer n, if A is an n×n matrix and B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, then B = U A, where U is the corresponding n×n elementary matrix of the same type.
- The Lean theorem shape (assuming proper definitions) roughly matches the intended mathematical content: for n > 0, A, B n×n, if B results from a single row op on A, then there exists an elementary matrix U with B = U * A.
- However, the code uses two vacuous placeholder predicates (both defined as True). This makes the hypothesis and the property of U meaningless, so the statement is not a faithful formalization.
- The code does not encode the phrase “the corresponding elementary matrix of the same type”; it merely asserts existence of some elementary U, not necessarily the one corresponding to the exact operation type (swap, scale by a unit, or row addition). Even if the placeholders were replaced by real definitions, the theorem would still only assert existence, not the correspondence to the specific type. While existence is a common formalization of this fact, the original statement emphasizes the exact correspondence to the operation performed.
- The code works over a Semiring, which could be acceptable if “elementary row operation” is defined to include only operations valid in R (e.g., scaling by a unit). But the placeholders prevent verifying this subtlety.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No, due to vacuous definitions: obtained_by_single_row_op and elementary_matrix are True, so the statement reduces to “if True then ∃ U, True ∧ B = U * A,” which is not the intended content.
- Missing specificity: it does not guarantee U is of the same type as the row operation that produced B from A.
- The use of Semiring instead of Ring/Field is not necessarily wrong, but without a proper definition of elementary operations it is unclear whether the domain matches the intended statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it relies on vacuous placeholder predicates and omits the “same type” correspondence. If the placeholders were replaced with proper mathlib concepts and the theorem merely stated existence, it would be close to faithful; however, as written, it fails the strict criteria.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Set up Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace. OK.
- `variable {n : Nat}`: Fix a natural number n. Interpreted as the matrix size parameter. OK.
- `def is_elementary_matrix (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real) : Prop := True`: Defines a predicate ""M is an elementary matrix"" but as the trivially true proposition. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the real notion of an elementary matrix (row swaps, nonzero row scaling, row addition). Red flag per the guidelines.
- The theorem statement:

  Natural language: For any n×n real matrix A with nonzero determinant (i.e., nonsingular), there exists a finite list E of n×n real matrices such that every matrix in E is elementary and the product (List.prod, i.e., matrix multiplication of the list in order, with the identity as the empty product) equals A. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- The quantification over nonsingular n×n real matrices A matches the natural language hypothesis (det A ≠ 0 expresses nonsingularity over ℝ).
- The conclusion matches the intended claim: A is a product of elementary matrices.
- However, the crucial notion ""elementary matrix"" is encoded by a placeholder predicate defined as `True`. This makes the theorem statement vacuous regarding the actual content about elementary matrices; it would assert the existence of any list E with E.prod = A, since the predicate imposes no restriction. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be faithful and non-vacuous.
- No other suspicious auxiliary definitions are introduced, but the single placeholder already breaks faithfulness.
Additional minor observations:
- The use of Real aligns with the statement.
- Allowing an empty list E would give the identity matrix as a product of zero elementary matrices; this is standard and not an issue.
- Edge case n = 0 is not addressed in the natural language, but not critical here.
Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code’s theorem uses a vacuous definition of ""elementary matrix"", so it does not faithfully capture the intended property. If the placeholder were replaced by a proper Mathlib-level definition of elementary matrices, the theorem statement would be faithful.
Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definition makes the translation not faithful (faithful_score = 0). If that definition were repaired, the final theorem statement would match the natural language well, so a grade of 6 is appropriate per the rubric.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The code defines a predicate `is_field (F add mul zero one)` consisting of a conjunction of nine axioms:
  1) `∀ a b, add a b = add b a`: addition is commutative.
  2) `∀ a b c, add (add a b) c = add a (add b c)`: addition is associative.
  3) `∀ a, add a zero = a`: zero is a right additive identity.
  4) `∀ a, ∃ b, add a b = zero`: every element has a right additive inverse.
  5) `∀ a b, mul a b = mul b a`: multiplication is commutative.
  6) `∀ a, mul a one = a`: one is a right multiplicative identity.
  7) `one ≠ zero`: one is not zero.
  8) `∀ a, a ≠ zero → ∃ b, mul a b = one`: every nonzero element has a right multiplicative inverse.
  9) `∀ a b c, mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c)`: left distributivity.
- The theorem `is_field_iff_axioms` simply states `is_field F add mul zero one ↔ (the same nine axioms)`. This is a tautology given how `is_field` was defined.

Step 2: Comparison to the natural language statement
The natural language statement says: F is a field iff (1) (F,+) is an abelian group with identity 0; (2) (F\{0},·) is an abelian group with identity 1; (3) 1 ≠ 0; and (4) a(b+c)=ab+ac.

Key mismatches:
- The code does not use the standard Mathlib notion of a field (e.g., the `Field` typeclass or `IsField`). Instead, it defines its own `is_field` as exactly the conjunction of axioms it later restates, making the equivalence trivial. This fails to capture the intended equivalence between the standard concept of a field and the listed axioms.
- Crucially, the code omits multiplicative associativity entirely. A field requires that (F\{0}, ·) be an abelian group, which includes associativity of multiplication; this is missing.
- The code encodes only right identities and right inverses for both addition and multiplication. While commutativity of addition recovers left identity/inverses for addition, and commutativity of multiplication recovers the left identity/inverse if right ones exist, the absence of multiplicative associativity remains a fatal omission for the group structure.
- The code does not encode that (F\{0}, ·) is a group as a structure; it only asserts that each nonzero element has a right inverse in F. It does not assert closure of multiplication on nonzero elements (i.e., a,b ≠ 0 ⇒ ab ≠ 0), which is part of the group structure on F\{0} (and in the field setting follows from standard ring axioms). Without associativity and appropriate structure, this does not match (2).
- The code provides only left distributivity; right distributivity can be derived from left distributivity and commutativity of multiplication, so that part is acceptable. But again, missing multiplicative associativity is not.

Step 3: Final check: are the two statements the same?
No. The Lean code does not state “F is a field” in the standard sense; it replaces “field” by a custom predicate missing multiplicative associativity and the explicit group structure on F\{0}. The theorem restates the same predicate, so it is tautological rather than the intended equivalence with the standard definition of a field. It also fails to use Mathlib’s existing `Field` machinery, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

theorem test_true : True := by trivial
",0,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: Introduce a type `n` with the structure of a finite type and decidable equality. This is an abstract finite index type, not the natural number `n` representing a matrix dimension.
- `theorem test_true : True := by trivial`: State and prove the tautology `True`.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the natural language statement.
The natural language statement sets up a context in real linear algebra: A ∈ O(n) (the orthogonal group), viewing A as an n×n real matrix with columns A_i ∈ ℝ^n, and then says “Prove the following.” Even though the final target claim is omitted, the setup clearly involves:
- The orthogonal group O(n) over ℝ,
- Matrices of size n×n,
- Column vectors in ℝ^n.

The Lean code:
- Does not mention ℝ, matrices, vectors, or orthogonality.
- Uses `n` as a type (an index set), not as a natural number dimension.
- States only `True` and proves it, which is entirely unrelated to the orthogonal group setup.

Thus the code does not translate the setup, nor any plausible follow-up statement. It is completely unrelated to the mathematical content.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code proves a trivial tautology and contains no content about O(n), matrices, or ℝ^n. It fails to capture any part of the natural language setup.

No auxiliary definitions are present, but the final theorem is vacuous relative to the intended topic.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat`: standard imports and namespace opening; fine.
- Docstring: States the classical classification: there is a primitive root in ZMod n (equivalently the unit group is cyclic) iff n = 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t for an odd prime p and t ≥ 1. This matches the natural language statement and explicitly mentions t ≥ 1.
- Theorem statement:
  `theorem zmod_units_cyclic_iff {n : ℕ} : IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ) ↔ n = 2 ∨ n = 4 ∨ ∃ (p t : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ (n = p ^ t ∨ n = 2 * p ^ t)`
  Natural language translation: For any natural n, the unit group (ZMod n)ˣ is cyclic if and only if n = 2 or n = 4 or there exist natural numbers p and t such that p is prime, p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime), and n equals p^t or 2 * p^t.

2) Compare with the original statement:
- The English statement: There is a primitive root in Z_n^× iff n = 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t, where p is an odd prime. Standardly, t ≥ 1 is intended.
- Equivalence “primitive root exists” ↔ “(ZMod n)ˣ is cyclic”: correct.
- “p is an odd prime” ↔ `Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2`: correct.
- Critical mismatch: The theorem does not impose t ≥ 1. It quantifies over all t : ℕ. This allows t = 0, hence includes n = p^0 = 1 and n = 2 * p^0 = 2 inside the existential clause. The case n = 1 is not listed in the natural language statement (and the standard classification excludes it unless one explicitly allows the trivial case). The docstring explicitly says t ≥ 1, but the theorem statement omits this constraint.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- Difference: Missing condition t ≥ 1 in the Lean theorem. This makes the right side true for n = 1 (taking any odd prime p and t = 0), which is not included in the English list. While the trivial group is cyclic (so the left side holds for n = 1), the English statement enumerates only 2, 4, p^t, 2 p^t with the conventional understanding t ≥ 1 and does not include n = 1. Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation.
- All other aspects (use of (ZMod n)ˣ, equivalence to cyclic, “odd prime” vs “p ≠ 2”) are faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to omission of t ≥ 1, which changes the set of n allowed (adds n = 1). No vacuous placeholder definitions were used otherwise. Grade reflects an almost-correct statement with a key missing constraint.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and declares two theorems (with proofs omitted via `sorry`). There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.

1) `theorem infinite_cyclic_group_isomorphic_Z {G : Type _} [Group G] [IsCyclic G] (h : Infinite G) : Nonempty (MulEquiv G (Multiplicative ℤ))`
- For any type G with a group structure, assuming G is cyclic (`[IsCyclic G]`) and infinite (`Infinite G`), there exists a group isomorphism (`MulEquiv`) between G and `Multiplicative ℤ`.
- `Multiplicative ℤ` is the multiplicative incarnation of the additive group of integers ℤ. Thus this states: any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic (as a group) to ℤ, up to the conventional additive/multiplicative notation switch.

2) `theorem finite_cyclic_group_isomorphic_Zn {G : Type _} [Group G] [IsCyclic G] [Fintype G] : ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ Nonempty (MulEquiv G (Multiplicative (ZMod n)))`
- For any type G with a group structure, assuming G is cyclic and finite (`[Fintype G]`), there exists a positive natural number n and a group isomorphism between G and `Multiplicative (ZMod n)`.
- `ZMod n` is the additive group of integers modulo n (with additional ring structure), and `Multiplicative` turns that additive group into a multiplicative group for the isomorphism. The condition `0 < n` matches the natural-language stipulation “for some positive integer n.”

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The first theorem exactly captures “Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ,” expressed in multiplicative notation via `Multiplicative ℤ` and `MulEquiv` (a standard, faithful convention in Mathlib).
- The second theorem exactly captures “Any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ_n for some positive integer n,” using `ZMod n` as ℤ/nℤ and again translating additive-to-multiplicative via `Multiplicative`.
- The existence quantifiers and positivity condition match the statement. The use of `MulEquiv` correctly expresses group isomorphism. No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib objects (`Group`, `IsCyclic`, `Infinite`, `Fintype`, `MulEquiv`, `Multiplicative`, `ZMod`).

Final check:
- The two math statements are the same up to the conventional additive/multiplicative notation change, which is explicitly acknowledged in the code comments. There are no discrepancies in hypotheses or conclusions. This is a faithful translation.

- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Setup for matrices and notation.
- def O (n) : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := { A | A * Aᵀ = 1 }.
  This defines O(n) as the set of real n×n matrices whose product with their transpose equals the identity matrix.
- def GL_set (n) : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := { A | IsUnit A }.
  This defines GL_set(n) as the set of invertible (unit) n×n real matrices, i.e., the usual GL(n) viewed as a set.
- theorem O_eq_GL_set_inter (n) : O n = { A | A ∈ GL_set n ∧ A * Aᵀ = 1 } := by sorry.
  This asserts that O(n) equals the set of matrices that are both invertible and satisfy A Aᵀ = I.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Prove that O(n) = {A in GL(n): A A^T = I}.
- The Lean code defines O(n) as {A | A Aᵀ = I}. It defines GL(n) as the set of units (invertible matrices). The theorem then states exactly that O(n) equals {A | A ∈ GL(n) ∧ A Aᵀ = I}. This matches the NL statement precisely.
- Although the code uses a set of units rather than the Mathlib group type GL(n), as a set this is exactly the intended meaning of GL(n). The definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders), and the equality is the exact claim.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. No differences in mathematical meaning: same field (ℝ), same matrix size, same condition (A Aᵀ = I), same characterization via invertibility, and the equality of sets is exactly what the NL statement asks to prove.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Equiv Equiv.Perm Subgroup: Bring in Mathlib and open notation for permutations and subgroups.
- The docstring states the intended natural language theorem: Let n ≥ 6 and N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n. For fixed i, let G_i be the subgroup of A_n fixing i. Show N contains G_i.
- theorem subgroup_fixing_point_subset_of_normal {n : ℕ} (N : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n))) [N.Normal] (i : Fin n) (hN : N ≤ alternatingGroup (Fin n)) : (Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n))) ⊆ N := by sorry
  Natural language reading of the formal statement:
  • For an arbitrary natural number n, let N be a subgroup of S_n = Perm (Fin n) that is normal in S_n ([N.Normal]). Let i be an element of Fin n. Assume additionally that N ≤ A_n (expressed by hN : N ≤ alternatingGroup (Fin n)). Then the set Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n)) is contained in N.
  Notes on terminology/objects used:
  • [N.Normal] means N is normal in the ambient group Perm (Fin n) = S_n, not normal in A_n.
  • hN : N ≤ alternatingGroup (Fin n) asserts that N is contained in A_n as a subgroup of S_n.
  • The left-hand side (Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n))) is intended to denote the subgroup of permutations fixing i, but the identifier looks incorrect/nonstandard in Mathlib. Moreover, it coerces i : Fin n to a permutation (i : Perm (Fin n)), which is type-incorrect. In Mathlib, the point stabilizer is usually Equiv.Perm.stabilizer i (a Subgroup (Perm (Fin n))). The chosen name strongly suggests a misunderstanding, and likely does not compile.
  • The relation ⊆ is a subset relation on sets. Subgroups coerce to sets, so writing ⊆ between a set and N (as a subgroup coerced to a set) is typewise okay, but the mathematical object on the LHS is unclear.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Missing hypotheses:
  • The Lean statement does not assume n ≥ 6 (or ≥ 5), while the NL statement requires n ≥ 6.
  • The Lean statement does not assume N is proper. The NL statement requires N to be a proper normal subgroup of A_n.
- Wrong normality context:
  • The NL statement: N is normal in A_n (N ⫳ A_n).
  • The Lean statement: N is normal in S_n (N ⫳ Perm (Fin n)), a strictly stronger and different hypothesis.
- Ambient group and target subgroup:
  • The NL statement defines G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i} and asks to show G_i ⊆ N. So G_i is the point stabilizer within A_n.
  • The Lean statement attempts to include the full stabilizer in S_n (no restriction to even permutations) and claim it is contained in N. This is stronger and not equivalent: it does not match G_i = stabilizer in A_n.
- Object mismatch/nonstandard identifier:
  • Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n)) is not a standard Mathlib construct for “permutations fixing i” and appears to be ill-typed (casts i : Fin n to a permutation). The correct Mathlib object would be Equiv.Perm.stabilizer i : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n)). The current code likely does not compile and does not clearly denote the intended subgroup.
- Properness and group inclusion formulation:
  • The NL statement says “N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n,” i.e., N ≤ A_n, N ⫳ A_n, and N ≠ A_n.
  • The Lean code encodes only N ≤ A_n (via hN) and N ⫳ S_n (via [N.Normal]), and omits properness N ≠ A_n.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement differs in key hypotheses (n ≥ 6 missing; properness missing; normality is in S_n rather than in A_n) and in the object being contained (it targets an unclear set, seemingly the S_n stabilizer, not the A_n stabilizer G_i). Additionally, the identifier for the stabilizer is nonstandard/likely invalid and coerces i incorrectly, which undermines the faithful translation. Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the NL statement.

Grade rationale:
- Multiple mismatches in hypotheses, ambient group, and target subgroup; also an apparently invalid/non-Mathlib identifier. The code is related to the topic but significantly off. Hence a low grade.

- This states: Let G be a finite group, and let p and r be natural numbers with p prime and r ≥ 1, and suppose |G| = p^r. Additionally, assume a fintype structure on the subtype `{ g : G // ∀ x : G, g * x = x * g }` (the set of central elements). Then there exists a natural number k with 1 ≤ k such that the cardinality of that subtype (i.e., the center) equals p^k.
- The subtype `{ g : G // ∀ x : G, g * x = x * g }` is exactly the center Z(G) as a subset of G; the equality condition is symmetric so it matches the usual center definition. Using `Fintype.card` on this subtype is exactly counting |Z(G)|.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- NL: Let G be a group of order p^r with p prime and r ≥ 1. Prove that |Z(G)| = p^k for some integer k ≥ 1.
- Lean: Exactly assumes G is finite with |G| = p^r, p prime, r ≥ 1, and concludes there exists k ≥ 1 with |Z(G)| = p^k. The only extra hypothesis is `(hZ : Fintype { ... })`, i.e., a fintype structure on the center. Mathematically, this is redundant because a subset of a finite type is finite; in Mathlib, there is typically an instance `Fintype {x // p x}` given `[Fintype G]` (with classical decidability), so this extra assumption does not change the mathematical content.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- The core content matches: under the p-group hypothesis, the center has order p^k with k ≥ 1. The target set is indeed the center, and the conclusion states exactly the desired cardinality form.
- Minor divergence: the extra hypothesis `hZ` is unnecessary but benign; it does not weaken or alter the statement because it follows from `[Fintype G]`. The code also uses a direct subtype rather than `Subgroup.center G`, but the predicate defining the subtype matches the center, so this is faithful.
- No vacuous or fake definitions; no placeholders other than the proof `by sorry`, which is acceptable per the task.

Given the above, the translation is faithful, with a small nonessential extra hypothesis. Under the harsh rubric, I deduct slightly for the extraneous assumption and not using Mathlib's `Subgroup.center`, but the mathematical meaning is the same.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We work with matrices indexed by a finite type `n` (rather than a natural number). This is standard in Mathlib: `Matrix n n R` represents n×n matrices when `n` is a finite type. The decidable equality is for matrix indexing.
- `def SL : Set (Matrix n n Real) := { A | Matrix.det A = 1 }`: Defines the set of real n×n matrices whose determinant equals 1. This matches the set in the natural language statement.
- `noncomputable def SL_group : Group ({ A : Matrix n n Real // Matrix.det A = 1 }) := by sorry`: Attempts to define a `Group` structure on the subtype of matrices with determinant 1. However, the entire structure is filled with `sorry`, so the group operations, identity, inverses, and proofs of axioms are not provided.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement is: Show that SL(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(R) : det A = 1} is a group under matrix multiplication. In Lean, a faithful translation would either:
- Provide a `Group` instance on the subtype `{A : Matrix n n ℝ // det A = 1}` using inherited matrix multiplication, identity, and inverse (and prove closure, etc.), or
- Reference the existing Mathlib structure `SpecialLinearGroup n ℝ` which already has a `Group` instance, or
- State a theorem claiming that this subtype carries a group structure under matrix multiplication.

The code does define the correct set, but the group structure is left as `sorry`. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not ensure the operation is matrix multiplication, nor that the axioms hold. Per the auditing guidelines, the presence of `sorry` in a definition is a red flag: the auxiliary definition is vacuous and thus the translation fails.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Missing/placeholder proof: The group structure is not actually defined; it's a placeholder.
- The phrase ""under matrix multiplication"" is not enforced; the `Group` structure could be anything because of `sorry`.
- Modeling detail: Using a finite type `n` instead of a natural number is acceptable in Mathlib and not an issue.
- They define the set `SL` but don't connect it to the group structure (which is on the subtype) explicitly. That is fine if completed, but currently it's incomplete.

Conclusion: Not faithful because of the vacuous `sorry` in the crucial definition. If the `sorry` were replaced by the inherited group structure (or by using Mathlib's `SpecialLinearGroup`), it would be faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {F : Type _} [Field F]` and `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We fix a field F and an index type n that is finite and decidable, so we work with n×n matrices over F in the mathlib style (indexing by a finite type rather than a natural number). This matches the usual GL_n(F) context up to the standard equivalence.
- `open Matrix`: Brings matrix-related notation into scope.
- `def H (G : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n F))) : Set (Units (Matrix n n F)) := { A | A ∈ (G : Set (Units (Matrix n n F))) ∧ (det (A.val : Matrix n n F) = (1 : F) ∨ det (A.val : Matrix n n F) = -1) }`: Defines H as the set of invertible n×n matrices (viewed as units in the matrix ring) that lie in G and have determinant ±1. This matches the intended set H = {A ∈ G : det A = ±1}. The use of `A.val` extracts the underlying matrix from the unit A.
- `def H_is_subgroup (G : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n F))) : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n F)) := by sorry`: Declares a definition that is supposed to produce a subgroup of the ambient group Units(Matrix n n F), presumably corresponding to H, but the body is `sorry` (a placeholder). It does not explicitly mention the previously defined set H in the result type, nor does it assert or prove the inclusion into G; it’s just a placeholder returning some subgroup structure without content.

2) Does this faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Let F be a field, G ≤ GL_n(F), define H = {A ∈ G : det(A) = ±1}. Prove H is a subgroup of G.
- The code adopts Units(Matrix n n F) instead of the mathlib type GL n F. This is a standard equivalent representation (units of the matrix algebra are exactly the invertible matrices), so this modeling choice is acceptable.
- The definition of the set H is faithful: it is exactly {A ∈ G | det A = ±1}.
- However, the crucial “prove H is a subgroup of G” part is not provided: `H_is_subgroup` is a `def` with `by sorry`, so it is a vacuous placeholder rather than a legitimate subgroup structure built from that set. Moreover, the `def`’s type returns a `Subgroup (Units (Matrix ...))` without tying it to the previously defined set H or showing it is contained in G; the connection is at best implicit. There is no proof or even a statement that the returned subgroup has carrier equal to the set H.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The primary issue is the vacuous placeholder `sorry` in `H_is_subgroup`. Per the guidelines, this fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous placeholders.
  - The result is not explicitly the subgroup with carrier H, nor is there an inclusion proof `≤ G`. The intended statement is that the subset H forms a subgroup (in the ambient group) and is contained in G. The code neither constructs that subgroup nor proves the inclusion, and it does not reference the H set in the subgroup construction.
  - The ambient group is `Units (Matrix n n F)` rather than `GL n F`, which is fine conceptually, but this part alone is not the issue; the main failure is the lack of a faithful, non-vacuous construction/proof.

Conclusion: The translation fails because the key part is a placeholder and not a faithful statement/proof that H is a subgroup of G.

  Natural language: Let p be a prime and G a finite abelian group that is a p-group. Then for every subgroup H of G, if H is a proper maximal subgroup of G (i.e., any subgroup K containing H is either H or all of G), then the index [G : H] equals p. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Does this match the original statement?
Original statement: Let p be a prime. Show that the composition factors of any finite abelian p-group are all isomorphic to Z_p.

Comparison:
- The Lean theorem only asserts: In a finite abelian p-group, any maximal proper subgroup of G has index p.
- The original statement concerns composition factors (i.e., quotients in a composition series). It asserts these factors are all isomorphic to Z_p.
- The theorem does not mention composition series, composition factors, or isomorphism to ZMod p. It concludes only the index of a maximal subgroup in G is p.
- While the stated theorem is a key ingredient (indeed, in an abelian group, a maximal subgroup is normal, so G/H is a simple abelian group of order p and hence isomorphic to Z/pZ), the code does not state or quantify over a composition series, nor does it conclude isomorphism to ZMod p.
- The comment “In particular …” is not part of the theorem statement and provides no formal guarantee.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code gives a property of maximal subgroups of G (index p) but does not state that all composition factors are isomorphic to Z_p. It also does not address the iterative nature across a composition series (though the theorem is polymorphic and could be applied to each subgroup-as-a-group, that is not expressed). It furthermore does not explicitly conclude the isomorphism, only an index equality.

Additional notes:
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this translation audit.
- The use of both [Group G] and [CommGroup G] is redundant but harmless.
- The theorem is strictly weaker than the natural language statement and thus not a faithful translation.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We work over a commutative ring R.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type n is finite with decidable equality, so we are considering n×n matrices where n is a finite type (standing in for a natural number dimension).
- Ambient objects: `(Matrix n n R)ˣ` denotes the group of units of the matrix ring, i.e., invertible n×n matrices over R. Subgroups of this form correspond to “matrix groups” inside GL(n, R).
- The docstring says: If G and H are subgroups of GL(n, R) (realized as the units of Matrix n n R), then their intersection is again a subgroup (a matrix group).
- `def matrix_group_intersection (G H : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ)) : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := by sorry`: This intends to define the intersection subgroup, but it leaves the definition as `sorry` (an unfinished proof/definition placeholder).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: Let G, H ⊆ GL(n) be matrix groups (subgroups consisting of n×n matrices). Prove that G ∩ H is a matrix group. This is exactly the standard fact: intersection of subgroups is a subgroup.
- The Lean code sets up the right context (subgroups of the group of invertible matrices) and intends to produce the intersection as a subgroup.
- However, the definition is not actually provided; it is a placeholder `sorry`. That violates the guideline requiring no vacuous/placeholder definitions. Moreover, the definition should be something like `G ⊓ H` (the inf of subgroups, whose carrier is the set-theoretic intersection). As written, it does not define anything.

Step 3: Final comparison of the two statements.
- Mathematical content alignment: If the `sorry` were replaced by `exact G ⊓ H`, the content would be faithful: it would define the intersection subgroup, matching the statement that G ∩ H is a matrix group. The use of `(Matrix n n R)ˣ` to model GL(n, R) is acceptable for this purpose.
- Issues:
  - The use of `sorry` makes the definition vacuous/unfinished.
  - The code does not explicitly relate to set-theoretic intersection or prove any property; it only attempts to define a subgroup but does not supply the definition.

Conclusion: Because of the placeholder `sorry`, the translation fails per the strict auditing guidelines. If the `sorry` were replaced appropriately (e.g., `G ⊓ H`), it would be a faithful translation.

Grade rationale: Vacuous definition present, but if fixed, the final statement would be correct and faithful. Thus grade 6.

- Theorem signature: `theorem matrix_group_contains_one {n : Nat} (G : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real)) ... : (1 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real) ∈ G := by sorry`
  - Universe: Fix a natural number n and consider G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(R) (represented as matrices indexed by Fin n × Fin n over Real).
  - Hypotheses:
    - `h_nonempty : ∃ A, A ∈ G`: G is nonempty.
    - `h_mul : ∀ A B, A ∈ G → B ∈ G → A * B ∈ G`: G is closed under matrix multiplication.
    - `h_inv : ∀ A, A ∈ G → ∃ B, B ∈ G ∧ A * B = 1 ∧ B * A = 1`: For every A in G, there exists B in G such that B is a two-sided inverse of A (AB = BA = I). This expresses closure under inverses in a concrete way.
  - Conclusion: `(1 : Matrix ...) ∈ G`: The identity matrix belongs to G.

Assessment of alignment with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(R) be nonempty and closed under products and inverses. Prove that the identity matrix I belongs to G.
- The Lean hypotheses precisely encode:
  - Nonempty: yes (`∃ A, A ∈ G`).
  - Closed under products: yes (`∀ A B ∈ G, A*B ∈ G`).
  - Closed under inverses: The Lean code states for each A ∈ G, there is B ∈ G with AB = BA = I. This is exactly saying the inverse of A (in the ambient ring of matrices) lies in G; requiring both left and right inverses is a standard precise way to assert B = A⁻¹. It is fully faithful (if anything, more explicit) to “closed under inverses.”
- Conclusion matches: identity matrix belongs to G.

Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; all hypotheses are substantive and standard.
- No mismatch in domain (exactly n×n real matrices).
- No extra/unnecessary assumptions beyond the intended meaning.
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale: Exact and faithful translation with appropriate Mathlib types and no placeholders.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `orthonormal_basis_of_orthogonal` is stated for a finite index type `n`, a real square matrix `A : Matrix n n Real`, and a hypothesis `h` asserting that for all indices `i, j : n`, the sum over `k` of `A k i * A k j` equals `if i = j then 1 else 0`. This hypothesis is exactly the statement that the columns of `A` are orthonormal with respect to the standard inner product (their pairwise dot products are the Kronecker delta).
- The conclusion is that the family of columns `(fun i => Matrix.col A i)` is linearly independent and their span is the whole space, i.e., `Submodule.span Real (Set.range (fun i => Matrix.col A i)) = ⊤`. This means they form a basis of the ambient space `n → ℝ` (which corresponds to ℝ^n when `n = Fin d`).
- No proof is provided (`by sorry`), but we are checking translation, not proof.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Let A ∈ O(n) with columns A₁,…,Aₙ. Deduce that {A₁,…,Aₙ} is an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ.
- Mismatches:
  - Hypothesis: The code assumes directly the orthonormality of the columns via the Kronecker delta identity. The NL statement assumes A ∈ O(n). While these are essentially equivalent in standard linear algebra (A orthogonal ⇔ columns form an orthonormal set), the code does not mention or use the notion of A ∈ O(n) or the orthogonal group. This is not fatal by itself if the rest matched, but it is a deviation from the stated premise.
  - Conclusion: The code concludes only that the columns form a basis (linear independence + spanning). It does not assert orthonormality in the conclusion. In fact, orthonormality is an assumption, not something deduced. The NL statement requires concluding that the set is an orthonormal basis, i.e., both orthonormal and a basis. The code’s statement only delivers the “basis” part (and even that only under the stronger assumption that the columns are already orthonormal). It never packages the result as “orthonormal basis,” nor uses Mathlib’s `Orthonormal` or `Basis` constructs.
  - Missing connection from A ∈ O(n) to orthonormal columns: The code does not include nor derive the orthonormality from A being orthogonal; it presupposes it.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The NL asks: from A ∈ O(n), deduce the columns form an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ. The code assumes the columns are orthonormal and concludes they form a basis, omitting the orthonormal part in the conclusion and never encoding membership in O(n). Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes on Mathlib usage:
- The code does not use Mathlib’s `OrthogonalGroup` O(n) or `Orthonormal` predicate or `Basis`. It uses a coordinate sum condition for orthonormality and expresses “basis” via linear independence plus span = ⊤. This is acceptable in principle, but the mismatch with the NL statement remains.

Conclusion: Not faithful; the statement in Lean is weaker/different in structure and misses the crucial “orthonormal” part of the conclusion while assuming it in the hypothesis instead of deducing it from A ∈ O(n).

This is vacuous.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language asks:
1) Prove that G = {[[a,-b],[b,a]] : a,b ∈ R} is a group under matrix addition.
2) Construct an isomorphism (C, +) ≅ G.

The code attempts to:
- Represent G as an AddSubgroup of matrices (which would give it an additive group structure on the subtype), and
- Provide an AddEquiv between Complex and that subgroup.

Conceptually, this matches the mathematical content: an additive subgroup structure corresponds to G being a group under addition, and an AddEquiv is exactly an additive group isomorphism. The function complex_to_mat correctly portrays the intended correspondence.

However, the crucial pieces are placeholders/incomplete:
- G_add_subgroup is not actually defined (the body is an unfinished tactic state). It doesn’t even specify the underlying set/carrier as the range of complex_to_mat or the set of matrices of the stated form.
- complex_matrix_add_equiv is defined via sorry, so the isomorphism is not constructed; it’s a vacuous placeholder.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- The intended meanings align (G as those 2×2 real matrices; additive group structure; additive isomorphism with Complex), but the code does not actually define G or the isomorphism. Both key definitions are left as placeholders/sorries.
- By the strict auditing guidelines, this fails: auxiliary definitions are vacuous/unfinished, and the final isomorphism is a sorry. Even if the plan is faithful, the provided Lean code is not a legitimate, faithful translation.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced with correct Mathlib constructions (defining G as the range of complex_to_mat or as a set predicate, proving it’s an AddSubgroup, and constructing the AddEquiv explicitly), then it would be faithful. As-is, it fails due to vacuity.

Grade rationale: Vacuous/unfinished definitions but, if fixed, the final statements would be faithful to the original. This fits a 6 per the rubric.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines, for each real θ, a 2×2 real matrix H θ with entries
  H θ = [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), -cos(2θ)]]. This is the standard formula for the matrix of reflection across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis.
- `theorem reflection_matrix_improper_orthogonal (θ : ℝ) : (H θ * (H θ).transpose = 1) ∧ (Matrix.det (H θ) = (-1 : ℝ)) := by sorry` states that for each θ, H θ is orthogonal in the sense H θ · (H θ)^T = I, and has determinant −1.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The NL statement has two parts:
  1) For each θ, the reflection of R^2 across the specified line is a linear operator.
  2) Its matrix H_θ is an improper orthogonal matrix: H_θ ∈ O(2) and det H_θ = −1.
- The code correctly defines the standard reflection matrix H θ and states orthogonality and determinant −1. The condition H θ · (H θ)^T = I is equivalent to H_θ ∈ O(2), so part (2) is captured.
- However, the code does not mention or assert that the reflection map is a linear operator, nor does it explicitly define the reflection as a linear map and identify H θ as its matrix. While any 2×2 matrix induces a linear operator, and H θ is indeed the reflection matrix by its explicit formula, the explicit statement “the reflection is linear” is missing.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; H is concrete, and the theorem’s properties match the intended improper orthogonality. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task, but does not affect faithfulness.

Final comparison:
- The second part (improper orthogonality of H_θ) is faithfully represented.
- The first part (explicitly stating the reflection is a linear operator) is missing. Also, the code does not explicitly connect H θ to “the reflection” as a linear map, though it uses the correct formula.

Conclusion: The translation is almost correct but not fully faithful due to omission of the linearity assertion (and the explicit identification of H θ as the matrix of the reflection map). Hence not fully faithful.

- def D_units : Set (Units (Matrix n n R)) := { U | is_diag (U.val : Matrix n n R) }: D_units is the set of invertible diagonal matrices, viewed as a subset of the group of units of the matrix ring (i.e., GL(n) modeled as Units (Matrix n n R)).
- theorem D_units_is_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) := by sorry: This claims the existence of some subgroup of Units (Matrix n n R), but it does not assert that this subgroup is precisely D_units. There is no connection in the statement to D_units at all.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The natural language statement: “Let D(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in GL(n). Show that D(n) is a matrix group.” This means: the subset of GL(n) consisting of diagonal matrices is a subgroup of GL(n).

The code makes a reasonable attempt to represent:
- GL(n) as Units (Matrix n n R) (acceptable model).
- D(n) as D_units (subset of units whose underlying matrix is diagonal).

However, the final theorem does not state that D_units is a subgroup. It merely produces (with sorry) an arbitrary Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) without any relation to D_units. This completely fails to express the intended assertion.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
- Intended: “D_units is a subgroup of Units (Matrix n n R).”
- Given: “There exists a Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)).”
These are not the same. The code’s theorem is vacuous with respect to D_units. Moreover, it is filled with a sorry and does not even set up the correct statement to prove.

Additional notes:
- Defining is_diag is fine and faithful. Using Units (Matrix n n R) for GL(n) is acceptable. The CommRing assumption is stronger than necessary but not harmful to faithfulness.
- The critical failure is the theorem’s statement: it must define a Subgroup whose carrier is D_units (or assert IsClosed under mul/inv/one for D_units). As written, it is unrelated to D_units and thus not a faithful translation.

Conclusion: The translation fails.

  This states that for any two 2×2 real matrices A and B, if each is a reflection (orthogonal with det −1), then their product A*B is a rotation (orthogonal with det 1).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement: ""Show that the product of any two reflection matrices in O(2) is a rotation matrix (i.e., an element of SO(2))."" The Lean code defines reflections as orthogonal with det −1 (i.e., elements of O(2) with det −1) and rotations as orthogonal with det 1 (i.e., SO(2)). The theorem asserts exactly that the product of two such reflections is a rotation. The use of 2×2 real matrices matches O(2) and SO(2) over ℝ. No proofs are required; only the statement's translation matters.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses explicit matrix-based predicates instead of the Mathlib bundled types O(2) and SO(2), but the properties (orthogonal + determinant conditions) are exactly those that define membership in O(2) and SO(2). This is mathematically equivalent.
- The base field is ℝ and dimension is 2 in both the NL statement and the code.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; both definitions are substantive and standard.
Thus, the translation is faithful with no substantive differences.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the mathlib library.
- Comment explains the intended mathematical content: to state that SO(n) = {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ), but proof omitted.
- `open Matrix`: Opens the Matrix namespace.
- `def SO (n : Type*) [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n] : Subgroup (Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup n ℝ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Define SO(n) to be a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ). However, the definition is left as `sorry`, so there is no actual content describing which subgroup it is. There is no mention of orthogonality, determinant, or the set {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1}.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: “Prove that SO(n) = {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group.” A “matrix group” here means a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ). A faithful Lean translation would either:
  - Define the subgroup explicitly as {A in GL(n, ℝ) that are orthogonal with det = 1}, or
  - Provide a theorem showing this set is a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ), or
  - Define SO(n) to be that specific subgroup and possibly prove its properties.
- The provided Lean code does none of these. It introduces a name `SO` and asserts it is a `Subgroup (Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup n ℝ)` but leaves the entire construction as `sorry`. There is no reference to O(n) (orthogonality), determinant 1, or any set equality. Thus it is a vacuous placeholder and not a faithful translation.

Red flags per guidelines:
- Vacuous/placeholder content: `by sorry` in a definition of a subgroup is a vacuous stand-in and fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and not placeholders.
- Missing the core content: No definition of O(n), no determinant condition, no set equality.
- Even the target type, while consistent with “matrix group,” does not ensure that the subset corresponds to the intended set; the definition does not specify which subgroup.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The NL statement asks to prove a specific set is a matrix group. The Lean code merely asserts the existence/name of some subgroup `SO(n)` of GL(n, ℝ) without tying it to the set {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1}. Hence they are different.

Grade rationale:
- Because a vacuous placeholder is used and the specific set {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is not encoded at all, the translation fails. However, if the `sorry` were replaced by a legitimate construction of the subgroup matching that set, and possibly a theorem demonstrating closure, the shape could become faithful. Therefore, grade 6 (vacuous but fixable to faithful).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv Subgroup`: Bring in Mathlib and open namespaces for equivalences and subgroups.
- `noncomputable section`: Allows noncomputable definitions.
- `def sigma (n : ℕ) : Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.ofBijective (fun i : Fin n => Fin.ofNat n (i.val + 1)) (by sorry)`: This intends to define the n-cycle on `Fin n` that maps `i` to `i+1 mod n`. It uses `Equiv.ofBijective` to turn a function into a permutation, but the bijectivity proof is left as `sorry`.
- The theorem `symmetric_generated_by_transposition_and_cycle (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : Subgroup.closure ({swap (Fin.ofNat n 0) (Fin.ofNat n 1), sigma n} : Set (Perm (Fin n))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n))) := by sorry` states that for `n ≥ 2`, the subgroup of `Perm (Fin n)` generated by the two elements `(0 1)` (expressed as `swap (Fin.ofNat n 0) (Fin.ofNat n 1)`) and the cycle `sigma n` is the whole group `(⊤)`, i.e., the symmetric group on `n` letters.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For `n ≥ 2`, `Sym_n` is generated by `S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}`.
- Lean: For `n ≥ 2`, `Perm (Fin n)` is generated by `{(0 1), (0 1 2 ... n-1)}`. This is the same content using 0-based indexing on `Fin n`. The top subgroup equals the whole symmetric group, so the generation statement matches conceptually. The notational shift from `(1,2)` and `(1,2,...,n)` to `(0,1)` and `(0,1,...,n-1)` is a harmless relabeling.

Issues and red flags per the strict guidelines:
- The auxiliary definition `sigma` is introduced via `Equiv.ofBijective` with the bijectivity proof as `by sorry`. This makes the definition incomplete/vacuous under the auditing rules: auxiliary definitions must be fully and faithfully defined, not rely on `sorry`.
- The theorem proof itself can be `sorry` per the instructions (“No proofs are used”), but the auxiliary definition containing `sorry` is not acceptable.
- Aside from that, the mathematical content of the theorem matches the natural statement (up to indexing relabeling), and the use of `Perm (Fin n)` for `Sym_n` is standard and faithful.

Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? Conceptually, yes: both assert that the symmetric group on `n` letters is generated by a specific adjacent transposition and an n-cycle. The only substantive mismatch is the use of a `sorry` in the auxiliary definition, violating the guideline about non-vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion:
- Not faithful under the strict auditing rules due to the `sorry` in the definition of `sigma`.
- If the bijectivity proof were supplied, the translation would be faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Bring in Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- def gl (n : ℕ) : Type := { A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real // Matrix.det A ≠ 0 }: Define gl(n) to be the subtype of n×n real matrices whose determinant is nonzero, i.e., GL(n, R) as a set/type.
- def gl_group (n : ℕ) : Group (gl n) := by sorry: Attempt to define a group structure on gl(n), but leave the entire structure as a placeholder using sorry.

Step 2: Assess whether the translation matches the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Show that GL(n) = {A in Mat_{n×n}(R) : det A ≠ 0} is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The definition gl faithfully captures GL(n, R) as the set of invertible (det ≠ 0) matrices over R. This part matches.
- However, the group structure is not provided. The code uses `def gl_group ... := by sorry`, which does not specify the multiplication or any group axioms. In particular, it does not assert that the group operation is matrix multiplication; it does not even provide any operation at all. The placeholder is vacuous.
- Moreover, the natural language specifies ""under matrix multiplication""; the Lean code does not encode that crucial detail. A correct Lean translation would either:
  - Provide an explicit Group structure on gl(n) whose `mul` is inherited/restricted from matrix multiplication and verify the axioms (with proofs omitted only for the axioms, not for the data), or
  - Declare an instance `instance : Group (gl n)` explicitly tied to matrix multiplication, or
  - Refer to Mathlib’s existing general linear group `GeneralLinearGroup n ℝ` and its equivalence to this subtype.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
- Differences:
  - The provided code gives a vacuous `Group (gl n)` via `sorry`, so it neither ensures nor even states that the multiplication is matrix multiplication. This is a significant mismatch.
  - The use of `sorry` to define the structure violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders; the group structure is not defined at all.
- Conclusion: The Lean code does not faithfully translate the statement. It correctly defines the underlying set GL(n, ℝ), but fails to express (or enforce) the group structure under matrix multiplication.

Additional notes:
- While Mathlib has notions like `GeneralLinearGroup n ℝ`, the custom subtype `gl n` is acceptable if a proper group structure by restricting matrix multiplication is provided. Here, it is not.

Grade rationale:
- The definition of `gl` is faithful. The group structure is completely missing (vacuous via `sorry`) and does not specify multiplication, so the translation fails but is fixable by supplying the correct restricted multiplication and axioms. This corresponds to a grade of about 6 per the rubric.

  This defines the orthogonal group O(n) as a subtype of n×n real matrices consisting of those matrices A satisfying A Aᵀ = I. This faithfully matches the set {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(R) : A A^T = I}.
- `noncomputable def O_group (n : ℕ) : Group (O n) := by sorry`:
  This claims to define a group structure on O(n) but leaves the entire construction and proofs as `sorry`. The accompanying comment says the group structure is inherited from matrix multiplication, identity = 1, and inverse = transpose, but comments are non-binding; the code does not enforce that the group operation is matrix multiplication, nor that inverse is transpose, nor provide required closure proofs.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Using (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T, prove that O(n) = {A : A A^T = I} is a group under matrix multiplication.” So the desired formalization should present O(n) as a type/subtype and equip it with the group structure coming specifically from matrix multiplication, with identity I, and inverse given by transpose (or equivalently A^{-1} = A^T), and should at least state this structure (proofs can be omitted in this auditing framework only if the statements themselves are precise and not vacuous).
- The definition of `O n` is faithful.
- However, `O_group` is a vacuous placeholder: it uses `sorry`, so it does not actually define the multiplication, identity, or inverse on `O n`, nor does it assert they correspond to matrix multiplication/identity/transpose. Since `Group (O n)` could in principle be any group structure, this does not faithfully express “under matrix multiplication.” The code relies on a comment to describe the intended operations, which is insufficient.
- Moreover, per the strict guidelines, any auxiliary definition filled with `sorry` is considered vacuous, causing the translation to fail.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Intended math problem: Show O(n) under matrix multiplication is a group (i.e., close under multiplication, identity = I, inverse = transpose).
- Lean code: Correctly defines the set O(n) but only asserts there exists some group structure on it via a `sorry`, without binding it to matrix multiplication. Therefore, they are not the same; the crucial aspect “under matrix multiplication” is not captured by the formal statement, and the use of `sorry` makes the group structure vacuous.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the vacuous `O_group` and the lack of explicit linkage to matrix multiplication.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Field: Lean fixes matrices over ℝ; the NL statement implicitly refers to real O(2), which is standard. No mismatch.

  • row i = 0, column j = 0: 1
  • row i = 0, column j ≠ 0: t (since Fin 2 has only 0 and 1, this means (0,1) = t)
  • row i ≠ 0 (i = 1), column j = 0: 0 (so (1,0) = 0)
  • row i = 1, column j = 1: 1
  So E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]]. This matches the intended matrix.
- theorem E_mul_inverse (t : F) : E t * E (-t) = 1 := by sorry: For all t in F, the product of E(t) with E(-t) equals 1, where 1 is the identity 2x2 matrix. This asserts that E(-t) is a right-inverse of E(t).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The NL statement: For all t in F, E(t)^{-1} = E(-t). This means E(-t) is the (two-sided) inverse of E(t), i.e., both E(t) * E(-t) = I and E(-t) * E(t) = I, or equivalently that E(-t) equals the inverse of E(t) in the sense of invertibility.

The Lean theorem only states E t * E (-t) = 1 (right-inverse). It does not state E (-t) * E t = 1, nor does it assert the equality E (-t) = (E t)⁻¹. While in the setting of 2×2 matrices over a field, AB = I indeed implies BA = I and B = A^{-1}, the code as written does not claim that stronger conclusion. Therefore, the theorem is strictly weaker than the NL statement.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- NL: E(-t) is the inverse of E(t), i.e., equality with the inverse.
- Lean: E(-t) is a right-inverse of E(t).
These are not the same statements; the Lean code misses the left-inverse direction or the explicit equality with the inverse element. Hence the translation is not faithful.

No vacuous placeholders are used (E is defined concretely), and the ambient structures are correct. The only issue is the final theorem is weaker than the target statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement sets α = (1,2), β = (1,2,3) in S3, defines G = ⟨α, β⟩, and asks to show G = S3. The Lean code represents S3 as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)` with elements 0,1,2, defines α = (0 1) (corresponding to (1 2)), β as (0 1 2) (corresponding to (1 2 3)), defines G as the subgroup generated by these, and asserts that this subgroup is the whole S3. This is a faithful translation.

3) Final check and differences:
- Minor notational difference: the code uses Fin 3 = {0,1,2} instead of {1,2,3}. This is standard and mathematically equivalent.
- The theorem statement uses `Subgroup.closure ({alpha, beta}) = ⊤` rather than `G = ⊤`, but since `G` was defined as that closure, the statements are identical.

- `def SO2 : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { A | Matrix.transpose A * A = 1 ∧ Matrix.det A = 1 }` defines SO(2) as the set of 2×2 real matrices that satisfy Aᵀ A = I (orthogonal) and det A = 1 (proper/special). This is the usual definition of the special orthogonal group in 2D, expressed as a set of matrices.

The proof is omitted, which is allowed for our translation audit.
Assessment of fidelity:
- The natural language statement claims that SO(2) (the group of all proper orthogonal 2×2 matrices) equals the set of rotation matrices R_θ for θ ∈ ℝ. The Lean code defines precisely those two sets and asserts their equality. No extraneous hypotheses are added, and no essential conditions are omitted. The definition Aᵀ A = 1 and det A = 1 is standard and equivalent to the intended notion of “proper orthogonal.”
- The rotation matrix is correctly encoded with the right entries and indexing. The use of Fin 2 ensures there are exactly four cases, and the final else corresponds to the (1,1)-entry.
- Although Mathlib has more abstract group-level structures (e.g., special orthogonal group), defining SO2 as a set of matrices via AᵀA = I and det A = 1 is entirely legitimate and faithful. There are no vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful.
Final check: The Lean statement “SO2 = Set.range rot” is exactly the natural statement “SO(2) is exactly the set of rotation matrices R_θ, θ ∈ ℝ.” They are the same mathematical statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: We use Mathlib's matrix and algebra infrastructure.
- def E_ij ... : Matrix n n R := fun a b => if a = b then 1 else if a = i ∧ b = j then t else 0: For a finite index type n over a commutative ring R, define the n×n matrix E_ij(t) having 1 on the diagonal, t in the (i, j) entry (when i ≠ j), and 0 elsewhere. This is exactly the identity matrix plus t at position (i, j), i.e., the standard “row addition” elementary matrix.
- theorem E_ij_det_one ... (h : i ≠ j) : (E_ij i j t).det = 1 := by sorry: For distinct indices i, j, the determinant of E_ij(t) is 1. The proof is omitted (sorry), but only the statement matters for translation.

Step 2: Compare the overall translation to the natural language statement.
Natural language: For 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n and t ∈ ℝ, let E_{ij}(t) be the elementary matrix obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i. Prove E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n).
- The Lean code defines the matrix with entries matching identity except a t in the (i, j) position, which is precisely the standard elementary matrix that effects “add t times row j to row i” under left multiplication (with i ≠ j taken as a hypothesis in the theorem). So the definition matches the intended elementary matrix.
- The theorem states det(E_ij(t)) = 1 for i ≠ j. In Mathlib, SL(n, R) (SpecialLinearGroup) is the subtype of matrices with determinant 1. Thus det = 1 is exactly the condition for membership in SL(n, R); since det = 1 is a unit, the matrix is invertible automatically over a commutative ring, matching the group intuition.
- The code’s R is any commutative ring, which is strictly more general than ℝ. This is acceptable as a stronger statement.
- Indices i, j range over a finite type n with [Fintype n], which corresponds to choosing an n-element index set (e.g., Fin n). The condition i ≠ j is present as a hypothesis, matching 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n in spirit.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The main difference is that the Lean theorem asserts det(E_ij(t)) = 1 rather than explicitly stating E_ij(t) ∈ SL(n, R). However, in Mathlib, SpecialLinearGroup n R is defined by the predicate det = 1, so this is logically equivalent to membership in SL(n, R). No auxiliary vacuous definitions occur; E_ij is a concrete matrix definition.
- The ring is generalized from ℝ to any commutative ring R; this is a strengthening, not a mismatch.
- The code does not explicitly construct an element of SpecialLinearGroup (i.e., ⟨E_ij, proof⟩), but proving det = 1 is precisely the required condition and thus is an equivalent formulation.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to the minor presentation difference (det = 1 vs. explicit SL membership). Given the accepted logical equivalence, this is effectively the same statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib: Bring in Mathlib.
- variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]: Work over a commutative ring R.
- variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]: Index type for n×n matrices is a finite type with decidable equality.
- def is_diagonal (M : Matrix n n R) : Prop := ∀ i j, i ≠ j → M i j = 0: Define a predicate that a matrix is diagonal if all off-diagonal entries are zero. This matches the usual notion; Mathlib already has Matrix.IsDiag, but this is a faithful custom duplicate.
- def D1_set : Set (Matrix n n R) := {M | is_diagonal M ∧ Matrix.det M = 1}: Define the set of diagonal matrices with determinant 1 inside M_n(R). This matches “diagonal matrices in SL(n)” as a subset of all matrices.
- def D1 : Set ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := {u | is_diagonal (u : Matrix n n R) ∧ Matrix.det (u : Matrix n n R) = 1}: Define the corresponding subset inside the group of units (invertible matrices), i.e., a subset of GL_n(R), consisting of diagonal invertible matrices with determinant 1. This aligns with the idea of taking the diagonal part of SL(n) as a subset of GL(n).
- def D1_is_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := by sorry: Intended to assert that D1 is a subgroup of the units (a “matrix group”), but this is given via a placeholder proof (sorry).

Step 2: Does the whole translate the statement?
- The natural language statement: Let D1(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n). Show D1(n) is a matrix group.
- The code sets up the appropriate ambient structure (commutative ring R, size n) and defines the set of diagonal matrices with det = 1. It then defines the corresponding subset of invertible matrices and states (as a def) that it is a Subgroup of the units. This matches the mathematical meaning of “D1(n) is a matrix group (a subgroup of GL(n))”. Working over a general commutative ring R instead of a specific field is a standard generalization and is faithful.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- Major issue: The final assertion “D1_is_subgroup” is provided as a definition with ‘by sorry’. This is a vacuous placeholder and the code does not compile. Per the auditing guidelines, any use of sorry or vacuous content causes the translation to fail.
- Secondary note: They did not use Mathlib’s built-in SpecialLinearGroup or Matrix.IsDiag; while not fatal if the definitions are faithful, it’s a red flag but acceptable here since the custom definitions are correct.
- Typing alignment: The statement is framed as a subgroup of ((Matrix n n R)ˣ), which is the standard way to encode a matrix group in Mathlib. The content matches “diagonal matrices in SL(n) form a matrix group.”

Conclusion: Although the intended mathematical statement is captured, the presence of a placeholder ‘sorry’ for the subgroup construction violates the no-vacuous-definitions rule and the code does not compile. Therefore, the translation fails.

- Comment: States the intended theorem: for n ≥ 1 and permutations α, β of {1, ..., n} (encoded as `Perm (Fin n)`), the sign is multiplicative.
- `theorem sgn_mul {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 ≤ n) (α β : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Equiv.Perm.sign (α * β) = Equiv.Perm.sign α * Equiv.Perm.sign β := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let n be a natural number with n ≥ 1. Let α and β be permutations of Fin n (the n-element type, canonically isomorphic to {1, ..., n}). Then the sign of the product α * β equals the product of the signs: sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β). The sign here is Mathlib’s `Equiv.Perm.sign : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Int`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness.
- Domain: `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is the symmetric group S_n on an n-element set; `Fin n` is equivalent to {1, ..., n}. This matches the statement.
- Hypothesis: `(hn : 1 ≤ n)` aligns with “Let n ≥ 1”. It is an extra hypothesis but matches the natural language restriction; it is not weakening or strengthening improperly.
- Conclusion: `Equiv.Perm.sign (α * β) = Equiv.Perm.sign α * Equiv.Perm.sign β` exactly states multiplicativity of the sign: sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Using Fin n instead of {1, ..., n} is a standard encoding in Lean and is mathematically equivalent.
- The codomain of sgn in Mathlib is Int, but the natural statement does not specify the codomain beyond suggesting ±1; multiplication is the same, so this is faithful.
- The presence of the `hn` hypothesis mirrors the natural language “n ≥ 1”. It is not used in the expression but does not harm faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language theorem.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: brings in Mathlib.
- The theorem name and statement: `symmetric_group_generated_by_adjacent_transpositions (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : ... = ⊤` says: For a natural number n with 2 ≤ n, the subgroup generated (i.e., the subgroup closure) by a certain set of permutations equals the whole symmetric group on `Fin n`, i.e., the top subgroup `⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))`.
- The generating set: `Subgroup.closure (Set.range (fun i : Fin (n - 1) => ...))` is the subgroup generated by all elements of the form given by the function of `i : Fin (n - 1)`.
- Inside the function:
  - `let h1 : 1 ≤ n := Nat.le_trans (by decide) hn`: deduces 1 ≤ n from 2 ≤ n.
  - `let eq := Nat.sub_add_cancel h1`: obtains the equality `(n - 1) + 1 = n`.
  - `Equiv.swap (Fin.cast eq (Fin.castSucc i)) (Fin.cast eq (Fin.succ i))`: constructs the transposition swapping two elements of `Fin n`. Here, for `i : Fin (n-1)`, `Fin.castSucc i : Fin ((n-1)+1)` is the same value `i` viewed in `Fin (n)`, and `Fin.succ i : Fin ((n-1)+1)` is `i+1` in `Fin n`. The casts via `Fin.cast eq` align types using the equality `(n-1)+1 = n`. Thus, this term is exactly the adjacent transposition swapping the entries with indices `i` and `i+1` in `Fin n`.
- Therefore, `Set.range ...` is precisely the set of all adjacent transpositions {(0 1), (1 2), ..., (n-2 n-1)} in zero-based indexing on `Fin n`.
- The equality `= ⊤` asserts that the subgroup generated by these adjacent transpositions is the entire symmetric group `S_n` on `Fin n`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For n ≥ 2, the symmetric group S_n is generated by the adjacent transpositions {(1,2), (2,3), ..., (n-1,n)}.
- Lean statement: For n ≥ 2, `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` (i.e., S_n on 0..n-1) is generated by the adjacent transpositions {(0 1), (1 2), ..., (n-2 n-1)}. This is the same assertion with 0-based indexing instead of 1-based, which is a standard and faithful reindexing.
- The use of `Subgroup.closure` equals `⊤` is precisely the formalization of “generated by the set equals the whole group.”

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the lets `h1` and `eq` are legitimate equalities to manage types and are not placeholders.
- The objects used (`Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, `Equiv.swap`, `Subgroup.closure`, `Set.range`) are standard Mathlib concepts.
- The only difference from the natural language statement is 0-based vs 1-based indexing, which is mathematically equivalent.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language claim.

- `theorem injective_iff_ker_eq_bot {G H : Type*} [Group G] [Group H] (f : G →* H) :` We consider groups G and H and a group homomorphism f (expressed as a MonoidHom between groups in Mathlib).
- `Function.Injective (f : G → H) ↔ MonoidHom.ker f = (⊥ : Subgroup G) := by sorry` The statement claims: f is injective if and only if the kernel of f equals the bottom subgroup of G (the trivial subgroup {1}). No auxiliary definitions; no placeholders used.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement: For a group homomorphism f: G → H with kernel K, f is injective iff K is the trivial subgroup. The Lean theorem states: f is injective iff ker f = ⊥. This exactly matches the standard formulation, where ⊥ denotes the trivial subgroup and K is implicitly ker f. Using MonoidHom for a group homomorphism is standard in Mathlib; the kernel is a Subgroup defined as {x | f x = 1}.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural statement names the kernel K; the Lean statement writes ker f directly. These are equivalent.
- No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions. Works for noncommutative groups as expected.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof (which is acceptable per instructions).

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the mathematical statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Import Mathlib: we work in the Mathlib environment.
- Theorem statement: For any field F, define
  - E : F → Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F by E(t)(i,j) =
    • 1 if i=0,j=0;
    • t if i=0,j≠0;
    • 0 if i≠0,j=0;
    • 1 if i≠0,j≠0.
    This exactly encodes the 2×2 matrix [[1, t], [0, 1]].
  - G := { M : 2×2 matrices over F | ∃ t, M = E t }.
  The goal is the conjunction of three properties:
  (1) ∀ t1 t2, E t1 * E t2 = E (t1 + t2) (closure and the specific multiplication law);
  (2) E 0 = 1 (the identity matrix is in the set, and is E(0));
  (3) ∀ t, ∃ s, E t * E s = 1 ∧ E s * E t = 1 (each E(t) has a two-sided inverse E(s), namely s = −t, though the statement only requires existence).
  The proof is left as sorry, but we only audit the statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Let F be a field and G = {E(t) : t ∈ F} with E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]]. Prove that G is a matrix group under multiplication.
- To show a subset of matrices is a group under multiplication, one typically shows:
  • Associativity: automatically true for matrix multiplication.
  • Identity: 1 ∈ G; the code asserts E 0 = 1.
  • Closure: product of two elements of G is again in G; the code asserts E t1 * E t2 = E (t1 + t2), which in particular lies in G.
  • Inverses: for each element, its inverse is in G; the code asserts ∀ t, ∃ s with E t * E s = 1 and E s * E t = 1. Since E s is in G by definition of G, this ensures inverses lie in G.
- Thus the code states exactly the needed algebraic properties (associativity being inherited). The definition of E is faithful to the given 2×2 unipotent matrices.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code defines G but does not use it explicitly in the conclusion; instead it states the key properties directly for E. This still implies that G forms a group under matrix multiplication.
- It does not package the result as a Subgroup or as an instance of Group on G, but the statement given is logically sufficient to conclude that G is a group under multiplication.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: E and G are real, and the properties are concrete equalities about matrix multiplication.
- Slight stylistic mismatch (not using Subgroup/GL(2,F)), but mathematically the meaning aligns.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the claim that G is a group under matrix multiplication (a “matrix group”), though it does not package it as a Subgroup. This is close enough to be considered faithful.

- Comment: The quotient should be isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. This is just a comment, not a formal statement.
- `True := by sorry`: The actual statement of the theorem is simply True, with a placeholder proof.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: Show that the quaternion group Q = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = −1, (−1)^2 = 1, and usual multiplication rules, is presented by ⟨a, b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2⟩. Formally, this means the group with that presentation (i.e., the quotient of the free group on two generators by the normal closure of those relations) is isomorphic to Q8. One must specify Q8 (as the quaternion group) and assert an isomorphism between the quotient and Q8.

The Lean code does not state any isomorphism, does not define or reference the quaternion group object in Mathlib, and the theorem’s conclusion is just True. The definitions of a, b, and N are reasonable and on the right track, but the final theorem is vacuous and does not encode the desired statement. The comment about the quotient being isomorphic is not part of the formal statement.

Step 3: Final check and differences.

- The conclusion `∃ (f : G →* G × H), ((f : G → G × H) = fun x => (x, (1 : H))) ∧ Function.Injective (f : G → G × H)` reads: there exists a monoid/group homomorphism f from G to G × H such that the underlying function of f is exactly x ↦ (x, 1), and this function is injective.

- Equality `(f : G → G × H) = fun x => (x, (1 : H))` pins down the function to be exactly φ.
- `Function.Injective` matches “injective”.
- No extraneous or missing hypotheses: groups on G and H are required, consistent with needing 1 : H.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem transposition_factorization_identity_even (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :` Sets up the statement for a natural number n with n ≥ 1, matching the natural language premise.
- `∀ (l : List (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))),` For every list l of permutations of Fin n (i.e., elements of S_n).
- `l.prod = (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) →` If the product (composition) of the permutations in the list is the identity permutation.
- `(∀ σ ∈ l, ∃ (i j : Fin n), i ≠ j ∧ σ = Equiv.swap i j) →` And every element σ in the list is a transposition, i.e., σ equals swap i j for distinct i, j.
- `∃ m : ℕ, l.length = 2 * m` Then the length of l is even (equal to 2m for some m).
There are no auxiliary definitions; `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is standard for S_n, and `Equiv.swap i j` is the standard transposition. The requirement `i ≠ j` enforces that these are genuine transpositions. The identity is expressed as `1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`. The empty list case is allowed (and yields 0, which is even), which is consistent with the notion of an empty product being the identity.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement: For n ≥ 1, in S_n, every factorization of the identity as a product of transpositions uses an even number of transpositions. The Lean statement formalizes exactly this: it universally quantifies over any list (factorization) whose product is identity and whose entries are transpositions, and concludes that the number of transpositions (the list length) is even. Using Fin n instead of {1, ..., n} is a standard and faithful representation.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain match: S_n is represented as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`; faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `axiom A5_simple : Prop`: Introduces an uninterpreted proposition named ""A5_simple"". Intended meaning (from the comment) is ""A5 is simple,"" but there is no connection to Mathlib's group theory or the alternating group. It is just a bare propositional token.
- `axiom galois_group_general_quintic_is_S5 : Prop`: Another uninterpreted proposition intended to represent ""the Galois group of the general quintic is S5."" Again, no actual reference to Galois groups, fields, or S5 in Mathlib.
- `axiom general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals : Prop`: An uninterpreted proposition intended to mean ""the general quintic is solvable by radicals."" No definition of solvability by radicals is provided.
- `theorem general_quintic_not_solvable_by_radicals (hA5 : A5_simple) (hG : galois_group_general_quintic_is_S5) : ¬ general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals := by sorry`: States that assuming the two previous propositions, one can conclude the negation of the third proposition. Proof omitted (which is allowed for this task).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Assuming (i) A5 is simple and (ii) the symmetry/Galois group of the general quintic is S5, prove that the roots of a general quintic cannot be expressed in terms of radicals (i.e., the general quintic is not solvable by radicals).
- The formal theorem has the correct logical shape: from two assumptions, conclude that the general quintic is not solvable by radicals. So at a high level, the implication aligns with the intended statement.
- However, the Lean code does not use any Mathlib definitions for A5, simplicity, Galois group, S5, general quintic, or solvability by radicals. Instead, it introduces three bare propositions (as axioms) that serve as placeholders without content. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must faithfully describe what they are trying to say and should use applicable Mathlib concepts when possible.
- Moreover, declaring them as `axiom ... : Prop` makes them completely opaque and unconstrained; they are not even definitional abbreviations. Thus, the statement is essentially ""If P and Q then not R"" with no mathematical structure.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Mathematically intended: a precise Galois-theoretic statement involving concrete objects (A5, S5, Galois group of the general quintic over an appropriate base field, and solvability by radicals).
- Code: an implication between three unrelated propositional atoms. No tie to Mathlib or the underlying mathematics.
- Therefore they are not the same in a formalization sense. The shape matches, but the content is missing, so the translation fails.

Grade rationale:
- The high-level logical form matches, but all auxiliary notions are vacuous placeholders and do not use Mathlib. If those placeholders were replaced with faithful Mathlib definitions, the final theorem statement would be faithful. This fits the rubric for a grade around 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: ""If m and n are coprime then ZMod (m * n) is additively equivalent to ZMod m × ZMod n."" This describes the classical Chinese remainder theorem at the level of additive groups.
- `def zmod_mul_equiv_prod {m n : ℕ} (hc : Nat.Coprime m n) : AddEquiv (ZMod (m * n)) (ZMod m × ZMod n) := by sorry`
  This declares (without proof) a specific additive group isomorphism between ZMod (m*n) and ZMod m × ZMod n, under the hypothesis that m and n are coprime. In other words, it asserts the existence (indeed, provides a placeholder for a construction) of an additive group isomorphism, i.e., a group isomorphism in the additive sense.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The statement asks to show that if m and n are relatively prime, then C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n, where C_k denotes the cyclic group of order k.
- In Mathlib, ZMod k is the canonical representative of the cyclic group of order k (for k > 0) as an additive group. An `AddEquiv` between `ZMod (m * n)` and `ZMod m × ZMod n` is precisely an isomorphism of abelian groups corresponding to the stated isomorphism C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n.
- The product `×` is the direct product of additive groups, matching the intended group product in the statement.
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Nat.Coprime, ZMod, AddEquiv) and does not introduce vacuous placeholders; the `sorry` is only for the (omitted) proof, which is allowed.

3) Final check and differences:
- Representation: The statement uses abstract cyclic groups C_n; the code uses ZMod n, a standard faithful representative. This is acceptable and faithful.
- Domain subtlety: The natural language implicitly assumes n ≥ 1 (as ""order n""), while the code allows all natural numbers. Under the hypothesis `Nat.Coprime m n`, the only potential edge cases beyond the classical statement are when one of m or n is 1 (or 0 with the other 1), but the isomorphism still holds in Mathlib's `ZMod` setting. This does not detract from faithfulness to the intended theorem for positive integers.
- Conclusion: The Lean signature faithfully states the classical result.

Overall, the translation is faithful with standard and appropriate Mathlib concepts, and no vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Load Mathlib.
- variable {G : Type _} [Group G]: Work in an arbitrary group G.
- theorem presentation_a_eq_one (a b : G) (ha : a ^ 5 = 1) (hb : b ^ 2 = 1) (hab : b * a = a ^ 2 * b) : a = 1 := by sorry
  Translation: In any group G, if elements a and b satisfy a^5=1, b^2=1, and ba=a^2 b, then a=1.
- noncomputable def presentation_subgroup_is_ZMod2 (a b : G) (ha : a ^ 5 = 1) (hb : b ^ 2 = 1) (hab : b * a = a ^ 2 * b) : MulEquiv (Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G)) (Multiplicative (ZMod 2)) := by sorry
  Translation: In any group G, if a and b satisfy a^5=1, b^2=1, and ba=a^2 b, then the subgroup generated by a and b is isomorphic (via a multiplicative equivalence) to the multiplicative version of ZMod 2. In other words, ⟨a,b⟩ ≅ Z_2.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural statement: ""Show that the group given by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to Z_2.""
- The first theorem (a=1) is a plausible lemma consistent with the relations: from b a b = a^2 and b^2=1, one can derive a=a^4, hence a^3=1, and with a^5=1, deduce a=1. So this part is aligned but is just an auxiliary result, not the main isomorphism statement.
- The second declaration claims: For any group G and any elements a,b satisfying the relations, the subgroup ⟨a,b⟩ is isomorphic to Z_2. This is stronger than the natural statement and in fact false in general: if a=1 and b=1 in G, the relations are satisfied but ⟨a,b⟩ is the trivial subgroup, not Z_2. Thus the Lean statement overgeneralizes and makes an incorrect claim for arbitrary realizations. The natural statement is specifically about the abstract group with that presentation (the initial object), which indeed is isomorphic to Z_2. The code does not model the presented group; instead it makes a universal claim about any subgroup generated by such elements, which is not equivalent to the presentation statement.
- A faithful translation would be either: (i) define the presented group and prove it is isomorphic to Z_2, or (ii) prove that any subgroup generated by elements satisfying the relations is a quotient of Z_2 (hence either trivial or Z_2), and then specialize to the presented group to get Z_2 (or add a hypothesis ensuring b ≠ 1). The current code claims an isomorphism in all cases without needed conditions, which is not faithful.

Step 3: Final comparison.
Differences:
- Scope: The code claims a universal isomorphism for any realization of the relations inside any group, whereas the natural statement is about the abstract group defined by the presentation. This is a substantive difference.
- Correctness: The second claim is false in general (counterexample a=b=1), whereas the presented group is indeed Z_2. Hence the translation fails.
- The code does not define or refer to the presented group; it instead refers to Subgroup.closure in an ambient group, which is not the same object unless one chooses the ambient group to be the presented group and also ensures nontriviality of b.

No vacuous placeholder definitions were introduced (only sorry proofs, which are allowed for this task), but the main statement is not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `rotation_matrix (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the standard 2×2 rotation matrix [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]] indexed by `Fin 2`.
- `rotate (θ : ℝ) : (Fin 2 → ℝ) → (Fin 2 → ℝ) := ...` defines the linear map on vectors given by multiplication by `rotation_matrix θ` (written componentwise as a sum over coordinates).
- `SO2 := { M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // M ∈ Set.range rotation_matrix }` defines the subtype of 2×2 real matrices that are of the form `rotation_matrix θ` for some θ. This is the set of rotation matrices; in 2D this coincides with the usual set-theoretic description of SO(2), but it does not use Mathlib's `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` nor does it equip a group structure.
- `Rotations := { f : (Fin 2 → ℝ) → (Fin 2 → ℝ) // f ∈ Set.range rotate }` defines the subtype of functions that are rotations `rotate θ` for some θ. Again, no group structure is given; it is just a subset of functions.
- `SO2_equiv_rotations : SO2 ≃ Rotations := by sorry` states there is a bijection (type equivalence) between these two subtypes.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The NL statement says: “The matrix group SO(2) is isomorphic to the group {ρ_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} of rotations of ℝ².” This is a group isomorphism statement (i.e., an isomorphism of groups, preserving the multiplication/composition), not just a bijection of underlying sets.
- The Lean code only defines subtypes as sets (`Set.range` of the parameterizations) and asserts an `Equiv` (a bijection) between them. It does not equip either side with a group structure, nor does it assert a `MulEquiv` or group isomorphism. Therefore, it fails to capture the “group isomorphic” part; it only states a set-level bijection.
- Additionally, the identifier `SO2` is not Mathlib’s `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` of 2×2 real matrices; it is instead explicitly defined as the image of the rotation parameterization. While in 2D this set coincides with SO(2) set-theoretically, the use of an ad hoc subtype instead of Mathlib’s standard group structure is a red flag regarding faithfulness to “matrix group.”
- The target “group of rotations of ℝ²” is also modeled as a set of functions without group structure. No composition is specified, and no group axioms are provided.

Final comparison:
- Original: a group isomorphism between the matrix group SO(2) and the group of plane rotations.
- Lean: a type equivalence (bijection) between the set of rotation matrices and the set of rotation functions. No group structures, hence no group isomorphism.
- Conclusion: Not faithful. The core mathematical meaning (group isomorphism) is not captured; it is weakened to a set-level bijection.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Definition: `rho_theta (θ : ℝ) (X : ℝ × ℝ)` is defined by decomposing `X` into `(x, y)` and returning `(x * Real.cos θ - y * Real.sin θ, x * Real.sin θ + y * Real.cos θ)`. This is exactly multiplication of the vector `(x, y)` by the 2x2 rotation matrix `[ [cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ] ]`.
- The theorem `rotation_of_R2 (θ : ℝ) (X : ℝ × ℝ)` states: There exist real numbers `r, φ` with `0 ≤ r`, such that `X = (r * cos φ, r * sin φ)` (polar form of `X`) and `rho_theta θ X = (r * cos (φ + θ), r * sin (φ + θ))`. This claims that applying `rho_theta` adds `θ` to the angle in polar coordinates, leaving the radius `r` unchanged.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines `ρ_θ(X)` via the rotation matrix `R_θ` and asks to show that this map is a rotation through angle `θ` about the origin. The Lean definition of `rho_theta` matches the matrix multiplication formula exactly.
- The theorem captures precisely the geometric content: for any `X`, expressing `X` in polar coordinates as `(r cos φ, r sin φ)` with `r ≥ 0`, the image under `rho_theta` is `(r cos(φ+θ), r sin(φ+θ))`, i.e., the angle increases by `θ` and the radius is preserved. That is exactly “rotate by angle `θ` about the origin.”
- The inclusion of the existence of polar coordinates is standard and does not deviate from the intended meaning. The theorem is thus a faithful formalization of the given statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `rho_theta` is a legitimate definition.
- No extraneous or weaker statements are introduced. The theorem is appropriately quantified over all `θ` and `X`, and the conclusion is the standard polar-coordinate characterization of rotation about the origin by `θ`.
- There is no mismatch in domains or structures (`ℝ × ℝ` correctly represents `ℝ^2`).
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task; only the statement matters.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The theorem statement: For any natural number n with 2 ≤ n, there exists a permutation sigma on Fin n such that the subgroup generated by the set {Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n (by decide) 0), sigma} equals the whole permutation group on Fin n.
- Intended meaning: They want to express that S_n is generated by a transposition and an n-cycle. However, the code does not constrain sigma to be an n-cycle at all; it only asserts existence of some sigma that, together with a purported transposition, generates the group.
- Technical issues: Equiv.swap requires two arguments (two elements of Fin n), but the code supplies only one: Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n (by decide) 0). As written, this is ill-typed (a red flag for faithfulness/precision). Also, Fin.ofNat with those arguments is suspect in mathlib; typically one uses (0 : Fin n) and (1 : Fin n) when n ≥ 2. Even granting intent, the expression does not specify the second element of the transposition.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- Original: For n ≥ 2, the symmetric group S_n is generated by exactly the two specific elements S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,…,n)}.
- Lean theorem: There exists some sigma (no constraints) such that the subgroup generated by {swap(?,?), sigma} is all of S_n.
- Differences:
  - The Lean statement is existential in sigma; the original fixes the second generator to be the specific n-cycle (1 2 … n). The Lean theorem does not enforce sigma to be the n-cycle, or even to be an n-cycle at all.
  - The transposition is not properly specified. Even if we charitably read Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat … 0) as intending (0 1), the second argument is missing in code; moreover, the original uses (1,2) in 1-based indexing and the specific n-cycle (1 2 … n). A faithful Lean translation would explicitly use (0 1) and the specific cycle (0 1 … n-1) on Fin n, not merely existence of some sigma.
  - Because the code does not pin down sigma to the standard n-cycle, it proves a strictly weaker statement.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- The mathematical meaning is different: the original asserts that a specific pair of permutations generates S_n; the Lean code asserts the existence of some permutation sigma (unspecified) such that together with a (not even well-specified) swap, they generate S_n. This is weaker and not faithful.
- Additional red flag: The code seems not to use correct mathlib constructors for the transposition; the set literal contains a partially applied Equiv.swap, which is not a permutation, suggesting the code as written would not even compile.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

- With no Lean code, there is no formalization of GL(n), SL(n), normality, determinant, kernel, quotient, or isomorphism. Therefore, the provided “code” does not capture any part of the statement.

- lemma elements_are_units_G {X} : X ∈ G → IsUnit X: Every element of G is invertible in the ambient ring of 4×4 matrices (i.e., lies in GL_4(F)).

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
Original: ""Verify that G is a matrix group under multiplication."" Typically, this means: G contains the identity, is closed under multiplication, and is closed under inverses (so G is a subgroup of GL_4(F)).

The code provides:
- identity in G (one_mem_G) ✓
- closure under multiplication (mul_closed_G) ✓
- elements are units (invertible) in the ambient matrix ring (elements_are_units_G) — this shows G ⊆ GL_4(F) but does not assert that inverses lie in G. ✗

To verify that G is a group under multiplication, it is necessary to show that if X ∈ G then X^{-1} ∈ G. The lemma elements_are_units_G is insufficient: it shows the inverse exists in Mat_4(F) but not that it remains in the set G. A classic counterpattern: a subset S may consist only of invertible elements but still fail to contain inverses (e.g., positive rationals > 1 in (Q^×,·)). Therefore, the code does not include the critical closure-under-inverses property.

Additionally, the code does not package these properties into a subgroup structure (e.g., a Subgroup of Matrix ...), nor does it state an inv_mem_G lemma. Thus it does not fully verify that G is a ""matrix group"" under multiplication.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Set G in the code exactly matches the set in the statement (block form and det(AC) ≠ 0). Good.
- The goal ""is a matrix group under multiplication"" requires closure under inverses within G; the code only asserts invertibility in the ambient ring, not inverse membership. Hence the translation is incomplete and not faithful to the full statement.

No vacuous definitions are present; G is legitimately defined. However, the final assertions do not fully match the natural-language requirement of group structure because they omit inverse-closure.

Conclusion: Not faithful. Almost correct but missing a crucial property.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Polynomial IntermediateField: Bring in mathlib and open relevant namespaces for polynomials and intermediate fields.
- theorem isSolvable_iff_isRadical_tac_1513 (p : ℚ[X]) (hp : Irreducible p) : IsSolvable p.Gal ↔ IsRadical p := by sorry
  Natural language: For a polynomial p with rational coefficients, assuming p is irreducible, the Galois group p.Gal is solvable if and only if p is ""radical"" (as expressed by the predicate IsRadical p). Proof is omitted.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the original statement.
Original statement: Let p(x) be an irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients, and let G = Gal(p) be its Galois group. Then the complex roots of p(x) are expressible in terms of radicals if and only if G is a solvable group.

- Left-hand side: IsSolvable p.Gal — This matches “G is a solvable group,” assuming p.Gal denotes the Galois group of the splitting field of p over ℚ (which is standard in mathlib), so this part is fine.
- Right-hand side: IsRadical p — This is problematic. In mathlib, “IsRadical” is a predicate typically applied to ideals (Ideal.IsRadical) or similar algebraic structures, not to a polynomial to mean “its roots are expressible by radicals.” The established concept in mathlib for solvability by radicals of a polynomial is along the lines of “SolvableByRadicals” (e.g., SolvableByRadicals ℚ p or similar predicates involving radical extensions), not IsRadical p. Thus, the code uses a predicate that does not represent “the complex roots of p(x) are expressible in terms of radicals.”
- Furthermore, the original statement explicitly references complex roots and expression by radicals. The Lean statement does not quantify over ℂ or discuss expressions by radicals; it simply asserts IsRadical p, which is neither standard nor clearly connected to radicals in this context.

Step 3: Final check on equivalence.
The two statements are not the same. The left side (IsSolvable p.Gal) matches the solvability of the Galois group. The right side (IsRadical p) does not match the intended “solvable by radicals” notion for p’s roots. It uses a predicate that, in mathlib, has a different meaning (if it even typechecks meaningfully for polynomials). The correct mathlib predicate should involve solvability by radicals over ℚ, not IsRadical p.

Additional guideline checks:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; that’s fine.
- However, the code fails guideline 2 (using appropriate mathlib terms). The predicate IsRadical p is not the standard or correct mathlib notion for “expressible by radicals,” making the translation unfaithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Grade rationale: The left side correctly captures “G is solvable,” but the right side uses an incorrect predicate that does not mean “expressible by radicals.” That’s a substantial semantic error, so it’s not “almost the same.” No vacuous definitions are made. A fair score is 4.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: We are using Mathlib's standard library.
- Comment: ""Addition formulas for sine and cosine."" — labels the content.
- `theorem cos_add (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : Real.cos (θ1 + θ2) = Real.cos θ1 * Real.cos θ2 - Real.sin θ1 * Real.sin θ2 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For all real numbers θ1 and θ2, cos(θ1 + θ2) = cos θ1 cos θ2 − sin θ1 sin θ2. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.
- `theorem sin_add (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : Real.sin (θ1 + θ2) = Real.sin θ1 * Real.cos θ2 + Real.cos θ1 * Real.sin θ2 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For all real numbers θ1 and θ2, sin(θ1 + θ2) = sin θ1 cos θ2 + cos θ1 sin θ2. Again, proof omitted.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement asks for the addition formulas for sine and cosine, valid for all real θ1, θ2. The Lean code states exactly these two formulas as theorems, universally quantified over θ1, θ2 : ℝ. There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; the statements themselves are standard and accurate. While the prompt mentions a ""conceptual derivation (i.e., a proof)"", our auditing criterion is whether the code translates the statement, not whether it provides the proof. The theorems' statements match exactly.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same or different?
- Original: Prove the two addition formulas for sin and cos for all real angles. 
- Lean: States exactly those two formulas for all real θ1, θ2. 
No differences in content or scope. Presenting as two theorems rather than a single bundled statement is fine. The absence of proof is acceptable for translation purposes under the given auditing rules. No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib; neutral.
- Comment explains intent: represent rotation r by a 2x2 rotation matrix and reflection h across the x-axis, and state r * h * r = h.
- `open Matrix` and `noncomputable section`: stylistic; neutral.
- `def rotation_matrix (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := !![Real.cos θ, -Real.sin θ; Real.sin θ, Real.cos θ]`: Defines the standard 2×2 real rotation matrix by angle θ. This faithfully represents the rotation by angle θ.
- `def reflection_x : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := !![1, 0; 0, -1]`: Defines reflection across the x-axis (horizontal axis) as the diagonal matrix diag(1, −1). This is the standard reflection matrix across the horizontal axis.
- `theorem dihedral_rhr_eq_h (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 3) : let r := rotation_matrix (2 * Real.pi / (n : ℝ)) let h := reflection_x r * h * r = h := by sorry`: States that for a natural number n with n ≥ 3, if we set r equal to the rotation matrix by angle 2π/n and h equal to the reflection across the x-axis, then the matrix identity r * h * r = h holds. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we only audit the statement.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: Define r as rotation by 2π/n and h as reflection across the horizontal axis in the context of the dihedral group, and prove r h r = h using matrices. The Lean code defines exactly those matrices and asserts the matrix equality r * h * r = h. This matches the requested algebraic (matrix) formulation.
- The hypothesis n ≥ 3 appears in both the NL statement and the Lean theorem. It is not essential for the matrix identity, but it matches the given context and does not weaken or change the claim.
- The code does not define the dihedral group D_n per se, but the NL instruction explicitly asks for a matrix argument, so expressing and proving the matrix identity suffices as a faithful translation.
- No auxiliary definitions are vacuous: both `rotation_matrix` and `reflection_x` are concrete and correct.
- The statement order and content align: r is rotation by 2π/n, h is reflection across the horizontal axis, and the goal is the identity r h r = h.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement directly encodes the desired matrix identity with the specified r and h. There are no misleading or placeholder definitions, and no missing hypotheses relevant to the identity. The extra context of D_n is not modeled, but the NL request is to use matrices, which is precisely what the Lean code does.
- Minor note: the assumption n ≥ 3 is included but unused; this does not harm faithfulness.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We work in a fixed group G.
- `theorem internal_direct_product_disjoint {n : Nat} (H : Fin n → Subgroup G) (m : (∀ i, H i) → G) (h_inj : Function.Injective m) : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → ((H i : Set G) ∩ (H j : Set G) = ({1} : Set G)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Given a family of subgroups H indexed by Fin n, and a function m from the product type (∀ i, H i) to G that is injective, then for any distinct indices i ≠ j, the intersection (as sets) of H i and H j equals the singleton set {1}. No further assumptions (e.g., that m is the multiplication map, or that each H i is normal) are present.

2) Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If G is the internal direct product of normal subgroups H1, ..., Hn, then for any i ≠ j, Hi ∩ Hj = {1}.
- Key missing/incorrect parts in the Lean statement:
  - Internal direct product is not encoded. In particular, there is no statement that the multiplication map from the external product of the H i into G is a bijection (or at least injective and surjective). The code merely assumes an arbitrary function m : (∀ i, H i) → G with injectivity, with no relation to multiplication in G. This is a major mismatch: one cannot draw conclusions about intersections of the H i in G from an arbitrary injective function from the product of the subgroups to G unless that function is precisely the multiplication map.
  - Normality of the subgroups H i is not assumed. While normality is not needed to prove pairwise trivial intersections from injectivity of the multiplication map, the original hypothesis explicitly includes normality as part of “internal direct product of normal subgroups.” This is not reflected in the code.
  - No surjectivity or generation assumptions are present. Internal direct product entails that the multiplication map is surjective (G is the product of the H i), which is missing here.
  - The function m is completely unconstrained; it is not even stated to be the multiplication map. The docstring suggests it encodes “uniqueness of decomposition,” but the formal statement does not tie m to the group structure.
- The conclusion format: The code asserts set-level equality (H i) ∩ (H j) = {1}, which is compatible with the intended result (trivial intersection). That part is fine.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The Lean code does not faithfully translate the original statement. It replaces the hypothesis “G is the internal direct product of the H i (normal subgroups)” with a much weaker and largely unrelated assumption: existence of an arbitrary injective function from the product of the H i to G. There is no formal link to the group’s multiplication, no normality, and no internal direct product structure. Thus the two statements are different.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present, but the key structural assumption is missing/misstated.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the various `open` lines: bring in Mathlib and namespaces; they are not central to the statement.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem orthogonal_columns (n : ℕ) (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) (h : A.transpose * A = 1) : ∀ i j : Fin n, ∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j = if i = j then 1 else 0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a natural number n and a real n×n matrix A, assume Aᵀ A = I (the identity matrix). Then for all indices i, j in {0, …, n-1}, the sum over k of A_{k i} * A_{k j} equals 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise.
  Here, `A k i` denotes the entry of A in row k and column i; `∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j` is the standard Euclidean dot product of the i-th and j-th columns of A; `if i = j then 1 else 0` is the Kronecker delta δ_{ij}. The hypothesis `h : A.transpose * A = 1` is precisely the orthogonality condition characterizing O(n) over ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Let A ∈ O(n) with column vectors A₁,…,Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ. Show that Aᵢ·Aⱼ = δ_{ij} for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.
- Lean: Assumes AᵀA = I (i.e., A ∈ O(n)), and concludes that the dot product (expressed as a sum over k of componentwise products) of the i-th and j-th columns is δ_{ij}.
- Indexing: Lean uses `Fin n` (0,…,n-1) while the statement uses 1,…,n; this is a harmless notational difference.
- Dot product: Expressed explicitly as a sum; this matches the standard dot product on ℝⁿ.
- δ_{ij}: Expressed as `if i = j then 1 else 0`.
Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check and potential red flags:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a standard orthogonality hypothesis.
- Using `A.transpose * A = 1` is the standard definition of membership in O(n) over ℝ.
- The absence of a proof (`by sorry`) is acceptable for this auditing task; we only check the statement's faithfulness.

- theorem rho_add (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : (rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2) = rho (θ1 + θ2): States that composing rotations by θ1 and θ2 equals rotation by θ1 + θ2. Here ∘ is function composition, so this matches the usual convention (apply ρ_{θ2} then ρ_{θ1}).
- theorem rho_inverse_comp (θ : ℝ) : (rho θ) ∘ (rho (-θ)) = id ∧ (rho (-θ)) ∘ (rho θ) = id: States that ρ_{-θ} is a two-sided inverse of ρ_θ, i.e., both compositions yield the identity function on R^2. This encodes that (ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{-θ} in functional terms.
- theorem rho_comm (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : (rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2) = (rho θ2) ∘ (rho θ1): States that rotations commute.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original says: For all θ, θ1, θ2 in R, we have ρ_{θ1} ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2} and (ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{-θ}. In particular, rotations commute. The Lean code defines ρ_θ as a function on R^2 and then states exactly these properties: composition corresponds to angle addition, inverse corresponds to negation of angle (expressed via two-sided inverse equalities), and commutativity of rotations. This is mathematically equivalent to the natural language statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Quantification is correct via parameters (θ, θ1, θ2 : ℝ).
- Composition is represented as ∘, which aligns with ρ_{θ1} ρ_{θ2} in standard notation.
- The inverse property is expressed via two equalities to id, which is equivalent to saying (ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{-θ} for bijections; since both-sided inverse equalities are stated, this suffices.
- No vacuous placeholders or misleading auxiliary definitions are present. The definition of rotation is the genuine standard formula.
- The “in particular” statement is given directly as a theorem; it follows from rho_add as well (since addition of reals is commutative), but stating it explicitly is fine and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- The shift from “integer n > 1” to “natural n with 1 < n” is a standard, faithful formalization: an integer n > 1 is a positive integer and thus canonically a natural number greater than 1. The added hypothesis `1 < n` matches the NL assumption and is not weaker.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. The absence of proofs (`sorry`) is acceptable for this task since we only check translation of statements.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorems exactly state the two distributivity identities for the congruence classes in ZMod n, for all integers a, b, c, with n > 1. No mismatches or omissions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `theorem s5_not_solvable ( h : IsSimpleGroup (MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign : Equiv.Perm (Fin 5) →* ℤˣ) : Type _)) : ¬ IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem. The hypothesis `h` is that the kernel of the sign homomorphism from the symmetric group on 5 letters, `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)`, to the units of the integers, `ℤˣ`, is a simple group. The kernel of the sign map is precisely the subgroup of even permutations, i.e., the alternating group A5. The conclusion is `¬ IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm (Fin 5))`, i.e., S5 is not solvable.

Assessment:
- The natural language statement says: Assume A5 is simple; show S5 is not solvable. The code encodes exactly this: it assumes `IsSimpleGroup` of the kernel of the sign hom (which is A5) and concludes non-solvability of `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` (which is S5).
- Using `ℤˣ` for the sign hom is standard; its kernel equals A5. Treating the kernel as a type with group structure is standard in Mathlib (the kernel is a subgroup and thus a group via CoeeSort). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; just a theorem statement with a proof hole, which is acceptable per the task.
- The conclusion matches the original claim. The hypothesis matches the assumption that A5 is simple. No extraneous assumptions or mismatches.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No differences found.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: G is a type with a Group structure; n : ℕ; F is a type with a Field structure. This matches the setup: a group G, a natural number n, and a field F.
- def perm_matrix (p : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F := fun i j => if p i = j then 1 else 0. This defines the permutation matrix over F associated to a permutation p of n elements (indexed by Fin n). This is a standard definition of a permutation matrix.

This asserts that given a monoid hom δ from G to the symmetric group on n letters (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), there exists a monoid hom ρ from G to the monoid of n×n matrices over F such that for all g in G, ρ g equals the permutation matrix associated to δ g. The proof is omitted (sorry), but for our auditing we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “Any permutation representation δ: G → S_n gives rise to a matrix representation ρ: G → GL_n(F) by sending g to the permutation matrix P_{δ(g)}.”
- Agreement:
  - δ is modeled as a group hom into S_n: in Lean, δ : G →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n) correctly captures a group hom (→* is a monoid hom; for groups this is the standard notion of group hom in Mathlib).
  - The permutation matrix construction is explicitly given.
  - The rule ρ(g) = permutation matrix of δ(g) is exactly what is stated.
- Critical mismatch:
  - Codomain: The NL statement requires ρ : G → GL_n(F), i.e., into the general linear group (invertible matrices/linear equivalences). The Lean code’s ρ has codomain Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F, the monoid of all n×n matrices, not the group of invertible ones. It does not express that ρ(g) is invertible or that the codomain is GL_n(F). This is a substantive difference: the object constructed in the NL statement is a group representation into GL_n(F), while the code only asserts a monoid hom into all matrices.
  - The code never mentions GeneralLinearGroup (or GL) nor restricts to invertible matrices. Even though permutation matrices are invertible, the statement’s target group is not reflected in the Lean theorem type.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem claims the existence of a monoid hom ρ : G →* Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F with ρ(g) equal to the associated permutation matrix. The original statement asserts a group hom into GL_n(F). The codomain mismatch is essential; the Lean code weakens the statement by not targeting GL_n(F) and not encoding that the images are units/invertible (or linear equivalences). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.
- Minor note: The custom perm_matrix is fine and faithful as a definition. Also, using →* for δ is fine. The main issue is the incorrect codomain for ρ.

Grade rationale: Major semantic mismatch (GL_n(F) vs all matrices). No vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definition is legitimate. Hence not completely off, but not faithful. A harsh but fair score is 4.

  2) ∃ n : ℕ, n ≥ 5 ∧ Nonempty (G ≃ AlternatingGroup n)
  3) IsSimpleGroupOfLieType G
  4) IsSporadicSimpleGroup G
  with no proof.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the original statement?
Original statement (CFSG): Every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of the following: (1) a cyclic group of prime order; (2) an alternating group of degree ≥ 5; (3) a simple group of Lie type (including classical types PSL, PSU, PSp, PO over finite fields and the exceptional/twisted including Tits); (4) one of the 26 sporadic simple groups.

Issues:
- Massive use of placeholders/axioms for core concepts:
  • AlternatingGroup is an axiomatically introduced type with no Group instance, not Mathlib’s real alternating group object. This violates the guideline to use Mathlib’s notions and is a red flag.
  • IsSimpleGroupOfLieType and IsSporadicSimpleGroup are uninterpreted predicates. They do not faithfully encode the definitions (no content linking to classical/exceptional/twisted families or the precise list of 26 sporadics). This is vacuous.
- Incorrect notion of isomorphism in case (2): They use Nonempty (G ≃ AlternatingGroup n), which is a type equivalence, not a group isomorphism. The correct notion should be Nonempty (G ≃* H) for groups H. Since AlternatingGroup n has no [Group] instance here, even a group isomorphism cannot be stated as-is. This is not faithful.
- Case (1) only asserts prime order, not isomorphism to a cyclic group: The code says Fintype.card G = p (with p prime). The classification requires “isomorphic to a cyclic group of prime order.” While it is true that a finite group of prime order is cyclic, the statement as written does not claim an isomorphism to a standard cyclic group (e.g., ZMod p or a canonical cyclic group of size p), so it is not a faithful translation of the stated classification.
- Cases (3) and (4) are too vague and not tied to explicit families or the list of 26 sporadics: The classification says “isomorphic to” a group in specified families or listed sporadics; the code instead asserts a property of G (IsSimpleGroupOfLieType G ∨ IsSporadicSimpleGroup G) without providing definitions or explicit isomorphisms. Even if one allowed a property that encodes “isomorphic to one of X,” here it is not defined; thus it is vacuous.
- Not using Mathlib’s existing concepts: There exist standard objects for alternating groups and cyclic groups (ZMod p or Cyclic groups), and group isomorphism is ≃*. The code avoids these and introduces ad-hoc axioms.

Step 3: Final comparison of the two math statements
- Original: “is isomorphic to one of the following groups …” with explicit families and the 26 sporadics.
- Lean code: A disjunction of four conditions, three of which are asserted via either cardinality only (not isomorphism) or via uninterpreted predicates, and one via type equivalence (≃) rather than group isomorphism (≃*), and using an ad-hoc AlternatingGroup with no structure.
Differences:
- Not stating isomorphisms for cases (1), (3), (4).
- Using type equivalence instead of group isomorphism in case (2).
- AlternatingGroup is an undefined axiom rather than the Mathlib alternating group; no group structure provided.
- Lie type and sporadic cases are vacuous predicates, not definitions that enumerate or specify the families.
- The inclusion of classical vs exceptional/twisted subfamilies is not reflected at all.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. It relies on vacuous axioms, uses the wrong notion of isomorphism for groups, and fails to connect to Mathlib’s definitions. Even if those placeholders were replaced by meaningful definitions, the first and second disjuncts as written would still be incorrect (cardinality vs cyclic isomorphism; ≃ vs ≃*), so additional fixes would be needed.

Grade rationale: Multiple critical issues: vacuous placeholders, wrong isomorphism notion, and missing isomorphism to cyclic groups. Therefore, not faithful. According to the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful,” so a low grade (around 3) is appropriate.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement asserts a group isomorphism between S_n and the subgroup of GL_n(F) consisting of permutation matrices, via α ↦ P_α. This involves: (1) the codomain being a subgroup of GL_n(F), (2) asserting invertibility (membership in GL_n(F)), and (3) the map being a group isomorphism (homomorphism and bijection).
- The Lean code only provides a type-level bijection `Equiv` between permutations and a subtype of matrices characterized by a predicate. It does not:
  - Embed the codomain into GL_n(F) or even mention GL_n(F).
  - Show that these matrices are invertible or form a subgroup under multiplication.
  - State or prove that the map is a group homomorphism, i.e., that `perm_matrix (σ ∘ τ) = perm_matrix σ ⬝ perm_matrix τ`.
- The definition of permutation matrix via “exactly one 1 in each row and column, zeros elsewhere” is a standard equivalent characterization, so that part is acceptable. The map `perm_matrix` corresponds to “apply σ to columns of I,” which matches the intended construction.

Final check:
- The math problems are different in a crucial way: the code asserts only a bijection of sets (Equiv) while the original asserts an isomorphism of groups to a subgroup of GL_n(F). Missing are the group structure on the codomain and the homomorphism property. Also, the codomain is not stated as a subgroup of GL_n(F).
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Natural language of the statement:
Given a group G, a subgroup H, and a natural number n, assume:
- H_fintype: H is finite (there is a Fintype instance on the elements of H).
- uniq: for any subgroup K of G which is finite and has exactly n elements, K = H. In other words, H is the unique subgroup of order n (among finite subgroups, which is automatic for order n).
Conclusion:
- For every g in G, the image of H under the inner automorphism by g equals H: map (conj g) H = H. This is equivalent to H being normal in G.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement
Original: If H is a subgroup of order n in a group G and H is the only subgroup of order n, then H is normal in G.

The Lean statement captures:
- Uniqueness of subgroups of order n via uniq.
- Normality via the equivalent condition ∀ g, map (conj g) H = H.

However, it is missing a crucial assumption: that H itself has order n. The theorem assumes H is finite (H_fintype) but does not assert Fintype.card (H : Set G) = n. Without this, the uniqueness hypothesis could be vacuously true (if no subgroup has order n), and the theorem would (incorrectly) claim normality for arbitrary finite H. Thus the Lean statement is strictly weaker in hypotheses and does not faithfully encode “H is of order n”.

Minor points:
- The uniqueness hypothesis restricts to finite K via [Fintype (K : Set G)], which is fine because having order n already implies finiteness.
- The conclusion is a standard equivalent formulation of normality, so that part is faithful.

Step 3: Final check
They are not the same: the Lean code omits the assumption that H has order n. This is a substantive mismatch, making the translation not faithful.

Grade rationale: The statement is almost right but misses a key hypothesis (card H = n). No vacuous auxiliary definitions; standard Mathlib notions are used. Therefore: not faithful, but close.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: G is a group, H and K are subgroups of G, with hH : H.Normal and hK : K.Normal (i.e., H and K are normal in G), and h : H ≤ K (i.e., H is contained in K).
- Goal (conjunction):
  1) (K ⧸ H) ≤ (G ⧸ H)
  2) (G ⧸ H) ⧸ (K ⧸ H) ≃* G ⧸ K

Interpreting these:
- (1) purports to say that the quotient “K/H” is less than or equal to “G/H.” In mathlib, ≤ on subgroups denotes inclusion between subgroups of the same ambient group. However, (K ⧸ H) and (G ⧸ H) here are quotient groups (types), not subgroups of a common ambient group, so this expression does not represent the statement “K/H is a normal subgroup of G/H.” Even informally, it only resembles a bare inclusion, not normality. The natural language statement requires: (K/H) is a normal subgroup of (G/H), i.e., K/H ▹ G/H. The Lean statement does not express normality at all, and in fact uses the wrong objects: the subgroup of G/H corresponding to K is the image K.map (QuotientGroup.mk' H) (a Subgroup of G ⧸ H), not the quotient group type K ⧸ H.
- (2) tries to assert the third isomorphism: (G/H)/(K/H) ≃* G/K. But again, the inner “(K ⧸ H)” must be a Subgroup of (G ⧸ H) (specifically the image of K in the quotient), not the quotient group type K ⧸ H. As written, it uses the wrong object on the right of ⧸, so it does not faithfully state the standard third isomorphism theorem in mathlib terms.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement has two parts:
  (i) If H ▹ G, K ▹ G, and H ⊆ K then K/H ▹ G/H (normality in the quotient).
  (ii) (G/H)/(K/H) ≅ G/K.
- The Lean theorem fails to state (i) correctly: it gives an inclusion (≤) between two quotient groups (which is not the right kind of object and omits normality). It should instead assert that the image of K in G/H is a normal Subgroup of G/H.
- The Lean theorem also fails to state (ii) correctly: the subgroup in the middle quotient must be the image of K in G/H, not the separate quotient type K ⧸ H.

Final check:
- The two problems are not the same. The Lean statement does not faithfully represent normality for K/H in G/H and uses the wrong objects for the middle subgroup in the third isomorphism. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- The code is thematically related but fundamentally incorrect in both parts. It neither states normality nor uses the correct mathlib constructions for the subgroup of G/H, so it significantly diverges from the intended statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation and sanity check
- import Mathlib: OK, brings in the library.
- Comment: States the mathematical goal: show SO(n) is normal in O(n) and O(n)/SO(n) ≅ Z^× = {±1}. That matches the natural language statement in intent.
- variable (n : ℕ): Introduces n.
- def O_group := LinearIsometryEquiv.ofReal (Fin n → ℝ) -- placeholder
  • Intended: define the orthogonal group O(n) over ℝ.
  • Actual: This is a placeholder and does not define the orthogonal group. Moreover, LinearIsometryEquiv.ofReal is not an appropriate constructor for the orthogonal group; it isn’t a type of group elements and likely not even a valid term here. In mathlib, the correct object is OrthogonalGroup (Fin n) ℝ (or OrthogonalGroup n ℝ with n a type), a type with a Group structure. This definition is both nonstandard and almost certainly ill-typed.
- def SO_group := {g : O_group n // 1 = 1} -- placeholder
  • Intended: define the special orthogonal group SO(n) as the subgroup of O(n) with determinant 1.
  • Actual: This defines a subtype of O_group n consisting of elements together with a proof of 1 = 1, i.e., the trivial condition; hence SO_group n is (noncanonically) equivalent to O_group n itself. Crucially, it is not a Subgroup of O_group n. It does not encode det = 1 or any meaningful restriction.
- theorem SO_normal_in_O : (SO_group n).Normal := by sorry
  • Intended: SO(n) is normal in O(n).
  • Actual: (SO_group n).Normal expects SO_group n to be a Subgroup of some group, since Normal is a predicate on Subgroup G. Here SO_group n is just a type (a subtype), not a Subgroup, so this is ill-typed. Also there is no group structure attached to O_group n.
- theorem O_mod_SO_eq_units : (O_group n) ⧸ (SO_group n) ≃* (Multiplicative (Units (Int))) := by sorry
  • Intended: O(n)/SO(n) ≅ Z^×.
  • Actual: The quotient G ⧸ N requires G to be a Group and N a Normal Subgroup of G. Neither is provided: O_group n is not a group here, and SO_group n is not a Subgroup. Moreover, Multiplicative (Units Int) is unnecessary/wrong; Units Int already carries a multiplicative group structure, so wrapping in Multiplicative is inappropriate. In mathlib one would state ≃* Units ℤ.

Step 2: Compare the overall meaning to the natural language statement
- The natural language asks: prove SO(n) ◁ O(n) and O(n)/SO(n) ≅ Z^×. The code attempts to assert analogous theorems, but all core definitions are placeholders or incorrect: O_group is not the orthogonal group; SO_group is defined by a vacuous condition and not as a subgroup; the quotient and normality are ill-typed. The theorems are left as sorry.
- Therefore, the code does not faithfully formalize the statement.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. Key discrepancies:
  • O_group is not the orthogonal group from mathlib; it’s a nonsensical placeholder.
  • SO_group is not a subgroup defined by det = 1; it’s the entire O_group n with a trivial proof attached.
  • Normality is stated for a non-Subgroup, hence ill-typed.
  • The quotient is taken of a non-group by a non-subgroup, hence ill-typed.
  • Target group is written as Multiplicative (Units Int) instead of Units ℤ.
- Auxiliary definitions are vacuous/incorrect, violating the guideline against vacuous placeholders.

Conclusion: The code is not a legitimate, faithful translation; it would not even typecheck in mathlib as written, and it does not use the appropriate mathlib notions (OrthogonalGroup, SpecialOrthogonalGroup, determinant, Subgroup.normal, group quotient, Units ℤ).

theorem partition_generating_function : True := by sorry
",0,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library. Neutral.
- Docstring: Describes the intended theorem about the generating function for the partition numbers p(n): sum_{n=0}^∞ p(n) x^n = ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x^k)^{-1}. However, comments do not affect the formal statement.
- `theorem partition_generating_function : True := by sorry`: The only formal statement is that `True` holds, with the proof omitted by `sorry`. This is a vacuous theorem; it makes no reference to partitions, generating functions, sums, products, or any formal power series structure.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The original statement asserts a precise identity of generating functions for the partition function p(n): an equality of formal power series (or analytic series) ∑ p(n) x^n = ∏ (1 - x^k)^{-1}. The Lean code does not state anything remotely close to this; it merely states `True`. The content from the docstring is not encoded in the theorem type. There are no definitions or hypotheses about p, x, or infinite products/sums.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The Lean theorem is entirely unrelated to the mathematical claim. There are no auxiliary definitions; the only statement is vacuous (`True`) and thus fails the translation requirements.

Conclusion: The translation fails completely. Grade should reflect that it is unrelated and vacuous.

- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := R_theta θ`: Defines ρ_θ to be exactly R_θ. This matches the natural language “ρ_θ(X) = R_θ X”.
- `theorem rho_fix_origin (θ : ℝ) : rho θ (0,0) = (0,0) := by sorry`: States that for any real θ, applying ρ_θ to the origin (0,0) yields (0,0), i.e., the origin is fixed by the rotation.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The NL statement: For every θ ∈ ℝ, the rotation operator ρ_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2, defined by ρ_θ(X) = R_θ X, fixes the origin. The code defines ρ_θ as R_θ via the standard rotation formula, and the theorem asserts ρ_θ(0,0) = (0,0) for arbitrary θ. This is precisely the same content.

3) Final check and differences:
- Quantification: The theorem is stated with θ as a parameter, which in Lean is equivalent to ∀ θ, ρ θ (0,0) = (0,0). Matches “for every θ”.
- Definitions: No vacuous placeholders; R_theta is a genuine rotation map, rho is exactly R_theta. No auxiliary fake definitions.
- Domain/codomain: ℝ × ℝ represents ℝ^2; consistent with the statement.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem orthogonal_columns {n : Nat} (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real) (h : Matrix.transpose A * A = 1) :` 
  This states: Let A be an n×n real matrix, and assume A^T A = I (the identity matrix). This is exactly the defining property of an orthogonal matrix, i.e., A ∈ O(n).
- `∀ i j : Fin n, (∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j) = if i = j then 1 else 0` 
  For all indices i, j (columns) from 0 to n−1 (Fin n), the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. Interpreting A k i as the k-th component of the i-th column, the left-hand side is precisely the dot product of column i with column j. The right-hand side is the Kronecker delta δ_ij, expressed as `if i = j then 1 else 0`.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For A ∈ O(n) with column vectors A_1, ..., A_n ∈ R^n, show that A_i^T A_j = δ_ij for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. 
- The Lean hypothesis `Matrix.transpose A * A = 1` is exactly the condition A ∈ O(n) (orthogonality) over the reals.
- The conclusion in Lean states the dot product of columns i and j equals δ_ij, in coordinate form: `∑_k A_{k i} A_{k j} = δ_ij`. This matches the claim that A_i^T A_j = δ_ij.
- Indexing via `Fin n` vs. 1..n is a harmless convention difference; the sets are in bijection.
- δ_ij is represented as `if i = j then 1 else 0`, which is standard in Lean.

No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are present; the theorem directly states the desired relationship under the correct orthogonality hypothesis. The Mathlib constructs used (Matrix, transpose, Fin, BigOperators) are standard and appropriate.

Final check: The Lean code statement and the natural language statement are mathematically the same. There are no discrepancies.

- noncomputable def H0 : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...: Defines a 2×2 real matrix H0 with entries given by cases on i,j ∈ {0,1}. Evaluating the cases yields H0 = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. This matches H_0 = [[1,0],[0,-1]].
- noncomputable def R (φ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...: Defines the 2×2 real rotation matrix R(φ) with entries [[cos φ, -sin φ], [sin φ, cos φ]]. This matches R_φ as stated.

- theorem H_theta_eq (θ : ℝ) : H θ = H0 * R (-2 * θ) := by sorry: States the equality H(θ) = H0 · R(−2θ) for each real θ (proof omitted). Matrix multiplication is the usual one.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
Natural statement: For each θ ∈ ℝ, H_θ = H_0 R_{−2θ}, where H_0 = [[1,0],[0,−1]] and R_φ = [[cos φ, −sin φ],[sin φ, cos φ]].
- H0 and R in Lean exactly match the given definitions of H_0 and R_φ.
- The theorem H_theta_eq asserts exactly H(θ) = H0 * R(−2θ) for all θ.
- The Lean code additionally gives an explicit formula for H(θ) as [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), −cos(2θ)]], which is in fact equal to H0 R(−2θ) by direct multiplication and trig parity (cos even, sin odd). This extra definition is consistent and not a placeholder; it does not change the meaning of the claimed equality.

3) Final check for differences:
- Dimensions, entries, and signs in H0 and R match exactly.
- The parameter in R is −2θ (Lean writes −2 * θ), which is the same.
- The statement covers ""for each θ""; the Lean theorem is universally quantified in θ.
- No vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are concrete and faithful.
- Therefore, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  Translation: For any integer n with n > 0 and integers a, b, c, if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n). This states transitivity.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c ∈ ℤ. Prove: (i) a ≡ a (mod n), (ii) if a ≡ b (mod n) then b ≡ a (mod n), (iii) if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n) then a ≡ c (mod n).
- The Lean theorems precisely state these three properties using Int.ModEq, the standard Mathlib predicate for integer congruence modulo n. The hypotheses include 0 < n (matching “positive integer”), and a, b, c are integers. Each property is separated into a theorem, which is fine.
- No auxiliary or vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given with standard Mathlib notation. The use of Int for the modulus together with hn : 0 < n matches “positive integer n.”

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statements exactly capture reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of congruence modulo a positive integer n over ℤ. The presence of hn is consistent with the natural-language assumption that n is positive. There are no extraneous assumptions or missing parts.

- The natural language statement: O(2) = {R_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} ∪ {H_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}, with R_θ as the rotation matrix and H_θ the reflection across the line through the origin at angle θ.
- The Lean code defines R_θ exactly as the usual rotation matrix.
- The Lean code defines H_θ by the standard explicit formula for reflection across the line at angle θ. This matches the description.
- The theorem equates the set of orthogonal 2×2 real matrices to the union of these two families, exactly the content of the statement. The use of Matrix.orthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ coerced to a Set of matrices is the correct formalization of O(2).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; R and H are fully specified, and the theorem statement is exactly the classification claim.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- LHS: O(2) in the code matches the intended O(2) (orthogonal group of 2×2 real matrices).
- RHS: Union of all rotations and all reflections as matrices; parameters θ ∈ ℝ. The reflection definition matches the geometric description.
- No extra conditions (e.g., determinants) are incorrectly added or omitted; the classification is stated exactly.
- Thus the two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

2) Does this match the natural language statement? The statement asks to show that the rotation matrix R_θ belongs to SO(2) for every θ ∈ ℝ. In standard linear algebra over ℝ, membership in SO(2) is equivalently characterized by two conditions: orthogonality (AᵀA = I) and determinant 1. The theorem asserts exactly these two properties for R(θ), for arbitrary θ. Thus the theorem is a faithful formalization of “R_θ ∈ SO(2) for all θ”.

- The matrix defined is exactly the intended rotation matrix.
- The property “R ∈ SO(2)” is expressed by the conjunction (RᵀR = I) ∧ (det R = 1), which is mathematically equivalent.
- The quantification over all θ is present via the argument (θ : ℝ) of the theorem.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary definition R is correct and non-vacuous. Although the proof is omitted (by sorry), this is acceptable for translation auditing.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem maximum_modulus_principle_local {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U)`: Let U be a subset of ℂ and assume U is open.
- `{f : ℂ → ℂ} (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: Let f be a function from ℂ to ℂ which is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- `{z0 : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U)`: Fix a point z0 in U.
- `(hmax : IsLocalMax (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) z0)`: Assume that the function z ↦ |f z| has a local maximum at z0 (in the ambient space ℂ, not restricted to U).
- Conclusion: `∃ s : Set ℂ, IsOpen s ∧ z0 ∈ s ∧ s ⊆ U ∧ ∀ z ∈ s, f z = f z0` meaning there exists an open neighborhood s of z0 contained in U on which f is constant.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic; if |f| attains a local maximum at some point z0 ∈ U (local with respect to the domain U), then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.

Key differences:
1) Domain of f: The natural statement has f : U → ℂ. The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ and only assumes differentiability on U. While this is a common modeling choice, it assumes f is defined outside U, which the original statement does not require. This on its own can be acceptable if other hypotheses are phrased relative to U.
2) Local maximum predicate: The significant mismatch is using `IsLocalMax (fun z => |f z|) z0`, which asserts a local maximum in the ambient space ℂ, not relative to U. The natural statement refers to a local maximum in the domain U; in Mathlib, this should be `IsLocalMaxOn (fun z => |f z|) U z0` (together with `hz0 : z0 ∈ U`). Because U is open, local maximum in U is a strictly weaker assumption than local maximum in ℂ. Thus the Lean hypothesis is stronger than the original.
3) Conclusion: Existence of an open neighborhood s of z0 contained in U on which f is constant matches “f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.” This part is faithful.

Overall assessment:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; standard Mathlib predicates are used.
- However, the crucial hypothesis about the local maximum is too strong (global/ambient local max rather than local max relative to U). Also, the function being defined on all of ℂ rather than just U further separates it from the exact formulation, though that aspect alone might be acceptable; the local-max mismatch is decisive.

  This defines G as the set of 2×2 real matrices with entries [[a, -b], [b, a]] for some real a, b. This matches the intended G exactly.
- def G' : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := G \ {(0 : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)}:
  This defines G' as G with the zero matrix removed. This matches the intended G' exactly.
- def G'_is_group : Group (Subtype fun M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ => M ∈ G') := by sorry:
  This claims to define a Group structure on the subtype consisting of matrices in G'. However, it provides no content (uses `sorry`). Moreover, the type only states that there is some group structure on this subtype; it does not state that the group operation is the restriction of matrix multiplication. That linkage would have to be provided in the actual structure data (mul, one, inv) and proofs, which are omitted.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Define G and G', then prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The code defines G and G' faithfully, but the final item is a vacuous placeholder for a Group structure. It neither specifies nor ensures that the group law is matrix multiplication (it could, in principle, choose an arbitrary multiplication), and it provides no proof or construction. According to the auditing guidelines, any `sorry` in such a foundational definition causes the translation to fail. Additionally, the phrase ""under matrix multiplication"" is not enforced by the type—this would have to be shown by actually defining the group structure from matrix multiplication and inverses, which is not done.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- G and G' are correctly formalized.
- The crucial part—exhibiting G' as a group under matrix multiplication—is not faithfully captured: the code gives a bare existence of a group structure on the subtype with `sorry`, without tying it to matrix multiplication. This is a red flag per the guidelines and is not a faithful translation of the mathematical claim.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the `sorry` were replaced with an explicit group structure derived from matrix multiplication and inverses (and proofs that this is closed within G'), it would be faithful. As it stands, it fails the requirements.

- The first theorem states precisely the general functional equation claim: if f satisfies f(z+w) = f(z)f(w) and f(0) = 1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z.
- The second theorem states the specialization to the complex exponential, which aligns with using e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 to conclude nonvanishing.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The theorem `subgroup_closure_of_index_two {G : Type*} [Group G] (H : Subgroup G) (a : G) (h_index : H.index = 2) (ha : a ∉ H) : Subgroup.closure ((H : Set G) ∪ ({a} : Set G)) = (⊤ : Subgroup G)` states:
  In any group G, if H is a subgroup of index 2, and a is an element not in H, then the subgroup generated by H together with a is the whole group G. Formally, the subgroup closure of the set H ∪ {a} equals the top subgroup ⊤ (i.e., all of G).
- The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Step 2: Assess if it matches the natural language statement
- Natural language statement: For O(2) with subgroup SO(2) (rotations), prove that O(2) is generated by SO(2) ∪ {A} for any improper orthogonal matrix A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2).
- The Lean theorem is a general lemma: any subgroup of index 2 generates the whole group when adjoined with any element outside it.
- This general lemma does imply the specific O(2)/SO(2) claim, since SO(2) has index 2 in O(2), and an improper orthogonal matrix is precisely an element of O(2) not in SO(2). Thus, instantiating G = O(2), H = SO(2), and a = A yields the desired result.

Step 3: Final comparison — are they the same?
- Differences:
  - The Lean statement is a general group-theoretic fact about index 2 subgroups; it does not mention O(2) or SO(2) explicitly.
  - It requires the hypothesis `H.index = 2`, which is not stated in the natural language statement but is a known fact for SO(2) in O(2).
- Despite being a standard route to prove the NL statement, the code is not a direct translation of the specific O(2)/SO(2) claim; it is a general theorem that must be specialized using an external known fact.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; the concepts used (Subgroup, index, closure) are standard and appropriate. The statement is mathematically meaningful.

Conclusion: The code is very close and implies the NL statement, but it is not a literal or direct translation of the specific claim about O(2) and SO(2). Under the ""extra harsh"" guideline, this counts as not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Use mathlib.
- noncomputable section: Allows noncomputable definitions (e.g., sqrt).
- def rho (θ : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := (x.1 * cos θ - x.2 * sin θ, x.1 * sin θ + x.2 * cos θ): Defines ρ_θ on R^2 by the standard rotation matrix multiplied by x = (x1, x2).
- def inner2 (x y : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ := x.1 * y.1 + x.2 * y.2: Defines the standard Euclidean inner product on R^2.
- noncomputable def norm2 (x : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ := Real.sqrt (inner2 x x): Defines the Euclidean norm on R^2 as sqrt(x·x).
- theorem inner_rho_eq_cos (θ : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ) (hx : x ≠ (0, 0)) : inner2 x (rho θ x) = norm2 x * norm2 (rho θ x) * Real.cos θ: States that for any real θ and any nonzero vector x in R^2, the inner product of x and ρ_θ(x) equals ||x|| · ||ρ_θ(x)|| · cos θ. The comment explicitly says this expresses that the angle between x and ρ_θ(x) is θ.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language claim is: For any θ ∈ ℝ and any nonzero X ∈ ℝ^2, the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ (hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ).

The theorem in Lean asserts exactly the standard cosine-of-angle identity: x·(ρ_θ x) = ||x|| ||ρ_θ x|| cos θ for nonzero x. This is the conventional algebraic formulation of “the angle between x and ρ_θ x is θ” when angle is defined via cos(angle) = (x·y)/(||x|| ||y||). The inclusion of ||ρ_θ x|| (instead of e.g. ||x||) is appropriate and general; equality of norms under ρ_θ is true but not needed for the angle identity. The hypothesis x ≠ 0 matches the “nonzero X” requirement; and ρ_θ x ≠ 0 follows mathematically from the invertibility of ρ_θ, so the angle is well-defined for nonzero x.

There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions: rho, inner2, and norm2 are explicitly and correctly defined. No auxiliary dummy predicates are introduced. The theorem statement itself makes the exact cosine-of-angle identity. Although the code does not use mathlib’s inner product typeclasses or an explicit angle function, it faithfully redefines the necessary concepts in R^2 and states the mathematically equivalent condition.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Quantifiers: both claim ∀ θ and ∀ nonzero X. Match.
- Content: “angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ” is expressed via inner = product of norms times cos θ. Equivalent under the standard definition of angle via arccos, which is the conventional meaning.
- No extraneous/vacuous definitions. No mismatch in domains or objects.
- The Lean statement does not separately assert “hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ,” but the theorem established is exactly the angle property that characterizes rotation; moreover rho was defined as the rotation matrix.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  • For an arbitrary complex number z, the statement asserts: |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
  • `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus |·|.
  • `Complex.cos z` is the complex cosine of z.
  • `(z.re : Complex)` coerces the real part Re z into a complex number (with zero imaginary part).
  • `Complex.cos (z.re : Complex)` is the complex cosine evaluated at a real input; this equals the usual real cosine embedded into ℂ, so its modulus equals the real absolute value of cos(Re z).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The code universally quantifies over z ∈ ℂ and states exactly the inequality |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)| using complex modulus on both sides. Since cos(Re z) is real, using Complex.abs on the right is equivalent to the real absolute value. This matches the natural language statement precisely.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement exists (the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing).
- Inequality direction matches.
- The interpretation of |cos(Re z)| aligns with the Lean expression `Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : Complex))`.
- No discrepancies found.

  Means: Let U be an open subset of ℂ, and f : ℂ → ℂ be complex-differentiable on U. Suppose the complex derivative deriv f z is nonzero for every z ∈ U. Then for every z ∈ U, there exists an open set V (open in ℂ) with z ∈ V and V ⊆ U such that f is injective on V. This is precisely the local injectivity statement on U.

- Notes on terms:
  • `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` is the standard Mathlib formulation of “f is holomorphic on U”.
  • `deriv f z` here is the complex derivative (since the domain equals the scalar field ℂ), matching f′(z) in the statement.
  • The conclusion uses `Set.InjOn f V`, i.e., f is injective on V, and V is open and contained in U, which yields that f is locally injective at each z ∈ U in the subspace topology. 

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement assumes f : U → ℂ is holomorphic; the Lean version takes f : ℂ → ℂ holomorphic on U. This is a standard and faithful reformulation, since only the behavior on U matters.
- The derivative condition `f'(z) ≠ 0` for all z ∈ U matches `hf' : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`.
- The conclusion “f is locally injective on U” is expressed as “for each z ∈ U there exists an open V with z ∈ V ⊆ U and f is injective on V,” which is exactly the usual meaning (indeed slightly stronger since V is open in ℂ, hence open in the subspace U).

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code states the intended theorem directly (proof omitted is acceptable per the instructions).

There is also no formal mention of Taylor series, radius of convergence, distance to nearest singularity, or equality of the sum to f.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: If f is holomorphic on a domain U ⊂ ℂ, then f is analytic. More precisely, for each z0 ∈ U, f has a Taylor series that converges on the disk |z−z0| < R where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the series sums to f.
- The Lean code only states “holomorphic_on f U → analytic_at f z0” with vacuous placeholders. It does not express that U is a domain (open and connected), does not mention the radius of convergence, does not relate that radius to the distance to the nearest singularity, and does not assert the series sums to f (beyond an informal comment in the docstring). The formal content is therefore far weaker and, due to placeholders, entirely meaningless.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. Key differences:
  - Uses vacuous placeholders for holomorphic_on and analytic_at instead of Mathlib’s established notions (e.g., Complex.DifferentiableOn, AnalyticAt ℂ, AnalyticOn, HolomorphicOn).
  - Omits the requirement that U is a domain (open and connected).
  - Omits the critical radius statement: R equals the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞).
  - Omits the explicit statement that the Taylor series sums to f on the disk (not captured in the formal statement; only hinted by a comment).
  - The theorem is only pointwise at a chosen z0 with hz0 : z0 ∈ U; while that part by itself could be acceptable for “holomorphic implies analytic,” it still lacks the radius and singularity relation.

Given these issues, the translation fails both due to vacuous auxiliary definitions and because, even if those were replaced by proper Mathlib notions, the theorem statement would still miss the core “radius equals distance to nearest singularity” content.

- Hypothesis `h_maps : ∀ z, z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1 → Complex.abs (f z) < 1` says that for every z in the open unit disk, |f z| < 1, i.e., f maps the unit disk into itself.
- Hypothesis `h0 : f 0 = 0` says f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1` states |f′(0)| ≤ 1, where `deriv f 0` is the complex derivative of f at 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The NL statement: “Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f′(0)| ≤ 1.”
- Holomorphic on 𝔻 matches `AnalyticOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1)`.
- Mapping 𝔻 to itself matches `∀ z ∈ 𝔻, |f z| < 1`.
- f(0) = 0 matches `h0 : f 0 = 0`.
- Conclusion |f′(0)| ≤ 1 matches `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1`.
The only presentational difference is that Lean takes f as a function ℂ → ℂ and asserts analyticity only on the disk, whereas the NL statement has f with domain 𝔻. This is standard in Mathlib: one works with a global function analytic on the relevant open set. This does not strengthen the hypothesis in a way that changes the mathematical meaning; it faithfully encodes the same assumption about f on 𝔻.

3) Final check:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- The concepts used (AnalyticOn, Metric.ball, Complex.abs, deriv) are standard Mathlib.
- The theorem statement matches the NL statement in mathematical content.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Let U be open and connected, f is analytic on U, z0 ∈ U with f(z0)=c and deriv f z0 = 0. Then either f = c on U, or there exist a natural number m and an open set V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, and (no substantive condition: just True).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement
Original statement: Let U ⊂ ℂ be a domain (open, connected) and f: U → ℂ holomorphic and not constant. If f(z0)=c and f'(z0)=0, then either f ≡ c on U, or else if z0 is a zero of f−c of order m, there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicities).

Comparisons:
- Domain: Code uses IsOpen U and IsConnected U: matches.
- Holomorphic: Code uses AnalyticOn ℂ f U: good.
- Non-constant: Original assumes f is not constant; code has no such assumption. The code still includes the disjunction with the constant case; this is a mismatch in hypotheses.
- Conditions at z0: f(z0)=c and f'(z0)=0: present (hval, hderiv). Note: code uses deriv f z0 for f : ℂ → ℂ, not f : U → ℂ. While acceptable structurally, it assumes f is defined on all ℂ, not just U.
- Conclusion: Original has a precise alternative: if z0 is a zero of f−c of order m, then there exists a neighborhood V where the fiber f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity). The code’s second disjunct is completely vacuous: it merely claims ∃ m, ∃ V open with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, and then appends True, with no relation to zeros, order, or the cardinality of the local fiber. It does not quantify that z0 is a zero of order m, nor does it assert that the local preimage has exactly m points counted with multiplicities.
- The code does not mention multiplicities, zeros, order, or the structure of f^{-1} {c} near z0 at all.

Step 3: Final check: Same or different?
They are different. The Lean theorem’s second alternative is vacuous and does not even attempt to encode the local counting statement or the order of the zero. It also omits the ""nonconstant"" assumption. Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Additional red flags:
- The use of True in the conclusion is a clear placeholder, making the existential claim trivial and unrelated to the intended property.
- f is typed as ℂ → ℂ instead of U → ℂ, which is acceptable if one phrases analyticity on U, but still departs from the original function type.

Grade rationale:
Severely unfaithful: critical parts of the statement are missing or replaced by a vacuous True. No auxiliary defs are introduced, but the theorem statement itself is vacuous in the crucial part. Hence a very low grade.

- M.mulVec v1 = (ofReal a + I * ofReal b) • v1 ∧ M.mulVec v2 = (ofReal a - I * ofReal b) • v2
  Asserts two eigenpair equalities: v1 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue a + i b, and v2 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue a − i b (all coerced into ℂ via ofReal).

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful to the original statement?
- The natural statement: For the 2×2 matrix representing a + i b, i.e., [[a, −b], [b, a]], the eigenvalues are a ± i b with corresponding eigenvectors [1; ∓ i].
- The code exactly constructs M = [[a, −b], [b, a]] (as complex entries via ofReal) and the vectors [1; −i] and [1; i], and asserts the two eigenpair equalities. This directly encodes the claim.
- The base field: The statement implicitly treats M as a real matrix; the code treats M as a complex matrix whose entries are real via ofReal. This does not change the mathematical content of the eigenpair identities; it is a standard, faithful formalization for discussing complex eigenvalues/vectors.
- The code claims both eigenpairs simultaneously (using ∧), matching the ""has two eigenvalues ... with corresponding eigenvectors"" phrasing. It does not claim exclusivity, which the original statement also does not require.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the lets for M, v1, v2 are concrete.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions (Matrix, Complex, mulVec, smul) appropriately.
- Indices handled with Fin 2; equality to 0 is well-typed (0 coerces to Fin 2), so the shape is precise.
- The only minor type deviation (matrix over ℂ instead of ℝ) is benign and preserves meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  This lemma states: For every complex number z, the complex modulus of 1 / sin(z) is at least the complex modulus of 1 / sin(z.re), where z.re is treated as a real coerced to ℂ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The mathematical content matches the intended inequality: it encodes |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)| with csc interpreted as 1/sin, and uses Complex.abs for the modulus. Interpreting csc(Re z) as a complex number obtained by coercing the real input is consistent, since | · | on ℝ equals Complex.abs after coercion.
- Potential mismatch: domain/partiality. In standard mathematics, csc is only defined where sin ≠ 0 (meromorphic function), so the natural-language statement is implicitly about z for which both csc z and csc(Re z) are defined. In Lean, 1 / Complex.sin z is total, with 1 / 0 = 0 by convention. Thus the Lean statement asserts an inequality for all z, including points where sin z = 0 or sin (Re z) = 0, at which the classical csc is undefined. This is a subtle but real mismatch in domain assumptions.
- Aside from this domain issue, the formulation is otherwise faithful: correct quantification (for all z ∈ ℂ), correct functions (Complex.sin, Complex.abs), and the intended inequality direction.

3) Final comparison:
- Same core mathematical inequality, but the Lean version totalizes csc via 1/sin over all z, whereas the natural-language statement (by usual conventions) concerns the domain where sin ≠ 0. Given the strict auditing criteria, this domain mismatch means the translation is not fully faithful.

Grade rationale: No vacuous definitions, correct constructs, and only a domain subtlety; hence high but not perfect.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

  Let U be an open subset of ℂ, let f : ℂ → ℂ be a function that is complex-differentiable on U, and assume f is injective on all of ℂ. Then for every z ∈ U, the complex derivative `deriv f z` is nonzero.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL: U ⊆ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective (i.e., injective as a function on U). Conclusion: f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean: U open, f : ℂ → ℂ is differentiable on U, and f is injective on all of ℂ. Conclusion: deriv f z ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.

3) Differences:
- Domain: NL has f : U → ℂ. Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability restricted to U. This is acceptable as a common formalization, provided the properties (like injectivity) are restricted to U as well.
- Injectivity: NL requires injectivity on U (as a map U → ℂ). In Lean, the hypothesis is `Function.Injective f`, i.e., injective on all of ℂ, which is strictly stronger than needed. The faithful formalization should be `Set.InjOn f U` or, alternatively, declare `f : U → ℂ` with `Function.Injective f`.
- Holomorphic: `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` correctly captures holomorphic on U.
- Conclusion: Matches: nonvanishing derivative at every point of U.

Thus, the Lean theorem strengthens the hypothesis (global injectivity) compared to the original (injective only on U). That mismatch means the translation is not faithful, even though it is very close and could be fixed by replacing `Function.Injective f` with `Set.InjOn f U` or by redefining the domain of f as `U → ℂ`.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; the only issue is the overly strong injectivity hypothesis.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- Comment explains the intended formalizations: holomorphic at z0 is `DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0`, and ""conformal at z0"" is expressed as the existence of a (complex-)Frechet derivative at z0 that is a conformal linear map.
- The theorem `holomorphic_conformal_iff_deriv_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ} (h : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0)` states: assuming f is complex-differentiable at z0, the following are equivalent: (i) there exists a complex-linear continuous linear map f' such that `HasFDerivAt f f' z0` and `IsConformalMap f'`, i.e., f is conformal at z0; (ii) `deriv f z0 ≠ 0`.

This matches the standard definition: conformal at a point means the (Fréchet) derivative exists and is a conformal linear map. For functions ℂ → ℂ, this is equivalent to the complex derivative being nonzero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.""
- Lean: Assumes only `DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0` (a local holomorphicity assumption at z0) and proves: f is conformal at z0 iff `deriv f z0 ≠ 0`.
- The left-hand side explicitly encodes conformality at z0 via the derivative being a conformal linear map; the right-hand side uses `deriv f z0 ≠ 0`. This is the expected equivalence.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only difference is the strength of the hypothesis: the natural language says ""f is holomorphic"" (typically meaning on a neighborhood or globally), while the Lean statement assumes only that f is differentiable at the point z0. This is a mild strengthening (the Lean statement needs less), but it does not change the mathematical content of the asserted equivalence at the given point. There are no vacuous placeholders or auxiliary fake definitions; the concepts used (`DifferentiableAt`, `HasFDerivAt`, `IsConformalMap`, `deriv`) are standard Mathlib notions.
- Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to a harmless strengthening of the hypothesis from global to pointwise holomorphicity.

- `theorem abs_sin_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the absolute value of sin z is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). That is, |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the absolute value of cos z is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). That is, |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove that |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems exactly assert these two inequalities for all z : Complex, using Complex.abs for |·| and Real.exp for e^{·}. The factor (1/2) is represented as (1/2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z), which is mathematically identical to (1/2) e^{|z|}. There are no extra hypotheses or missing conditions.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary definitions are introduced, and the theorems directly state the two desired inequalities. The use of `sorry` in the proofs is acceptable under the instruction that no proofs are required; the statements themselves match exactly.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `variable {U : Set ℂ} (ψ : ℂ × ℝ → ℂ)`: We fix an open set U in ℂ (later assumed open) and a function ψ defined on ℂ × ℝ with values in ℂ.
- The theorem `integral_of_holomorphic_is_holomorphic` has hypotheses:
  • `U_open : IsOpen U`: U is open in ℂ.
  • `ψ_cont : ContinuousOn (fun p : ℂ × ℝ => ψ p) (U ×ˢ (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1))`: ψ is continuous on the subset U × [0,1] (Icc denotes the closed interval [0,1]).
  • `holo_fiber : ∀ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ψ (z, t)) U`: For each fixed t ∈ [0,1], the function z ↦ ψ(z, t) is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ∫ t in Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ψ (z, t) ∂volume) U`: The function h(z) := ∫_{t∈[0,1]} ψ(z, t) d(volume) (Lebesgue integral over [0,1]) is complex differentiable on U, i.e., holomorphic on U.

2) Faithfulness assessment to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: U ⊆ ℂ open; ψ: U × [0,1] → ℂ continuous; for each t, z ↦ ψ(z,t) is holomorphic on U; then h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z,t) dt is holomorphic on U.
- The Lean hypotheses match exactly: openness of U, continuity of ψ on U × [0,1], and holomorphy in z for each t on U. The conclusion matches: the integral in t yields a holomorphic function on U.
- Minor formal differences are benign and standard in Mathlib: using DifferentiableOn ℂ to express holomorphic on an open set; using the Lebesgue integral over Icc [0,1] with volume measure instead of a Riemann integral—these agree for continuous integrands. Also ψ is given as a function on ℂ × ℝ but only required to satisfy the properties on U × [0,1]; this is a harmless generalization, since any ψ: U × [0,1] can be extended arbitrarily to ℂ × ℝ without affecting the statement restricted to U.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of ψ: Lean uses ψ: ℂ × ℝ → ℂ with conditions only on U × [0,1]; NL has ψ defined only on U × [0,1]. This is equivalent for the purpose of the theorem and does not strengthen the assumptions on U × [0,1].
- Integral notion: Lean uses Lebesgue integral on [0,1]; NL uses the usual integral dt. With continuity, these coincide.
- Conclusion is precisely “h is holomorphic on U.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; everything is standard Mathlib terminology.

Therefore, the code statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib; open Complex: Bring in Mathlib and open the Complex namespace (notation like Complex.abs).
- lemma exists_point_with_smaller_value_polynomial (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) (p : Polynomial ℂ)
  (hp_nonconst : ¬ ∃ (c : ℂ), p = Polynomial.C c) (z0 : ℂ)

  ∃ w : ℂ, Complex.abs (w - z0) < ε ∧ Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval w p) < Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval z0 p) := by sorry
  Translation: For any real ε > 0, any complex polynomial p that is nonconstant (i.e., not equal to a constant polynomial C c), any z0 ∈ ℂ with p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w ∈ ℂ such that |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Original statement: Let ε > 0, let p be a nonconstant complex polynomial, or more generally a nonconstant power series converging in the open disk { z : |z − z0| < ε }, and suppose p(z0) ≠ 0. Then there exists w in that disk with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- The Lean lemma exactly matches the polynomial case: ε > 0, p a nonconstant complex polynomial, z0 with p(z0) ≠ 0, and there exists w with |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- Agreement: The lemma captures the polynomial case accurately, including the requirement that w lie in the ε-disk centered at z0, and the inequality |p(w)| < |p(z0)|, under the hypothesis p(z0) ≠ 0.
- Difference: The original statement explicitly includes a more general case: p can be a nonconstant power series converging in the disk { |z − z0| < ε }. The Lean code does not handle power series at all; it only addresses polynomials. Thus, it proves a strictly weaker statement (a special case) than the full natural language statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions, and the nonconstancy condition ¬ ∃ c, p = C c is correct for polynomials.

Conclusion: The translation is not fully faithful to the original statement because it omits the general power series case, even though it is correct for the polynomial special case.

Since cos(Re z) is real, taking Complex.abs is the same as taking the usual absolute value.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
- The Lean statement quantifies over all z : ℂ and asserts Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : ℂ)). This matches the intended inequality. Using Complex.abs on the right is equivalent to real absolute value because cos(Re z) is real (imaginary part zero when input is real), so this is a faithful representation.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification matches (for any z).
- Functions used (cos, Re, absolute value) match appropriate complex versions.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of the complex sine of z is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of the complex sine of the complex embedding of the real part of z.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|.
- In Lean, `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus, `Complex.sin` is the complex sine, and `(z.re : ℂ)` embeds the real part as a complex number. For real arguments, `Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ)` equals the complex embedding of `Real.sin z.re`, and `Complex.abs` on a real equals the usual real absolute value. Thus the Lean statement matches the intended inequality precisely.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, assuming |z| < 1, we have |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * |z| / (1 - |z|). Here `Complex.abs` is the modulus |·| and `Complex.arctan` is the complex arctangent. The right-hand side is exactly (π/4)|z|/(1−|z|).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypothesis `h : Complex.abs z < 1` corresponds exactly to “whenever |z| < 1”.
- The conclusion matches the inequality with the same functions: absolute value of complex arctan and modulus of z. The constants and operations are identical: `Real.pi / 4` corresponds to π/4; division by `(1 - Complex.abs z)` is exactly the denominator.

  Conclusion: `∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) = Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`.
  This is the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ (i.e., n = 0,1,2,...) of |z|^(n+1), which is exactly the same as the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n by an index shift. The right-hand side is |z|/(1 - |z|).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asks to show, for z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, that ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 - |z|).
- The Lean statement has the same hypothesis and asserts `∑' n, |z|^(n+1) = |z|/(1 - |z|)`, which is exactly the same series (shifted index) and the same formula.

Checks for issues:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement.

The original states: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean code provides exactly these two inequalities as separate theorems, universally quantified over z : ℂ.

- Left-hand side: `Complex.abs ( Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => (z ^ k) / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ) - Complex.exp z )`
  This is the absolute value of the finite sum over k = 0,...,n of the expression `(z^k)/k! - e^z`. In other words, it is |∑_{k=0}^n [(z^k)/k! − e^z]|.
- Right-hand side: `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (Nat.factorial (n + 1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`
  This is (|z|)^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! times e^{|z|}. The factorials are appropriately cast to ℂ on the LHS term and to ℝ on the RHS, which is fine since the absolute value is real.
- `:= by sorry` indicates no proof is provided; that's acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
Original: For all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ,
  |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
This means we first take the finite sum S_n = ∑ z^k/k!, then form the difference S_n − e^z, and take its absolute value: |(∑ z^k/k!) − e^z|.

Lean code: It instead forms the sum of the differences: ∑ [(z^k)/k! − e^z], then takes absolute value: |∑_{k=0}^n [(z^k)/k! − e^z]|. This equals |(∑ z^k/k!) − (n+1) e^z|, which is different from |(∑ z^k/k!) − e^z|.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The code subtracts e^z inside the summand, leading to an extra factor (n+1) in front of e^z after summation. The intended statement subtracts e^z once after summing. The RHS bound matches the intended form, but the LHS is mis-parenthesized in the code. All other aspects (domains, ranges, absolute values, factorial casts, exponential of |z|) are consistent.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful due to the placement of − e^z inside the sum rather than outside it.

- NL: For all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
- Lean: Exactly the same objects: z ∈ ℂ, n ∈ ℕ; the partial sum of the exponential series; complex absolute value; the exponential of z; and the bound |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! times e^{|z|}. Parenthesization and ordering are equivalent. Quantification is universal via arguments `(z : ℂ) (n : ℕ)`.

  This states: For any complex number z, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|), where |·| is the complex absolute value (a real number) and exp is the real exponential. This matches “|sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} for all z ∈ ℂ.”

- The Lean statements use Complex.abs for the modulus and Real.exp of that modulus, exactly corresponding to e^{|z|} in the natural language.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Bring in mathlib and matrix namespace.
- def M2 := Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ: Define the type of real 2×2 matrices.
- def G : Set M2ˣ := { u | (u : M2) (1 : Fin 2) 0 = 0 }: Define G as the set of invertible 2×2 real matrices (units in the matrix ring) whose (row 1, col 0) entry is 0. Using Fin 2 indices {0,1}, this is the lower-left entry. So G = { [[a,b],[0,c]] ∈ GL(2,ℝ) }.
- def N : Set M2ˣ := { u | (u : M2) 0 0 = 1 ∧ (u : M2) 1 1 = 1 ∧ (u : M2) (1 : Fin 2) 0 = 0 }: Define N as the set of invertible 2×2 real matrices with diagonal entries 1,1 and lower-left entry 0. Thus N = { [[1,b],[0,1]] } (these are automatically invertible).
- theorem G_is_subgroup: States the subgroup axioms for G inside the ambient group M2ˣ: identity ∈ G, closure under multiplication, and closure under inversion.
- theorem N_is_subgroup: Same subgroup axioms for N.
- theorem N_normal : ∀ g ∈ G, ∀ n ∈ N, g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N: States that N is stable under conjugation by elements of G, i.e., normal in G (together with N being a subgroup and N ⊆ G by definition).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- The NL statement defines G as the set of real 2×2 matrices of the form [[a,b],[0,c]] and asks to show it is a subgroup of GL(2). The code defines G as a subset of the unit group M2ˣ (i.e., GL(2,ℝ)) consisting of matrices with lower-left entry 0. This matches the intended set intersected with GL(2), which is the only meaningful way to regard G as a subgroup of GL(2).
- The NL statement defines N = { [[1,b],[0,1]] } and asks to prove N ◁ G, noting one must show N is a subgroup as well as normal. The code defines N exactly as those matrices and provides two theorems: N_is_subgroup (subgroup axioms) and N_normal (conjugation invariance by G). Since N's definition includes the G-defining property ((1,0) entry is 0), N ⊆ G holds definitionally, so together these statements express precisely that N is a normal subgroup of G.
- The ambient group in code is M2ˣ, which is GL(2,ℝ) in mathlib terms. That faithfully models the setting.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Potential ambiguity in NL: ""set of all matrices of the form"" includes singular matrices, but since the target is a subgroup of GL(2), the intended set is the intersection with GL(2). The code correctly formalizes G and N as subsets of the units. This is standard and faithful.
- The code does not construct Subgroup structures but states the subgroup axioms explicitly; this is an acceptable formalization of ""is a subgroup"" and faithful to the mathematical meaning.
- No vacuous placeholders: G and N are genuine predicates; no use of True or dummy definitions.
- Normality is expressed as closure under conjugation by G, which, together with N being a subgroup and N ⊆ G (true by definition), matches N ◁ G.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the NL statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context is permutations on Fin n (0,1,...,n-1), i.e., Perm (Fin n), which is a standard representation of Sym_n.
- Hypotheses: n : ℕ with hn : 2 ≤ n and hnz : NeZero n (this is redundant given 2 ≤ n), and i : ℕ with 1 < i ∧ i < n.
- Define α := Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n 0) (Fin.ofNat n 1). This is the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in 0-based indexing, corresponding to (1 2) in 1-based notation. Good.
- Define β as the permutation induced by k ↦ Fin.ofNat n (k.val + 1), i.e., successor mod n, intended to be the n-cycle (0 1 … n-1). However, the code supplies its bijectivity via a placeholder proof: `by have ... := by sorry; exact this`. This is a vacuous/placeholder proof inside a definition.
- Claim: swap (Fin.ofNat n (i - 1)) (Fin.ofNat n i) = β^(i - 1) * α * β^(n - i + 1). In 0-based indices, swapping (i-1, i) corresponds to (i, i+1) in 1-based notation. The right-hand side is a conjugation of α by β^(i-1) using the fact β^(n - i + 1) is β^(-(i-1)) because β has order n.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: For n ≥ 2, α = (1,2), β = (1,2,...,n) ∈ Sym_n, for any 1 < i < n, (i,i+1) = β^{i-1} α β^{-(i-1)} = β^{i-1} α β^{n-i+1}.
- The Lean code works in Perm (Fin n) instead of Sym_n; that is standard and faithful.
- α is correctly defined as the transposition (1 2) (in 1-based; (0 1) in 0-based). Good.
- β is intended as the n-cycle (successor mod n). Conceptually correct, but its bijectivity (needed to form an Equiv) is provided by a `sorry` inside the definition. This is an auxiliary definition containing a placeholder proof, which is a red flag per the guidelines.
- The statement in Lean asserts only one equality: (i,i+1) = β^(i-1) α β^(n-i+1). It omits the explicit equality with β^{-(i-1)}. While mathematically these two right-hand expressions are equal because β has order n, the code does not state or reference the negative exponent version; thus it captures only part of the NL statement’s explicit formulation. This is a minor discrepancy but still a mismatch if judged strictly.

Other observations:
- Extra hypothesis `hnz : NeZero n` is redundant but harmless.
- The final proof is `by sorry`, which is acceptable for the main theorem per the instructions, but the problematic placeholder is inside the definition of β.

Conclusion: The main mathematical content (the equality with the positive exponent) is captured, but (1) the β definition uses a vacuous placeholder proof (violating the guideline about auxiliary definitions), and (2) the statement omits the explicit equality with the negative exponent appearing in the NL statement. Therefore, the translation is not faithful under the strict auditing criteria.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, giving access to Complex numbers and the exponential function.

- Theorem `mul_add_function_ne_zero {f : Complex → Complex} (h_mul : ∀ z w : Complex, f (z + w) = f z * f w) (h0 : f 0 = 1) : ∀ z : Complex, f z ≠ 0`:
  Natural language: Let f: ℂ → ℂ be a function such that for all z, w ∈ ℂ, f(z + w) = f(z) f(w), and f(0) = 1. Then for all z ∈ ℂ, f(z) ≠ 0.
  This directly matches the “in other words” general formulation in the problem.

- Theorem `exp_ne_zero (z : Complex) : Complex.exp z ≠ 0`:
  Natural language: For every complex number z, e^z ≠ 0. This is the specific conclusion for the complex exponential function.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The original statement has two parts: (1) Use the identities e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 ≠ 0 to show e^z ≠ 0 for all z ∈ ℂ; and (2) equivalently, the general functional equation implication: if f satisfies f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. 
- The Lean code exactly states the general functional-equation lemma (as a theorem with assumptions h_mul and h0) and the specific corollary for the complex exponential. 
- The fact “1 ≠ 0” is not included as an assumption; that’s fine because it is a known property in ℂ and would be used in the proof, not in the statement. The task is about translating the statement, not encoding the proof method.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; both are theorem statements using standard Mathlib objects (Complex, Complex.exp). No red flags.

Final check:
- The two math problems (original and the Lean statements) are the same in meaning. The first theorem exactly captures the “in other words” generalization, and the second theorem states the intended particular conclusion about the exponential function. There are no mismatches in domain/codomain, quantifiers, or conditions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem sec_abs_ge_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (1 / Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (1 / Complex.cos z.re) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of 1 divided by cos(z) is greater than or equal to the modulus of 1 divided by cos of the real part of z. Here `Complex.abs` denotes complex modulus, `Complex.cos` is complex cosine (with `z.re` coerced to a complex number), and the theorem is stated without proof.

2) Faithfulness assessment to the original statement:
- The original statement: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sec z| ≥ |sec (Re z)|.
- The code replaces sec by 1/cos, which is a standard identification and aligns with the statement’s meaning. It uses complex modulus on both sides, which matches the intended absolute value on ℂ; the second term applies complex cosine to the real number Re z (via coercion), which equals the real cosine of Re z, so that also matches the intended |sec(Re z)|.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given. So structurally, it is a direct formalization of the sentence.

3) Key difference (domain/semantics):
- In standard mathematical usage, sec is 1/cos and is undefined at zeros of cos. The natural language statement is typically interpreted as holding where both sides are defined (i.e., cos z ≠ 0 and cos(Re z) ≠ 0). In Lean, `1 / Complex.cos z` is a total function with `1/0 = 0`, so the theorem quantifies over all z, including points where cos z = 0 or cos(Re z) = 0, yielding a different (and potentially false) assertion at those points. This totalization changes the meaning compared with the usual partial-function interpretation of sec.
- Aside from this domain issue, the formula and inequality direction exactly match the natural-language statement.

Conclusion: The code mirrors the textual formula but, being totalized, it asserts the inequality at points where the natural-language expression is typically undefined. Under a strict reading, this is not a fully faithful translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly the two inequalities as a conjunction, with the series written using a shifted index. This is mathematically equivalent.
- The use of `Complex.log` is the principal branch; within the disk |z| < 1, 1 − z avoids the negative real axis, so the principal log is defined and matches the analytic branch satisfying log(1) = 0, consistent with the intended meaning of log in this context.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing of the series matches after the shift (n from 0 with n+1 corresponds to k from 1).
- Both inequalities are present and in the correct order.

Types are consistent (RHS is real), and the factorials are correctly cast. The usage of range (n+1) corresponds to k = 0..n.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib definitions (complex numbers, absolute value, infinite sums, etc.).
- Docstring: States the intended mathematical statement: If |z| < 1 then |log(1 - z)| ≤ ∑' n, |z|^(n+1)/(n+1) ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|).
- theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_19814 (z : ℂ) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry
  Hypotheses: z ∈ ℂ, and |z| < 1.
  Conclusion: A conjunction of two inequalities:
  (1) Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / ((n + 1) : ℝ)
  (2) ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / ((n + 1) : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)
  Here ∑' is the infinite sum over n : ℕ, and the (n+1) indexing means the sum is effectively from 1 to ∞: ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
- The original statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1 - z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z| / (1 - |z|).
- The Lean theorem exactly encodes this:
  • Uses Complex.log for the logarithm; within |z| < 1, 1 - z avoids the branch cut, so this matches the usual principal branch.
  • Uses Complex.abs for absolute value on ℂ and a Real-valued series ∑' (n : ℕ), |z|^(n+1)/(n+1).
  • The conjunction of the two inequalities is equivalent to the chained inequality in the statement.
  • The shift n → n+1 faithfully represents the sum from n=1 to ∞.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The types and operations (absolute value, complex log, infinite sum) are standard Mathlib notions.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Indexing: Lean sums over n ∈ ℕ with term (n+1), equivalent to the original sum from 1. No mismatch.
- Log branch: Lean uses principal Complex.log; for |z| < 1, 1 - z does not lie on the branch cut, so this aligns with the intended meaning of log(1 - z). No practical mismatch.
- Inequality form: Conjunction vs chained inequality: logically equivalent.
- Types and constants: All match the original quantities.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : ‖sinh z‖ ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp ‖z‖ := by sorry` states: For any complex number z, the norm (modulus) of sinh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the norm of z. Here ‖·‖ is the complex norm (absolute value) and `Real.exp ‖z‖` is e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to prove, for any complex z, the two inequalities |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean code states exactly these two inequalities as theorems for an arbitrary `z : ℂ`, using the complex norm `‖·‖` for absolute value and `Real.exp` for the exponential. This matches precisely.

- Quantification: both are universal over z ∈ ℂ.
- Functions and bounds: sinh and cosh, bounded by (1/2) e^{|z|}—identical.

- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_14450 (z : ℂ) : ‖Complex.exp z‖ = Real.exp z.re := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the norm (modulus) of the complex exponential exp(z) equals the real exponential of the real part of z; i.e., |exp(z)| = exp(Re(z)). Here `‖ · ‖` denotes the norm on ℂ (the complex modulus), `Complex.exp z` is the complex exponential e^z, `z.re` is the real part Re(z), and `Real.exp` is the real exponential.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove that |e^z| = e^{Re z}. The Lean statement asserts exactly that: for any complex z, the modulus of e^z equals e to the real part of z. The notation matches Mathlib conventions: the left side uses the complex norm, and the right side uses the real exponential applied to the real part of z. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it's a single theorem statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, including complex numbers and norms.
- Comment: States the intended theorem in words: polarization identity for complex numbers.
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) : ... := by sorry`: Declares a theorem for arbitrary complex numbers z, w.
- Left-hand side: `4 * z * (starRingEnd ℂ w)` means 4 times z times the complex conjugate of w. In Mathlib, `starRingEnd ℂ w` is the star operation on ℂ, i.e., complex conjugation, so this is 4 z conjugate(w).
- Right-hand side:
  - `(Complex.normSq (z + w) : ℂ)` is the square of the complex norm of z + w, coerced from ℝ to ℂ. For complex numbers, `Complex.normSq z = |z|^2`.
  - `- (Complex.normSq (z - w) : ℂ)` subtracts |z - w|^2 (as a complex number via coercion).
  - `+ Complex.I * ( ... )` adds i times the following difference:
    - `(Complex.normSq (z + Complex.I * w) : ℂ)` is |z + i w|^2 (coerced to ℂ),
    - `- (Complex.normSq (z - Complex.I * w) : ℂ)` is minus |z - i w|^2 (coerced to ℂ).
Thus, the statement is exactly: 4 z conj(w) = |z + w|^2 − |z − w|^2 + i (|z + i w|^2 − |z − i w|^2), understood as an equality in ℂ with the real terms embedded into ℂ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language claim is the polarization identity: 4 z\bar{w} = |z+w|^2 − |z−w|^2 + i(|z+iw|^2 − |z−iw|^2).
- The Lean statement matches exactly:
  - z\bar{w} is expressed as z * conj w via `starRingEnd ℂ w`.
  - |·|^2 is expressed via `Complex.normSq`, which equals the squared modulus.
  - The i term is `Complex.I` multiplying the indicated difference.
  - Coercions from ℝ to ℂ on the right-hand side ensure the equality is in ℂ, matching the complex-valued identity.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an unfilled proof (`sorry`), which does not affect the translation.

3) Final check for differences:
- No differences in mathematical content or structure. Notation choices (conjugation via `starRingEnd`, use of `normSq` with coercions) are standard and equivalent. The theorem exactly states the polarization identity as given.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Theorem name: schwarz_lemma.
- Context: f : ℂ → ℂ is a complex-valued function.
- h_diff: f is complex-differentiable on the open unit disk {z : ℂ | |z| < 1} (this encodes holomorphic on the unit disk).
- h_map: For every z with |z| < 1, we have |f z| < 1 (i.e., f maps the open unit disk into itself).
- h0: f 0 = 0.
- Conclusion: ∀ z : ℂ, |f z| ≤ |z| (for all complex numbers z, not just those in the unit disk).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ 𝔻.
- Hypotheses in Lean match: holomorphic on the unit disk (via DifferentiableOn on {z | |z| < 1}) and mapping the disk into itself (|f z| < 1 whenever |z| < 1), and f(0)=0. Representing 𝔻 as a subset of ℂ rather than a dedicated type is acceptable.
- Critical mismatch: The conclusion in Lean asserts |f z| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ ℂ, whereas the statement requires this only for z ∈ 𝔻 (i.e., |z| < 1). This is strictly stronger and not faithful to the original statement.

3) Final check: The two problems are different. The Lean code's conclusion is too strong: it removes the restriction z ∈ 𝔻 and claims the inequality for all z ∈ ℂ. This is not equivalent to the original and is incorrect as a translation. Everything else matches reasonably well, but this key quantifier/domain error makes the translation unfaithful.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex` are setup lines with no mathematical content.
- `/-- For z : ℂ, |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 * exp (|z|) -/` is a docstring describing the theorem.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the absolute value |sinh z| is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). Here Complex.abs denotes the complex modulus |·|, and Real.exp is the real exponential function exp.
- `/-- For z : ℂ, |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 * exp (|z|) -/` similarly describes the second theorem.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the absolute value |cosh z| is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
Lean: Two theorems, each universally quantified over z : ℂ, stating |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|) and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|). This is exactly the same content. The use of Real.exp for e^{·} and Complex.abs for |·| matches standard interpretations.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Quantification: Both theorems are for all z ∈ ℂ, as in the statement.
- Functions: Uses Complex.sinh and Complex.cosh correctly.
- Inequalities and constants: Exactly |·| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; proofs are omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation checking.
Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. Again, proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asks to prove, for z ∈ C, that |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean lemmas state exactly these two inequalities for arbitrary z : Complex, using Complex.abs for |·| and Real.exp for e^{·}. The factor (1/2 : ℝ) matches 1/2. Thus the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification: NL says “Let z ∈ C” and gives two inequalities; Lean states two lemmas universally quantified over z : Complex. Equivalent.
- Functions and norms: `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus |·|; `Real.exp` is the real exponential; applied to `Complex.abs z` gives e^{|z|}. `Complex.sin` and `Complex.cos` match sin and cos on C. No discrepancies.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: uses Mathlib, standard.
- The docstring states the goal: for complex `a, b`, show `|a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 * Re (a * conj b)`, and notes it's given in an equivalent form using real and imaginary parts: `Re(a * conj b) = a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im`.
- `theorem normSq_add_eq (a b : ℂ) : Complex.normSq (a + b) = Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b + 2 * (a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im) := by sorry`
  This asserts that for complex numbers `a, b`, the square of the norm (normSq) of `a + b` equals the sum of the norm squares plus twice `(a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im)`.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement is `|a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar{b})`.
- In Mathlib, `Complex.normSq z` is `z.re^2 + z.im^2` and equals `|z|^2` (the square of the complex absolute value). Thus replacing `|·|^2` with `Complex.normSq` is a standard, faithful equivalence.
- Also, `Re(a * conj b) = a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im` for complex numbers `a, b`. Hence the RHS used in the Lean theorem, `2 * (a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im)`, equals `2 * Re(a * conj b)`.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is exactly the original identity, expressed via normSq and expanded real part.

Auxiliary definitions:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only a single theorem declaration with a placeholder proof. The statement itself uses standard Mathlib notions and is not vacuous.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically the same. The differences (using `normSq` instead of `|·|^2` and expanding `Re(a conj b)`) are known equalities in Mathlib and standard complex analysis, so the translation is faithful.

  Translation: For every complex number z, the complex modulus |cos z| is greater than or equal to the real absolute value |cos(Re z)|.

- The Lean statement universally quantifies over z : ℂ and asserts `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.sin (z.re : Complex))`. This matches exactly, interpreting |·| as complex modulus, and using the embedding of Re z into ℂ so that the right-hand side indeed equals the real absolute value of sin(Re z).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Original statement: U ⊂ ℂ is open; f : U → ℂ is holomorphic; f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U; conclude f is locally injective on U.
- The Lean code models f as a function ℂ → ℂ but only assumes differentiability on U, which is a standard and faithful reformulation of f : U → ℂ being holomorphic.
- The derivative condition `deriv f z ≠ 0` for z ∈ U matches f'(z) ≠ 0.
- The conclusion asserts local injectivity: for each z ∈ U, there exists an open neighborhood V with z ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f is injective on V. Since U is open, asking for V open in ℂ with V ⊆ U is equivalent to a neighborhood open in the subspace topology of U, so this captures “locally injective on U.”

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain: original says f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with properties only on U. These are equivalent for this purpose.
- Holomorphic vs DifferentiableOn ℂ: for ℂ → ℂ functions, “holomorphic on U” is exactly `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` in Mathlib.
- Local injectivity formulation: presented in terms of an open set V ⊆ U on which f is injective; this matches the standard meaning.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a lemma with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- Comment block restates the intended theorem in plain words.
- `theorem complex.log_abs_bound_of_norm_lt_one {z : ℂ} (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, we have |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|). Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus |·|, and `Complex.log` is the (principal) complex logarithm. The conclusion is an inequality in ℝ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Hypothesis matches: z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1 is exactly `z : ℂ` with `Complex.abs z < 1`.
- Conclusion matches: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` is precisely |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Potential branch subtlety: `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch. On the domain |z| < 1, 1 − z lies in the open disk centered at 1 of radius 1, contained in the right half-plane and avoiding the branch cut; thus the principal log agrees with the standard holomorphic branch given by the power series. Hence there is no mismatch with the intended meaning of “log” in the natural statement.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The Lean theorem states exactly the same mathematical claim as the natural language statement, with the same hypotheses and conclusion, in standard Mathlib terms. No discrepancies in quantifiers, domains, or functions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- The theorem statement: `theorem complex_abs_geometric_sum (z : Complex) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : ∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ n = Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` reads as: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite series sum over all natural numbers n (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) of |z|^n equals |z|/(1 - |z|).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: For z with |z| < 1, ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 - |z|).
- The Lean statement sums from n = 0 (since `n : ℕ` and `∑'` over ℕ includes 0), i.e., it states ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 - |z|). This is not the same as the intended sum from n = 1.
- The correct identity for the sum starting at n = 0 is 1/(1 - |z|), not |z|/(1 - |z|). The sum starting at n = 1 is |z|/(1 - |z|).

3) Final check:
- The two statements differ by the starting index of the series. The Lean code claims an identity that is actually false as stated (it asserts the n=0 sum equals |z|/(1 - |z|)). A faithful Lean translation would need either `∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n+1)` or sum over `n : ℕ+` (positive naturals), or adjust the right-hand side to 1/(1 - |z|) if starting at 0.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present, but the theorem statement itself does not match the natural language statement due to the index mismatch.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the starting index discrepancy.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib; no mathematical content.
- Comment: Restates the goal: for z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 · exp |z| and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 · exp |z|.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This declares, for an arbitrary complex number z, the inequality |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|). Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus (a real number), `Complex.sinh` is the complex hyperbolic sine, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential function applied to the real number |z|. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_half_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Similarly, for any complex number z, this states |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|), with `Complex.cosh` the complex hyperbolic cosine.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- Lean: Exactly the two inequalities, using standard Mathlib names and notation: modulus via `Complex.abs`, exponential via `Real.exp`, and factor (1/2) as a real scalar. Each is universally quantified over z : ℂ.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches precisely. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only theorem statements. Using `sorry` for proofs does not affect translation faithfulness per the instructions. Notationally and semantically, the inequalities are identical to the original.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib / open Metric: Setup, no mathematical content.
- Theorem name and docstring: States Schwarz lemma in words consistent with the intended statement.
- Variables: {f : ℂ → ℂ} — f is a complex-valued function on ℂ.
- Hypothesis hf: DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball (0:ℂ) 1): f is complex differentiable at every point of the open unit disk {z : ‖z‖ < 1}. This corresponds to “holomorphic on the unit disk.”
- Hypothesis hmap: ∀ z, ‖z‖ < 1 → ‖f z‖ < 1: f maps the open unit disk into itself.
- Hypothesis h0: f 0 = 0: f vanishes at 0.
- Conclusion: Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1: the modulus of the complex derivative of f at 0 is at most 1.

Step 2: Compare the whole Lean statement to the natural language statement
Natural language: “Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1.” Here 𝔻 is the open unit disk in ℂ.
- Holomorphic on 𝔻: Lean’s DifferentiableOn ℂ f (ball 0 1) matches this exactly.
- f : 𝔻 → 𝔻: Lean encodes this as ∀ z, ‖z‖ < 1 → ‖f z‖ < 1, which is equivalent to the image of the open disk lying in the open disk.
- f(0) = 0: Matches h0.
- |f'(0)| ≤ 1: Lean’s Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1 matches |f'(0)| ≤ 1.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Domain issue: The NL statement has f defined on 𝔻, while Lean takes f : ℂ → ℂ with properties only asserted on the open unit disk. This is a standard and faithful encoding: any function on 𝔻 can be extended arbitrarily outside 𝔻, and DifferentiableOn and the mapping property depend only on values on 𝔻. No extra assumptions outside 𝔻 are imposed.
- All terms used are standard Mathlib concepts (DifferentiableOn, deriv, Metric.ball). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. No auxiliary definitions exist. The theorem statement exactly captures the mathematical meaning of the NL statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context is Mathlib with ℂ viewed as a 2-dimensional real vector space.
- The theorem det_of_real_linear_map_repr takes complex numbers ξ, ζ and a real-linear endomorphism M : ℂ →ₗ[ℝ] ℂ.
- Hypothesis hM: for all z : ℂ, M z = ξ * z + ζ * (z.re - z.im * I). Since z.re - z.im * I is exactly the complex conjugate of z, this says M is given by z ↦ ξ z + ζ conj z.
- Conclusion: LinearMap.det M = (Complex.abs ξ)^2 - (Complex.abs ζ)^2. Here LinearMap.det is the determinant over ℝ (since M is ℝ-linear), and Complex.abs is the complex modulus |·|.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: a 2×2 real matrix M represented by z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z} has determinant |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- In Lean, a 2×2 real matrix corresponds to a real-linear map ℂ → ℂ via the standard identification ℂ ≅ ℝ^2. The determinant of the real-linear map equals the determinant of the corresponding 2×2 real matrix. So representing M by z ↦ ξ z + ζ conj z matches the hypothesis hM exactly.
- The conclusion matches: det M (over ℝ) equals |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The use of z.re - z.im * I to denote conj z is mathematically correct and avoids reliance on a specific name; it does not change the meaning.
- The theorem’s statement uses standard Mathlib notions (ℂ →ₗ[ℝ] ℂ, LinearMap.det, Complex.abs) appropriately.

Final check: The math problems are the same. The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the original claim.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Boilerplate to use Mathlib and set notation.
- The theorem `injective_holomorphic_deriv_ne_zero` takes:
  - `U : Set ℂ`: an open subset of the complex plane.
  - `f : ℂ → ℂ`: a complex-valued function on the whole complex plane.
  - `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`: f is (complex) differentiable at every point of U, i.e., holomorphic on U.
  - `h_inj : ∀ x y, x ∈ U → y ∈ U → f x = f y → x = y`: f is injective when restricted to U.
  - Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`: for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

Notes: Using `f : ℂ → ℂ` together with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` and injectivity restricted to U is a standard way in Lean to model a function defined on U. The derivative used is `deriv f z` (the usual complex derivative), which is appropriate since `hd` ensures differentiability at points of U; on an open set, `derivWithin f U z = deriv f z` holds, so this matches the intended derivative of a function defined on U.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL: ""If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.""
- Lean: Assumes U open; f is complex differentiable on U; f is injective on U; concludes that for every z in U, the complex derivative is nonzero. This is exactly the same mathematical content. Modeling f as a global function with hypotheses only on U is equivalent to having f with domain U.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain modeling: NL uses f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with hypotheses restricted to U. These are equivalent formulations for the statement at hand.
- Notation for holomorphy: Lean uses `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, which is the standard Mathlib expression for being holomorphic on an open set.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions since we assess translation, not proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- There are no auxiliary definitions, no placeholders for concepts, and the theorems are precisely the stated inequalities. The presence of `sorry` is only in the proofs, which is acceptable per the instruction that no proofs are required; it does not alter the statement.

3) Final check: equivalence of problems
- The two mathematical statements match exactly, both in quantification (for all z ∈ ℂ) and in the inequalities including the factor 1/2 and the exponential of |z|. No discrepancies or extra assumptions. Hence, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : ‖Complex.sinh z‖ ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`: For any complex number z, the complex norm of sinh z is at most (1/2) times the real exponential of the complex absolute value of z; i.e., |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Notes on notation: In Lean, `‖w‖` is the norm on ℂ, which equals the usual complex absolute value; `Complex.abs z` is the same quantity as `‖z‖`, viewed as a real number; `Real.exp` is the real exponential function. Thus the statements match the standard mathematical notation |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ, prove that |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean code states exactly these two inequalities, each universally quantified over z : ℂ. There are no extra hypotheses or altered quantities.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The use of `sorry` only omits the proof and does not affect the statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The inequalities, constants, and domains match exactly: complex absolute values/norms on the left; (1/2) times exp of |z| (real) on the right; for all z ∈ ℂ; both sinh and cosh cases are covered.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and the module comment are boilerplate and context.
- `open Complex` brings Complex-specific names into scope.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of sinh z is less than or equal to (1/2) times the real exponential of the modulus of z. In mathematical notation: ∀ z ∈ ℂ, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of cosh z is less than or equal to (1/2) times the real exponential of the modulus of z. In mathematical notation: ∀ z ∈ ℂ, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asks to prove two inequalities: |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} for z ∈ ℂ. The Lean statements exactly assert these inequalities for all complex z, using Complex.abs for modulus and Real.exp for the exponential.
- There are no extra hypotheses or altered constants; the formulations match precisely.

3) Final check:
- The problems are the same. The code does not introduce any auxiliary or vacuous definitions; it simply states the two desired inequalities as theorems. The use of `by sorry` is acceptable here since we are only auditing the statement translation, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

They are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced, and the quantification and inequality match exactly. The use of Mathlib terms is appropriate and standard.

- Comment explains the goal.
- `theorem complex.abs_cos_le_cosh_im (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ Real.cosh (Complex.im z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus (absolute value) of the complex cosine of z is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic cosine of the imaginary part of z. Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus, `Complex.cos` is the complex cosine, and `Complex.im z` is the real-valued imaginary part of z; `Real.cosh` is hyperbolic cosine on reals.

2) Faithfulness check:
The natural language statement is: If z ∈ ℂ, then |cos z| ≤ cosh(Im z). The Lean statement is exactly that: universal quantification over z : ℂ, and the inequality `|cos z| ≤ cosh(Im z)` with the correct Mathlib constants and functions. The types align: `Complex.im z : ℝ` so `Real.cosh (Complex.im z)` is well-typed. The absolute value is the complex modulus, as intended.

3) Final check:
- Same domain: complex analysis/inequality.
- Same objects: z ∈ ℂ, cos z as complex cosine, modulus |·|, Im z, cosh applied to a real.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard complex number and absolute value definitions.
- The theorem statement: `theorem abs_add_eq_abs_sub_iff_mul_conj_pure_imag {z w : ℂ} (h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w) : Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w) ↔ (z * Star.star w).re = 0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For complex numbers z and w, assuming |z| = |w|, we have |z + w| = |z − w| if and only if the real part of z * conj(w) is 0. Here `Star.star w` is complex conjugation of w, and `(⋯).re = 0` expresses “purely imaginary”.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` loads mathlib.
- `lemma abs_csc_ge_abs_csc_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`
  This asserts: For every complex number z, the complex modulus of 1 divided by the complex sine of z is greater than or equal to the modulus of 1 divided by the complex sine of the real part of z (with the real part coerced to a complex number). In symbols: ∀ z ∈ ℂ, |1/sin z| ≥ |1/sin(Re z)|, where sin and abs are the complex versions.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The NL statement is: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|. Interpreting csc as 1/sin, and taking absolute values in ℂ, the Lean statement mirrors the same inequality and uses the same interpretation (casting Re z to ℂ and using Complex.abs). On that front, the shapes match.
- However, there is a crucial semantic issue: in standard mathematics, csc has poles where sin = 0 and is undefined there. The NL statement implicitly refers to csc as a meromorphic function, so the expression |csc z| is not defined at zeros of sin. In Lean, 1 / Complex.sin z is total because inv 0 = 0 in fields, so at zeros of sin the expression is defined to be 0. Thus the Lean lemma changes the meaning at the poles (it treats |csc| as 0 instead of undefined/infinite), and the quantified statement is over all z with no domain restriction. This is a substantive mismatch in meaning.
- Minor: Using Complex.sin on (z.re : ℂ) is fine (it coincides with the real sine under coercion), and expressing csc as 1/sin is acceptable.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Same inequality direction, same objects (up to expressing csc as 1/sin), same quantification over z.
- Key difference: domain/definedness at zeros of sin. The natural statement refers to csc, which is undefined at poles; the Lean statement uses a total function 1/sin with 1/0 = 0, thereby altering the statement's semantics at precisely those points. No domain restriction (e.g., sin z ≠ 0 and sin (Re z) ≠ 0) is included. This makes the translation not faithful.
- Additionally, independent of translation, the mathematical inequality is actually reversed (|sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)| implies |csc z| ≤ |csc(Re z)| when both are defined), but correctness is not our criterion; still, it underscores the need for careful semantics.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the treatment at poles and lack of domain conditions, despite syntactic similarity.

- The theorem `complex.log_one_sub_series (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' (n : ℕ), z^(n+1) / (n+1)` states: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the principal complex logarithm of (1 - z) equals the negative of the infinite series over natural numbers n of z^(n+1)/(n+1). The sum `∑' (n : ℕ)` is the infinite sum (tsum) over n = 0,1,2,...

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: For z in ℂ with |z| < 1, log(1 - z) = -∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n. The Lean statement uses `∑' (n : ℕ), z^(n+1)/(n+1)`, which is exactly the same series with the index shifted (n := k-1). Thus `∑_{k=1}^∞ z^k/k = ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^(n+1)/(n+1)`. The minus sign matches.
- The absolute value condition `Complex.abs z < 1` matches |z| < 1.
- `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm. On the disk |z| < 1, 1 - z avoids the branch cut and 0, so this matches the standard complex analysis statement.
- No extraneous hypotheses or conclusions are added.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same statement, up to a harmless reindexing of the series. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Complex.log, tsum). Therefore the translation is faithful.

- `theorem sum_abs_pow_div_le (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : ∑' n : ℕ, f z n ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z) := by sorry`: States that for any complex z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of f z n (which equals 0 at n=0 and |z|^n/n for n≥1) is at most |z|/(1 - |z|). Since the n=0 term is 0, this is exactly the inequality for the series from n=1 to ∞.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|).
- The Lean theorem matches this: it sums the sequence defined as 0 at n=0 and |z|^n/n for n≥1 over all n ∈ ℕ, which is equivalent to the sum from n=1 to ∞. The hypothesis |z| < 1 and the conclusion |z|/(1 - |z|) match exactly. The series is in ℝ, consistent with absolute values yielding nonnegative real terms.
- The helper definition f is legitimate and faithfully encodes the intended summand while handling n=0. No vacuous placeholders are used. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions since we're checking translation of statements.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: NL starts at n=1; Lean uses a sum over ℕ with the 0th term set to 0—equivalent.
- Types/values: NL uses absolute value |z| and real inequality; Lean uses Complex.abs z and sums in ℝ—equivalent.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Using Mathlib and opening complex namespace.

- First theorem:
  `/-- For |z| < 1 the principal branch of the complex logarithm satisfies the power series bound.
      |log (1 - z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n. -/`
  `theorem complex_log_abs_le_tsum {z : ℂ} (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) :
    Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the absolute value of the principal complex logarithm log(1 − z) is bounded above by the infinite series sum over n of |z|^n / n. Here the sum is written as a Tsum over n : ℕ. In Lean, this starts at n = 0, but the n = 0 term equals (|z|^0)/(0) = 1/0 = 0 by the convention inv 0 = 0, so the series is effectively ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n as in the comment and the natural language statement.

- Second theorem:
  `/-- The numerical bound ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z| / (1 - |z|) for |z| < 1. -/`
  `theorem tsum_abs_pow_div_le_geom {z : ℂ} (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) :
    (∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For |z| < 1, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n is bounded above by |z|/(1 − |z|). Again, the Lean series starts at n = 0 but the 0th term is 0, so it equals the sum from n = 1.

No auxiliary placeholder definitions are introduced; both are theorems with omitted proofs, which is acceptable per the task.

Step 2: Compare to the original natural language statement
Original statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show that |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).

The code states exactly the two inequalities comprising that chain:
- First theorem: |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n (with the Lean series written from n = 0 but equal to the n ≥ 1 sum due to the 0-term being 0).
- Second theorem: ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).

It also makes clear the log is the principal branch (Complex.log), which is the standard convention in such a context and compatible with |z| < 1.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Indexing: The Lean code uses `∑' n : ℕ` (starting at 0), but the n = 0 term is 0, so it is exactly the same as the sum from n = 1 in the NL statement. This is a logically equivalent formulation.
- Splitting into two theorems rather than one chained inequality: logically equivalent and faithful.
- Branch of logarithm: The code uses the principal branch; the NL statement did not specify, but this is standard and appropriate; for |z| < 1, 1 − z ≠ 0, so Complex.log is well-defined.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions, no mismatches in quantifiers or hypotheses. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem arg_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.arg (Complex.exp z) = z.im := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the principal argument (Complex.arg) of the complex exponential e^z equals the imaginary part of z. That is, Arg(e^z) = Im(z).
- `theorem abs_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus (absolute value) of e^z equals e raised to the real part of z. That is, |e^z| = e^{Re(z)}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For z ∈ C, show that Arg(e^z) = Im z and |e^z| = e^{Re z}.
- Lean uses `Complex.arg` for principal argument (uppercase Arg in common notation), `Complex.exp` for e^z, `Complex.abs` for the complex modulus, and `Real.exp z.re` for e^{Re z}. The two Lean theorems exactly restate the two desired equalities with standard mathlib notions and no extraneous hypotheses.

3) Final check for differences:
- Arg: The natural language uses uppercase Arg, which conventionally denotes the principal argument. Mathlib’s `Complex.arg` is indeed the principal argument. No mismatch.
- Domain issues: e^z ≠ 0, so Arg is well-defined; Mathlib’s `Complex.arg` is defined for all complex numbers anyway, so no extra constraint is needed. No discrepancy introduced.
- Absolute value and exponential are represented correctly (`Complex.abs`, `Real.exp`, `z.re`, `z.im`).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the statements are direct translations. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per instructions, since we are auditing translation, not proofs.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem statement declares: for a function f : ℂ → ℂ and a point z₀ : ℂ, ConformalAt f z₀ is equivalent to (DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀ ∧ deriv f z₀ ≠ 0). In words: a map f is conformal at z₀ if and only if f is complex-differentiable at z₀ and its complex derivative at z₀ is nonzero.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement assumes f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic (typically meaning complex-differentiable on an open set, often the whole ℂ in this phrasing) and asks to show: f is conformal at z₀ if and only if f'(z₀) ≠ 0.
- Under the “holomorphic” assumption, DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀ automatically holds, so the desired equivalence reduces to ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ deriv f z₀ ≠ 0.
- The Lean theorem, however, does not include the “holomorphic” hypothesis. Instead, it builds DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀ into the right-hand side as an extra conjunct. Thus, as stated, it claims the equivalence for arbitrary f, not merely holomorphic f.

3) Final comparison: same or different?
- Different. The original statement is conditional on f being holomorphic; within that context, the equivalence is ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ f'(z₀) ≠ 0. The Lean code states an unconditional equivalence: ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ (DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀ ∧ f'(z₀) ≠ 0). This is a strictly stronger and different statement.
- Moreover, there is a subtle definitional nuance in Mathlib: ConformalAt for ℂ → ℂ is the real-analytic notion of conformality (angle preservation), which includes anti-holomorphic maps (like complex conjugation) as conformal. The Lean statement would then be false in general if intended unconditionally, since conj is conformal but not complex-differentiable; however, the audit’s task is faithfulness, and the lack of the holomorphic assumption already breaks faithfulness.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present, so the only issue is the missing hypothesis and the strengthened equivalence form.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation of the given natural language statement due to the missing holomorphic assumption and the added differentiability conjunct on the right. The mismatch is small but essential.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Load the Mathlib library.
- `variable (z : ℂ)`: Fix an arbitrary complex number z.
- `theorem exp_conj_eq : Complex.exp ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.exp z) := by sorry`
  This asserts: exp(conj z) = conj(exp z). Here `(starRingEnd ℂ)` is the complex conjugation as a ring endomorphism on ℂ, so `(starRingEnd ℂ) z` means the complex conjugate of z, and `(starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.exp z)` means the complex conjugate of e^z.
- `theorem sin_conj_eq : Complex.sin ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.sin z) := by sorry`
  This asserts: sin(conj z) = conj(sin z).
- `theorem cos_conj_eq : Complex.cos ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.cos z) := by sorry`
  This asserts: cos(conj z) = conj(cos z).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: For any z ∈ ℂ, show e^{\overline{z}} = \overline{e^z}, sin(\overline{z}) = \overline{\sin z}, and cos(\overline{z}) = \overline{\cos z}. The Lean code states exactly these three identities, using `(starRingEnd ℂ)` to denote complex conjugation. The `variable (z : ℂ)` ensures these are statements for an arbitrary complex number z (i.e., universally quantified). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the use of `sorry` is acceptable since we're only checking statement translation.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Notation: The code uses `(starRingEnd ℂ)` instead of an overline; this is standard and equivalent to complex conjugation in Mathlib.
- Quantification: Declared via `variable (z : ℂ)`, which makes each theorem universally quantified in z.
- Functions: Uses `Complex.exp`, `Complex.sin`, and `Complex.cos`, matching e^z, sin z, cos z on ℂ.
There are no substantive differences.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language statement.

Natural language: Let U be an open subset of ℂ, f: ℂ → ℂ is complex differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U), and z0 ∈ U. Suppose there exists r > 0 such that for all z in U ∩ ball(z0, r), |f z| ≤ |f z0|. Then there exists r' > 0 such that for all z in U ∩ ball(z0, r'), f z = f z0; i.e., f is constant in a neighborhood of z0 within U.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement
- Original: U ⊆ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic. If |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U, then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
- Lean uses `f : ℂ → ℂ` with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, which is the standard Mathlib way to say f is holomorphic on U (equivalent to having a function U → ℂ holomorphic). The local maximum hypothesis is encoded as: ∃ r > 0, ∀ z ∈ U ∩ ball z0 r, |f z| ≤ |f z0|, which is exactly “|f| attains a local maximum at z0” in the subspace topology on U. The conclusion states existence of r > 0 such that f is constant on U ∩ ball z0 r, which is precisely “f is constant in a neighborhood of z0” in U.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Domain handling: Using f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U is a faithful and standard encoding of f : U → ℂ holomorphic.
- Local maximum: The set U ∩ ball z0 r matches the notion of a neighborhood in U. Attainment at z0 is implicit since z0 ∈ U and z0 ∈ ball z0 r for r > 0.
- Conclusion: Constancy on U ∩ ball z0 r is exactly “constant in a neighborhood of z0”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib; fine.
- Comment: States it's a bound on the remainder of the complex exponential Taylor series.
- Theorem statement:
  `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_15413 (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) :
    Complex.abs (((Finset.range (n+1)).sum fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z) ≤
      (Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a complex number z and a natural number n, the absolute value (in ℝ) of the difference between the partial sum of the exponential series up to k = n, namely sum_{k=0}^n z^k / k!, and the complex exponential exp(z) is bounded above by (|z|)^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! times exp(|z|), where the right-hand side is taken in ℝ. Details:
  - `Finset.range (n+1)` indexes k = 0, 1, ..., n.
  - `z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)` matches z^k / k! with k! coerced to ℂ.
  - `Complex.exp z` is e^z in ℂ.
  - `Complex.abs (...)` is the modulus, yielding a real number.
  - RHS is `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`, i.e., |z|^{n+1} / (n+1)! * e^{|z|} in ℝ.
  There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation checking.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: For all z ∈ ℂ and all n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.
- Lean theorem precisely states this: the LHS is the absolute value of the remainder after truncating the series at n, and the RHS is |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! times e^{|z|}, all with correct types (ℂ on the LHS inside abs, ℝ on the RHS).
- Indexing from 0 to n via `Finset.range (n+1)` is correct.
- Factorials are correctly coerced to ℂ in the sum and to ℝ on the RHS.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same. There are no mismatches in quantification, indexing, operations, or types. The inequality direction and all constants match. No extraneous or missing conditions.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Translate each line of the Lean code:
- Variables: {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ}. So U is a subset of the complex numbers, and f is a function defined on all of ℂ.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U — f is complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic on U).
  - hfi : Function.Injective f — f is injective on all of ℂ.
- Conclusion: ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0 — for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and injective (injective as a function on its domain U). Conclude: f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean code differences:
  - Domain of f: The statement has f defined only on U, whereas the code takes f : ℂ → ℂ. This by itself can be acceptable if hypotheses are only on U, but it requires care with injectivity.
  - Injectivity: The statement requires injectivity on U (i.e., Set.InjOn f U or injective as a function f : U → ℂ). The code assumes global injectivity of f on ℂ (Function.Injective f), which is a strictly stronger hypothesis than needed.
  - Holomorphic: The code uses DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, which matches holomorphic on U.
  - Conclusion: Matches the desired nonvanishing derivative for all z ∈ U via deriv f z.

3) Final check of faithfulness:
- The code’s theorem is stronger than the natural language statement due to assuming global injectivity on ℂ instead of injectivity on U. A faithful translation should have either f : U → ℂ with injectivity, or f : ℂ → ℂ together with Set.InjOn f U. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present; the issue is solely the strengthened injectivity hypothesis and the mismatch in domain type.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The fix would be to replace Function.Injective f with Set.InjOn f U (or define f : U → ℂ and adjust differentiability/derivative accordingly).

  Natural language: For every complex number z, the complex arctangent function has derivative equal to 1 / (1 + z^2) at z. No domain restriction is assumed.

- theorem hasDerivAt_complex_log {z : ℂ} (hz : z ∈ Complex.slitPlane) : HasDerivAt Complex.log z⁻¹ z := by sorry
  Natural language: If z lies in the complex slit plane (the domain where the principal branch of log is defined), then the complex logarithm has derivative 1/z at z. This includes the correct domain restriction via z ∈ Complex.slitPlane.

2) Compare with the original statement:
Original: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that arctan' z = 1/(1+z^2) and log'(z) = 1/z where defined.” The key phrase “where defined” imposes domain restrictions: for log, one must be in the slit plane (excluding 0 and the branch cut); for arctan, one must exclude points where 1 + z^2 = 0 (i.e., z = ±i), or more precisely use the standard domain where Complex.arctan is holomorphic.

- The log part in Lean matches this: it requires z ∈ Complex.slitPlane and states the standard derivative 1/z.
- The arctan part in Lean does not include any hypothesis restricting z; it asserts the derivative formula holds at all z. This is too strong and not faithful to “where defined.” In mathlib, the correct formulation requires z ≠ I and z ≠ -I (or an equivalent domain condition), since 1 + z^2 = 0 at z = ±I and the derivative formula (and holomorphicity) fail there. Moreover, in Lean 1/(1 + z^2) evaluates to 0 at those points (since inv 0 = 0 by convention), so the statement is not just missing a hypothesis; it becomes false at those points.

3) Final check: The second theorem faithfully translates the log part. The first theorem does not faithfully translate the arctan part because it omits necessary domain conditions. Therefore, the overall translation is not faithful to the original statement.

No vacuous placeholders or bogus auxiliary definitions are present; the mismatch is purely the missing domain restriction for arctan.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language and assess.
- import Mathlib: Brings in mathlib, fine.
- variable {U : Set Complex} (hU : IsOpen U) {f g : Complex → Complex} (S : Set Complex) (x : Complex): Sets up variables: U ⊆ ℂ, a proof hU that U is open (but not used later), functions f,g: ℂ → ℂ (total functions), a subset S of ℂ, and a point x ∈ ℂ.
- def holomorphic_on (f : Complex → Complex) (U : Set Complex) : Prop := True: Defines a placeholder predicate for “f is holomorphic on U” as True. This is vacuous and not the real mathlib notion (which would be AnalyticOn ℂ f U or HolomorphicOn).
- def has_accumulation_point (S : Set Complex) (x : Complex) : Prop := True: Another placeholder predicate for “x is an accumulation point of S,” also vacuous and not tied to U. In mathlib, you would use IsAccumulationPoint S x (or related closure/cluster point notions).
- theorem identity_theorem ... : ∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z := by sorry: States that if f and g are “holomorphic on U” (under the placeholder), S ⊆ U, x is an “accumulation point” of S (again placeholder), and f = g on S, then f = g on U. No proof is provided (sorry), but the statement is present.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open; f,g: U → ℂ holomorphic; S ⊆ U has an accumulation point in U; if f = g on S then f ≡ g on U.
Lean theorem asserts essentially: If f,g are holomorphic on U (placeholder), S ⊆ U, there exists x with S accumulating at x (placeholder), and f = g on S, then f = g on U. However:
- The openness of U is not used in the theorem statement (hU is declared but not a hypothesis of the theorem). Thus the theorem does not encode “U is open.”
- The accumulation point condition is not encoded as “in U”; hacc is just has_accumulation_point S x without asserting x ∈ U. This misses a key part of the hypothesis.
- The definitions of holomorphic_on and has_accumulation_point are vacuous (both := True), making all hypotheses trivial. This violates the requirement for faithful definitions.
- Domain of f,g: The code uses f,g : ℂ → ℂ with a “holomorphic on U” predicate. This is a standard way to state such results in mathlib (holomorphicOn/analyticOn) and can be acceptable, but here the predicate itself is fake. In the original, f,g : U → ℂ; translating to ℂ → ℂ with a holomorphic-on-U predicate is fine in principle, but only if that predicate is correct.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- Major differences:
  - Vacuous auxiliary definitions: holomorphic_on and has_accumulation_point are defined as True. This makes the statement meaningless and not a faithful formalization of holomorphicity or accumulation points.
  - Missing use of U being open: hU exists but is not included in the theorem hypotheses; the statement does not enforce openness.
  - “Accumulation point in U” is not captured: the theorem has no condition x ∈ U.
- Minor difference:
  - f,g typed as ℂ → ℂ instead of U → ℂ. This could be fine if holomorphic_on were properly defined, but as written it is not the core problem.
- Connectivity: The natural language statement (as written) does not assume connectedness; neither does the code. While the classical identity theorem often assumes connectedness to conclude equality on all of U, here we judge translation fidelity, not mathematical correctness. Still, the code matches the (possibly too-strong) NL statement in this aspect.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation due to vacuous placeholder definitions and missing critical hypothesis details (openness not actually assumed in the theorem; accumulation point not asserted to lie in U). Even if the placeholders were replaced with real definitions, the theorem would still be missing the “x ∈ U” (accumulation point in U) and the explicit openness assumption, so it is not currently faithful.

- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib. OK.
- def holomorphic_on (U : Set ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True: This defines a placeholder predicate for “f is holomorphic on U” that is always true. This is a vacuous, fake definition, not Mathlib’s actual notion (e.g., AnalyticOn/holomorphicOn). Red flag.

The conclusion is only about the single set f(U), not about f mapping arbitrary open subsets of U to open sets.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open and f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f is an open mapping. The standard meaning: the map f: U → ℂ is an open map, i.e., for every open V ⊆ U, f(V) is open in ℂ. In Lean/Mathlib terms, this should be something like IsOpenMap (fun z : U => f z) or ∀ V, IsOpen V → V ⊆ U → IsOpen (f '' V).

Issues:
- The code’s holomorphic_on is a vacuous placeholder (= True). This violates the requirement to use legitimate definitions and makes the hypothesis meaningless.
- The conclusion IsOpen (f '' U) asserts only that the image of U itself is open, not that f is an open map on U. This is strictly weaker than the open mapping theorem.
- Domain mismatch: The NL statement has f : U → ℂ, while the code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with a predicate about holomorphic on U. While this can be an acceptable reformulation in principle, here it’s paired with the vacuous predicate, compounding the mismatch.
- The docstring itself incorrectly equates “f is an open mapping” with “f '' U is open,” reflecting the same weakening.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. Two major discrepancies:
1) The predicate for holomorphicity is vacuous, so the code does not faithfully capture holomorphicity.
2) The theorem only asserts openness of f(U), not that f maps every open subset of U to an open set. Even with a correct holomorphic predicate, the statement would still be too weak to express “f is an open mapping.”
Thus the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: There are vacuous definitions, and even if those were fixed, the final theorem would still not match the NL statement because it proves only IsOpen (f '' U) instead of IsOpenMap. This fits the rubric’s 3.

  (A) Holomorphic on a domain implies analytic. This is the local analyticity claim at each z0 ∈ U.
  (B) Given z0 ∈ U, f has a Taylor series that converges on the disk |z − z0| < R, where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum of the series equals f on that disk.
- The Lean statement captures only (A): it asserts AnalyticAt ℂ f z0 from DifferentiableOn ℂ f U with U open.
- It does not formalize (B): there is no mention of the radius of convergence equaling the distance to the nearest singularity, nor any maximality statement about the disk of convergence. AnalyticAt guarantees existence of some power series with positive radius and that the sum equals f locally (in some neighborhood), but it does not capture the precise radius R described (nearest singularity), nor that the equality holds up to that maximal radius.
- Additionally, the natural language says “on a domain U” (open and connected), whereas the Lean statement assumes only IsOpen U, not connectedness. This is not harmful for (A), but it diverges from the stated context.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem states only that holomorphic (DifferentiableOn on an open set) implies analytic at each point. The original statement further specifies the exact radius of convergence (distance to the nearest singularity) and that the series sums to f on the full disk up to that radius. The Lean code does not capture this radius/singularity aspect at all.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present; the Mathlib concepts used (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn, AnalyticAt) are standard and legitimate. However, the translation omits a substantial part of the original claim.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Theorem name: holomorphic_zero_isolated_or_constant.
- Parameters:
  - U : Set Complex — a subset of the complex numbers.
  - f : Complex → Complex — a function on all of ℂ (not restricted to U).
  - z0 c : Complex — points in ℂ.
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
  - hhol : True — placeholder intended to mean “f is holomorphic on U”, but it is vacuous.
  - hnc : True — placeholder intended to mean “f is nonconstant”, but it is vacuous.
  - hval : f z0 = c — f(z0) = c.
  - hder : True — placeholder intended to mean “f′(z0) = 0”, but it is vacuous.
- Conclusion: Either (∀ z, f z = c) — f is identically equal to c on all of ℂ — or there exist m : ℕ and V : Set Complex such that 1 ≤ m, IsOpen V, z0 ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and then two more conditions given as True ∧ True, which are unlabeled/vacuous placeholders (presumably for “z0 is a zero of f − c of order m” and “f⁻¹({c}) ∩ V consists of exactly m points counted with multiplicity”).
- Proof is by sorry (ignored in this auditing task).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: Let U ⊆ ℂ be a domain (open and connected) and f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant. If f(z0) = c and f′(z0) = 0, then either f ≡ c or else z0 is a zero of f − c of order m and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f⁻¹(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity).

Major discrepancies:
- Domain vs set: The code only assumes IsOpen U, not that U is a domain (open and connected; also typically nonempty). Missing connectedness (and nonemptiness if required by the intended definition).
- Function domain: Code uses f : ℂ → ℂ, whereas the statement has f : U → ℂ. The Lean statement quantifies and evaluates f everywhere on ℂ, not just on U, causing mismatches both in assumptions and conclusions.
- Holomorphic/nonconstant/derivative: All are replaced by True placeholders (hhol, hnc, hder), i.e., completely vacuous and do not constrain f.
- z0 ∈ U is not assumed; it’s only indirectly implied in the second disjunct by z0 ∈ V and V ⊆ U, but not required in the assumptions where f(z0) and f′(z0) are used.
- Constant alternative: The code states ∀ z, f z = c on all ℂ, whereas the original means f ≡ c on U. This is strictly stronger and incorrect.
- Multiplicity and zero order: The critical content “z0 is a zero of f − c of order m” and “f⁻¹(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity)” are replaced by True ∧ True. These are vacuous and do not encode the intended notions at all.

Step 3: Final check — are the problems the same?
They are different.
- The code lacks the essential analytic hypotheses (holomorphic on U, derivative at z0 in the right sense, nonconstant) and replaces them with True.
- The conclusion about constancy is stated over all ℂ, not just U.
- The crucial multiplicity and order-of-zero statements are not formalized.
- The notion of domain is weakened to merely open.
- The function’s domain mismatch (f : ℂ → ℂ instead of f : U → ℂ or f considered with DifferentiableOn U) further diverges from the intended statement.

Because of these substantial mismatches and especially the use of vacuous placeholders for the core analytic content, the Lean code is not a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem discrete_set_of_deriv_eq_zero {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (h : ¬∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c) : ...` translates to: Let U be an open subset of ℂ and let f: ℂ → ℂ be a function that is complex differentiable on U. Assume f is not constant on U (i.e., there does not exist c such that for all z ∈ U, f z = c).
- The conclusion `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z = 0 → ∃ ε > 0, (Metric.ball z ε ∩ U ∩ {w | deriv f w = 0}) = {z}` translates to: For every z ∈ U with f'(z) = 0, there exists ε > 0 such that the intersection of the open ε-ball around z with U and the set of zeros of the derivative equals exactly the singleton {z}. Equivalently: each zero of f' in U is isolated relative to U.

2) Comparing with the natural language statement:
- NL: U ⊂ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f not constant. Show { z ∈ U : f'(z) = 0 } is discrete in U.
- Lean uses f: ℂ → ℂ with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`. This is a standard and faithful formalization of “holomorphic on U” in mathlib. The non-constancy is expressed as ¬∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c, which matches “f is not constant (on U).”
- The conclusion explicitly encodes discreteness in U: for each zero z of f' in U, there is an ε-ball whose intersection with U and the zero set contains only z. This matches the usual definition of a discrete subset of U (each point of the subset is isolated in the subspace topology on U).
- Using `deriv f` (the complex derivative) is appropriate since U is open and `DifferentiableOn` holds on U; and the set under consideration is intersected with U, so there’s no issue with points outside U.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain mismatch: NL has f: U → ℂ; Lean has f: ℂ → ℂ with differentiability on U. This is a standard equivalence in mathlib and does not change the meaning.
- Definition of discreteness: The Lean statement uses an explicit metric-ball formulation that is equivalent to discreteness in U. No mismatch.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard mathlib notions. No extra or missing assumptions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- Variables: U ⊆ ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, p ∈ ℂ, f' ∈ ℂ.
- Hypotheses: (i) U is open; (ii) p ∈ U; (iii) f has complex derivative f' at p, i.e., HasDerivAt f f' p; (iv) f' ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: There exists a set V ⊆ ℂ such that V is open, p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, f(V) is open, and f is injective on V (i.e., ∀ x,y ∈ V, f x = f y → x = y).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Original: U ⊆ ℂ is open, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then ∃ an open neighborhood V of p such that f(V) is open and f|_V is injective.

3) Differences:
- Domain of f: The original has f defined only on U (f : U → ℂ). The Lean code assumes f : ℂ → ℂ (globally defined). While the conclusion only uses V ⊆ U (which the Lean code enforces), the hypothesis in Lean does not encode that f is only defined on U; this is acceptable as a modeling choice only if the analytic hypothesis is correctly scoped to U.
- Holomorphic assumption: The original requires f to be holomorphic on U (i.e., complex differentiable in a neighborhood of each point in U). The Lean code only assumes HasDerivAt f f' p at the single point p. This is strictly weaker and does not capture “f is holomorphic on U.” The theorem in the code is therefore much stronger than the original claim and not faithful to the stated assumptions.
- Regularity near p: The original statement needs holomorphicity (hence differentiability on a neighborhood) to guarantee both openness of f(V) and injectivity on V via the inverse function theorem/open mapping theorem. The Lean statement lacks any neighborhood differentiability/holomorphic assumption—only a pointwise derivative—which is insufficient and thus a mismatch in meaning.
- Extra constraint V ⊆ U: The Lean code requires V ⊆ U. The original doesn’t explicitly say this, but since U is open and p ∈ U, one can (and usually does) choose V ⊆ U. This strengthening is fine.

4) Use of Mathlib notions:
- They use HasDerivAt, which is a standard Mathlib notion for complex differentiability at a point (over base field ℂ). However, they do not use Complex.DifferentiableOn/HolomorphicOn or HasDerivAt within a set (HasDerivAt within U), which would be the correct way to encode “f is holomorphic on U” for f : ℂ → ℂ or for f : U → ℂ via subtype. This is a red flag for faithfulness.

Final check: The mathematical statements are different. The Lean code asserts a result under strictly weaker hypotheses (only pointwise derivative at p) than the original (holomorphic on the open set U). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem exists_delta_open_on_punctured_ball {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hUconn : IsConnected U)` says: Let U be a subset of ℂ, open and connected.
- `{f : ℂ → ℂ} (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)` says: f is a function ℂ → ℂ that is complex-differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U).
- `(h_nonconst : ∃ x y, x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ U ∧ f x ≠ f y)` says: f is nonconstant on U.
- `(p : ℂ) (hp : p ∈ U)` says: p is a point of U.
- Conclusion: `∃ δ > 0, IsOpenMap (fun z : {z : ℂ // z ∈ ball p δ \ {p}} => f z.val)` says: there exists δ > 0 such that the restriction of f to the subtype domain ball p δ minus {p} is an open map (with the subtype topology).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL statement: U ⊂ ℂ open and connected; f: U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant; p ∈ U; then ∃ δ > 0 such that f restricted to Δ_δ(p) \ {p} is an open map.
- The code models holomorphicity correctly via `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` and nonconstancy on U. The domain of the function in the conclusion is the punctured open ball around p.

Step 3: Check for (in)faithfulness and differences.
- Major mismatch: In the NL statement, f has domain U, so the phrase ""f restricted to Δ_δ(p) \ {p}"" only makes sense if Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U. Implicitly, one must choose δ so that the ball lies inside U. The Lean statement does not require `ball p δ ⊆ U` nor does it intersect the domain with U. It asserts the restriction of f (viewed as a function on all ℂ) to the entire punctured ball is an open map. This is strictly stronger and not equivalent to the original statement.
- Domain of f: NL uses f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability on U. This would be acceptable if the conclusion restricted to a subset of U (e.g., by requiring `ball p δ ⊆ U` or using the domain `{z | z ∈ ball p δ \ {p} ∧ z ∈ U}`). As written, it does not, so the translation fails.
- Other aspects match: openness, connectedness, holomorphicity, nonconstancy, and the use of IsOpenMap for the restricted function are appropriate.

Final check: The two statements are different. The Lean code omits the crucial inclusion `ball p δ ⊆ U` (or an equivalent domain intersection), thereby changing the domain on which the open map property is asserted. Hence, it is not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `U : Set ℂ`, `z0 : ℂ`, `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
- Hypotheses:
  - `hU : IsOpen U` means U is open in ℂ.
  - `hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U` means f is holomorphic (complex-analytic) on U.
  - `h_nonconst : ∃ w ∈ U, f w ≠ f z0` together with `hz0 : z0 ∈ U` encodes that f is not constant on U (indeed, there is at least one point w in U where f(w) differs from f(z0), so f takes at least two distinct values on U).
  - `hder : deriv f z0 = 0` says f'(z0) = 0.
- Conclusion:
  - There exist an integer `n : ℕ`, an open set `V : Set ℂ` with `IsOpen V ∧ z0 ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U`, and a function `g : ℂ → ℂ` such that `AnalyticOn ℂ g V` (g is holomorphic on V), `g z0 ≠ 0`, `0 < n`, and for all `z ∈ V`, `deriv f z = (z - z0) ^ n * g z`.
  - This is the standard formalization that f' has a zero of finite order n at z0: f'(z) factors as (z − z0)^n times a holomorphic function nonvanishing at z0 on a neighborhood of z0.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: U is open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f is not constant, and f'(z0) = 0. Conclude: z0 is a zero of f' of some finite order.
- Lean hypotheses match:
  - Open set (IsOpen U) and holomorphic on U (AnalyticOn ℂ f U) match “U open” and “f holomorphic on U”.
  - Nonconstancy is modeled by `∃ w ∈ U, f w ≠ f z0` (with `z0 ∈ U` given). This is equivalent to “f is not constant on U” since if f were constant on U, then f(w) = f(z0) for all w ∈ U, contradicting the hypothesis; conversely, nonconstancy ensures some w with f(w) ≠ f(z0).
  - `deriv f z0 = 0` is exactly f'(z0) = 0.
- Lean conclusion is the usual precise definition of “z0 is a zero of f' of some finite order”: existence of n ≥ 1 and a holomorphic g nonvanishing at z0 such that f' = (· − z0)^n g on a neighborhood of z0. The inclusion `V ⊆ U` is a natural and correct restriction since f is only assumed analytic on U.

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no placeholders. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions: `AnalyticOn`, `IsOpen`, `deriv`, `⊆`, etc.
- Using f : ℂ → ℂ together with `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` faithfully models a holomorphic function f: U → ℂ.
- The added local neighborhood data and factorization are exactly the formal meaning of “finite order zero”.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. The hypotheses and the conclusion match in mathematical meaning. There are no extraneous or vacuous parts, and the formulation is standard and precise.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Just imports and opens the Complex namespace; fine.
- `def Domain (U : Set ℂ) : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate `Domain` on subsets of ℂ but defines it as `True`, i.e., every set is a domain. The comment says it should mean ""open connected subset of ℂ,"" but the actual definition is vacuous and does not enforce openness or connectedness.
- `def HolomorphicOn (U : Set ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate `HolomorphicOn` but defines it as `True`, i.e., every function on every set is holomorphic. The comment claims it should mean ""f is holomorphic on U""; the actual definition is vacuous. Also, this shadows existing Mathlib notions (`Complex.DifferentiableOn`, `HolomorphicOn` in mathlib), which is a red flag.
- Theorem `holomorphic_implies_analytic (U : Set ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hU : Domain U) (hf : HolomorphicOn U f) : ∀ z, z ∈ U → ∃ (a : ℕ → ℂ) (r : ℝ), r = 0 ∧ True := by sorry`:
  Natural language: For every z ∈ U, there exist coefficients a: ℕ → ℂ and a radius r: ℝ such that r = 0 and (some unspecified condition, since it is `∧ True`). There is no mention of a power series summing to f, no statement about radius equaling the distance to the nearest singularity or to ℂ \ U, and in fact it claims r = 0, which is contrary to the intended statement except in trivial edge cases. Also, f is typed as ℂ → ℂ rather than f : U → ℂ or a function defined on ℂ restricted to U, so the domain of f is misrepresented.

2) Does the full translation match the original NL statement?
- Original: U is a domain (open and connected) and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic. Show f is analytic on U: for each z ∈ U, f has a Taylor series expansion around z with radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (typically dist(z, ℂ \ U) if only holomorphic on U), and the series sums to f on the corresponding disk.
- Lean code problems:
  - The predicates `Domain` and `HolomorphicOn` are vacuous (defined as True). This alone breaks faithfulness.
  - The theorem claims existence of a sequence and a radius r equal to 0, with no content besides `∧ True`. This neither encodes analyticity, nor the summation property, nor the radius-of-convergence property. It contradicts the intended property by forcing r = 0.
  - f is a function ℂ → ℂ rather than U → ℂ, misrepresenting the statement.
  - No Mathlib constructs for analyticity are used (e.g., `AnalyticAt`, `AnalyticOn`, `HasFPowerSeriesOnBall`, or a statement about radius `r = infEdist z (ℂ \ U)`), and the code defines placeholders instead of using existing notions.
  - There is no mention of power series summation to f or of the radius being the distance to the nearest singularity.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code’s theorem is drastically weaker (indeed vacuous) and factually wrong relative to the intended meaning: it states an existence of a sequence and radius r = 0 with no connection to f being holomorphic, no power series, no equality to f, and no radius property. Moreover, it uses vacuous placeholder predicates. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Summary of discrepancies:
- Vacuous placeholder definitions for key notions.
- Wrong domain type for f (ℂ → ℂ instead of U → ℂ or appropriate restriction).
- The theorem concludes r = 0 (incorrect) and omits the power series and summation-to-f conditions.
- Does not express radius equals distance to nearest singularity / complement.
- Does not use standard Mathlib notions for holomorphy/analyticity.

Given these issues, the translation fails under the provided strict guidelines.

- Conclusion: ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ Set.InjOn f V: there exists an open set V in ℂ containing p such that f is injective when restricted to V (i.e., f is injective on the set V).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open, p ∈ U, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(p) ≠ 0. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that the restriction of f to V is injective.

Matching points:
- U open, p ∈ U: matches hU, hp.
- f holomorphic on U: DifferentiableOn ℂ f U is the standard Mathlib way to encode holomorphicity on U.
- f'(p) ≠ 0: deriv f p ≠ 0 matches the complex derivative at p (since U is open and f is differentiable on U, the within-derivative equals the usual deriv).
- Injectivity of the restriction: Set.InjOn f V correctly expresses that f restricted to V is injective.

Discrepancies:
- Domain of f: The natural statement has f : U → ℂ, i.e., f is only defined on U. The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ and only assumes differentiability on U. This is a common modeling choice and would be fine if the conclusion only involved V ⊆ U.
- Missing inclusion V ⊆ U: The natural statement implicitly requires V ⊆ U (since f is only defined on U). The Lean statement concludes the existence of an open V containing p with injectivity, but does not require V ⊆ U. This is a genuine mismatch. Because f is arbitrary outside U, asserting injectivity on a V that may extend outside U is not what the original statement says; the original requires an open neighborhood of p inside U. The Lean conclusion is strictly different (and in fact potentially stronger in an unintended way) and omits a key constraint.

Step 3: Final check
The two statements are not the same: the Lean version lacks the requirement V ⊆ U, while the natural statement (with f : U → ℂ) demands it. Everything else aligns. Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful.

Grade rationale: Almost perfect except for the missing V ⊆ U and the modeling of f as ℂ → ℂ instead of U → ℂ. The former is a substantive mismatch in the conclusion, so it cannot be marked faithful, but it's close. Hence grade 9.

- `theorem inj_on_ball_of_hasDerivAt_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {p f' : ℂ} (h : HasDerivAt f f' p) (hne : f' ≠ 0) : ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ Set.InjOn f (Metric.ball p δ)`
  Natural language: Let f: ℂ → ℂ, and let p, f' ∈ ℂ. If f has complex derivative f' at p (HasDerivAt f f' p) and f' ≠ 0, then there exists δ > 0 such that f is injective on the open ball centered at p of radius δ in ℂ.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original: U ⊂ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic on U, p ∈ U, f'(p) ≠ 0. Then for sufficiently small δ > 0, the restriction of f to the open disc Δ_δ(p) is injective (implicitly with Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U).

Differences:
- Domain: The Lean statement assumes f is defined on all of ℂ; the original allows an arbitrary open subset U ⊂ ℂ. The Lean result is only a special case with U = ℂ.
- Regularity assumptions: The original assumes f is holomorphic on an open set U (i.e., differentiable on a neighborhood of p). The Lean statement only assumes HasDerivAt at the single point p, with no neighborhood holomorphy/differentiability. This is a substantial weakening of hypotheses and changes the mathematical content.
- Containment of the ball: The original implicitly requires δ small enough that the disc lies in U. The Lean statement has no such constraint (since U is not present), which changes the statement for general U.
- Conclusion: Both assert injectivity of f on a small open disc/ball around p, which matches in form, but the hypotheses differ significantly.

Step 3: Final check: Are they the same?
No. The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It (i) specializes the domain to ℂ rather than an arbitrary open subset U, and (ii) weakens the holomorphic assumption from ""holomorphic on U"" to merely ""HasDerivAt at p"". The latter is a major change: the classical result requires holomorphicity in a neighborhood, not just differentiability at a point. Therefore the Lean statement is strictly different from and stronger than the original claim, and does not faithfully encode it.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholders; it uses real Mathlib notions. However, the mismatch in hypotheses (missing open domain U and holomorphic-on-U assumption) is substantial, so the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {f : ℂ → ℂ} {L : ℂ}`: We have a complex-valued function f on ℂ and a complex number L.
- The theorem `tendsto_cocompact_iff_metric` states: `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.cocompact ℂ) (nhds L)` if and only if for every real ε > 0, there exists a real M such that for all z ∈ ℂ, if ‖z‖ > M then ‖f z − L‖ < ε.
- Here, `Filter.cocompact ℂ` is the cocompact filter on ℂ (complements of compact sets), which represents approaching the point at infinity in the one-point compactification (Riemann sphere sense). `nhds L` is the usual neighborhood filter at L in ℂ. `Norm.norm` is the complex absolute value.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “Suppose L ∈ ℂ. Show that lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z)−L| < ε whenever |z| > M.”
- In Lean, “z → ∞ in the Riemann sphere” is encoded as `Filter.cocompact ℂ` on the domain, and tending to L in ℂ is `nhds L`. The right-hand side is exactly the ε–M condition using the Euclidean norm on ℂ: for sufficiently large |z|, f(z) is within ε of L.
- Over ℂ, closed balls are compact, so the cocompact filter is generated by complements of large closed balls, making the ε–M condition equivalent to convergence along the cocompact filter. Thus the equivalence aligns precisely with the NL statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain: f : ℂ → ℂ, L ∈ ℂ. Matches.
- “In the sense of the Riemann sphere”: represented by `Filter.cocompact ℂ`. Matches.
- ε–M formulation: exactly as stated, with `|z| > M` and `|f(z) − L| < ε`. Matches.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The statement is a direct equivalence and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Context: U ⊆ ℂ is open (hU : IsOpen U). f : ℂ → ℂ is a function that is complex differentiable on U (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U). p ∈ U (hp). The complex derivative deriv f p ≠ 0 (h).
- Conclusion asserted by the theorem:
  There exist sets V and W such that V ∈ 𝓝 p (V is a neighborhood of p) and W ∈ 𝓝 (f p) (W is a neighborhood of f p), and there exists a function g : ℂ → ℂ with the following properties:
  • g is bijective on the entire ℂ (Bijective g).
  • For all z ∈ V, g z ∈ W.
  • For all z ∈ V, g (f z) = z (left-inverse identity on V).
  • For all z ∈ W, f (g z) = z (right-inverse identity on W).
  • g is complex differentiable on U (DifferentiableOn ℂ g U).

Step 2: Compare with the original natural language statement.
Original: If U ⊆ ℂ is open, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U, then there exist neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p) such that f : V → W is a bijection and f^{-1} is holomorphic.

Key intended meaning: There are open neighborhoods V ⊆ U of p and W of f(p) so that the restriction f|_V : V → W is a bijection with inverse g = (f|_V)^{-1} : W → V, and g is holomorphic on W.

Step 3: Identify mismatches.
- Global bijectivity of g: The code asserts the existence of a global bijection g : ℂ → ℂ. The theorem only guarantees a local inverse g : W → V, not a global bijection ℂ → ℂ. This is far stronger than the original and generally false/unnecessary.
- Wrong differentiability domain for the inverse: The original requires the inverse (defined on W) to be holomorphic on W. The code requires DifferentiableOn ℂ g U, i.e., g holomorphic on U, which is the wrong set and the wrong direction. It says nothing about g being holomorphic on W.
- Missing and wrong mapping inclusions:
  • To capture f : V → W, we need ∀ z ∈ V, f z ∈ W. The code does not include this.
  • To capture g : W → V, we need ∀ w ∈ W, g w ∈ V. The code instead has ∀ z ∈ V, g z ∈ W, i.e., g maps V into W, which reverses the needed inclusion.
- Inverse identities are given on the correct subsets (g ∘ f = id on V and f ∘ g = id on W), but without the proper domain/codomain inclusions, they do not express that f|_V is a bijection V → W and that g is its inverse W → V.
- f's domain: The original has f : U → ℂ; the code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. This is acceptable as a modeling choice, but then one must enforce V ⊆ U to ensure we are in the domain where f is holomorphic. The code does not require V ⊆ U.
- Neighborhoods being open: The code uses V ∈ 𝓝 p and W ∈ 𝓝 (f p), which is acceptable as a notion of neighborhood (not necessarily open), but this is minor compared to the major mismatches above.

Step 4: Final check.
The Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the original theorem. It strengthens and distorts the claim in several crucial ways (global bijectivity of g, wrong differentiability set, wrong mapping inclusions, failure to assert f|_V : V → W is the bijection). Therefore, the translation fails.

- Context: U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. A function f : ℂ → ℂ with hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (i.e., f is holomorphic on U). c : ℂ.
- The theorem states two conjuncts:
  (A) For every p with p ∈ U and f p = c, there exists δ > 0 such that, for all z, if z ∈ U ∩ Metric.ball p δ and z ≠ p, then f z ≠ c. In words: each zero p of f − c in U is isolated; in a small neighborhood around p inside U, p is the only zero.
  (B) For every p with p ∈ U and f p = c, there exist δ > 0, k : ℕ, and g : ℂ → ℂ such that g is holomorphic on Metric.ball p δ (DifferentiableOn ℂ g (Metric.ball p δ)), and for all z ∈ Metric.ball p δ we have f z − c = (z − p)^k * g z, and moreover g p ≠ 0. In words: near p, we can factor f(z) − c as (z − p)^k times a holomorphic function g with g(p) ≠ 0, on some open disk centered at p.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL: “Suppose U ⊂ ℂ is open, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic, and c ∈ ℂ. Then { z ∈ U : f(z) = c } is a discrete set.”
  Lean (A): For any p with f p = c, there is δ > 0 such that in U ∩ ball(p, δ) the only zero is p. This is exactly the definition that the zero set is discrete in U: each point of the subset has a neighborhood in ℂ whose intersection with the subset is {p}.
- NL: “Furthermore, if p ∈ U and f(p) = c, then there exists δ > 0 and a holomorphic g : Δ_δ(p) → ℂ such that g is not identically zero, f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z) for all z ∈ Δ_δ(p), and g(p) ≠ 0, where k ∈ ℕ is fixed.”
  Lean (B): There exist δ > 0, k : ℕ, and g holomorphic on the open ball Metric.ball p δ with f z − c = (z − p)^k * g z for all z in that ball, and g p ≠ 0. This matches the standard factorization: g holomorphic on the disk, g(p) ≠ 0, with a fixed integer k and the stated equality. The Lean statement does not explicitly say “g is not identically zero”, but g(p) ≠ 0 implies that anyway, so it’s stronger.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: NL has f : U → ℂ holomorphic. Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This is a standard and faithful rephrasing; the statements only use f on neighborhoods contained in U.
- Scope of the factorization equality: Lean states the equality on the whole ball Metric.ball p δ (not intersected with U). Since U is open, one can choose δ so that the ball is contained in U, so this is consistent and in fact aligns with the NL statement (Δ_δ(p) is an open disk). No loss of faithfulness.
- The discrete set part is expressed via isolation of each zero, which is exactly the meaning of discreteness for the subset {z ∈ U | f z = c}.
- The requirement g(p) ≠ 0 (included in Lean) automatically implies g is not identically zero (requested in NL), so nothing is missing.
- The quantifier “k ∈ ℕ is fixed” is realized as an existential k that works uniformly for all z in the ball.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement with standard formalization choices. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used, and there are no mismatched or missing conditions.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`, `open Filter`: setup.
- `variable {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ}`: f is a complex function, z0 a complex point.
- Theorem statement:
  Left side: `Tendsto (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) (nhds z0) atTop` means: as z tends to z0 (with the neighborhood filter `nhds z0`), the real-valued function |f(z)| tends to +∞ (filter `atTop`). In words: |f(z)| → ∞ as z → z0.
  Right side: `∀ M : ℝ, M > 0 → ∃ δ : ℝ, δ > 0 ∧ ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs (z - z0) < δ → Complex.abs (f z) > M` means: for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with |z − z0| < δ, we have |f(z)| > M.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claims an iff between: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the Riemann sphere sense” and the ε–δ condition “for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z − z0| < δ”. Mathematically, f(z) → ∞ in the Riemann sphere is equivalent to |f(z)| → +∞, so replacing the left side by `Tendsto (|f|) ... atTop` is acceptable as a logically equivalent reformulation.

Crucial mismatches:
- Punctured neighborhood vs. full neighborhood:
  • The standard limit as z → z0 (and the Riemann sphere notion) should use punctured neighborhoods: 0 < |z − z0| < δ. The Lean right-hand side omits the “0 <” and requires the bound to hold even at z = z0. This is strictly stronger than the usual definition.
  • Correspondingly, the left-hand side uses `nhds z0` (full neighborhood filter) rather than the punctured neighborhood filter `𝓝[≠] z0` (i.e., `nhdsWithin z0 {z | z ≠ z0}`). This again imposes a stronger condition that includes the point z0 itself.
- These two issues mean the Lean statement does not faithfully capture the usual “limit as z → z0” notion; it instead asserts a stronger property that forces the same behavior at z = z0.

Other observations:
- Not explicitly using the Riemann sphere is fine because “f → ∞ on the sphere” is equivalent to “|f| → +∞”.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present.

Final check: The math problems are different. The Lean theorem asserts |f(z)| → ∞ with respect to the full neighborhood filter and requires the δ–condition without excluding z = z0, whereas the original statement uses the punctured notion of limit. Hence, the translation is not faithful.

  This states: s is closed if and only if for every sequence u: ℕ → α and every point x ∈ α, if every term of u lies in s and u converges to x (Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)), then x ∈ s.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S.
- The Lean statement captures exactly this: “sequence in S” is `(∀ n, u n ∈ s)`, “converges in X” is `Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)` for some x ∈ α, and “has its limit in S” is `x ∈ s`. The biconditional (↔) matches “if and only if”. The metric space hypothesis is present. The use of filters is standard for expressing sequence convergence in Mathlib.
- Quantifying over all x and requiring `Tendsto u … (nhds x)` precisely encodes: if u converges (to some x), then that limit x is in s. There is no unintended strengthening or weakening.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p, with V ⊆ U, such that f is injective on V (i.e., for all x, y ∈ V, if f x = f y then x = y).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- First part (open mapping): The NL statement assumes U ⊂ ℂ is open and connected, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant, and concludes f(U) is open. The Lean theorem uses U open and connected, a function f : ℂ → ℂ that is complex differentiable on U (equivalent to holomorphic on U), and explicitly asserts nonconstancy on U. Conclusion IsOpen (f '' U) matches f(U) open. This is a faithful translation.

- Second part (local injectivity where f'(p) ≠ 0): The NL statement says f is locally injective at points p with f'(p) ≠ 0. The Lean theorem states: if U is open, p ∈ U, f is complex-differentiable on U, and the derivative exists at p and is nonzero, then there is an open neighborhood V ⊆ U of p on which f is injective. This exactly formalizes local injectivity at points with nonzero derivative. The Lean version uses slightly weaker global hypotheses (it does not assume connectedness or nonconstancy, which are unnecessary for this local fact), but under the original assumptions these are automatically satisfied. The quantification is per-point, as expected. The existence of the derivative is included together with the nonzero condition, matching the usual meaning of “where f'(p) ≠ 0”. The conclusion explicitly gives a neighborhood V where the restriction is injective.

3) Final check: The two math problems are the same.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only theorem statements with omitted proofs.
- The first theorem is a faithful formalization of the open mapping theorem in the stated context.
- The second theorem faithfully captures local injectivity at points with nonzero derivative. The hypotheses are not stronger than in the NL statement (indeed they are weaker, which does not distort the original claim and still covers it). The formalization of injectivity on a neighborhood is standard and correct.
No mismatches were found that would affect faithfulness.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem exists_compact_exhaustion_of_open_complex {U : Set Complex} (hU : IsOpen U) :` 
  Natural language: Let U ⊆ ℂ be an open set.
- `∃ (K : ℕ → Set Complex),` 
  There exists a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of subsets K_n of ℂ.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n)) ∧` 
  For all n, K_n is compact.
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))) ∧` 
  For all n, K_n is contained in the interior of K_{n+1} (interiors taken in ℂ). This matches K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}^∘.
- `U = ⋃ n, interior (K n) ∧` 
  U equals the union over n of the interiors of K_n.
- `∀ n, ∃ (s : Finset (Complex × ℝ)), K n ⊆ ⋃ p ∈ s, closedBall p.1 p.2 ∧ (⋃ p ∈ s, closedBall p.1 p.2) ⊆ interior (K (n+1))` 
  For each n, there exists a finite set s of pairs (center, radius) such that K_n is contained in the union of the corresponding closed balls (i.e., closed disks in ℂ) and this union is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL: U ⊆ ℂ open. Lean: yes, `IsOpen U`.
- NL: There exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U. Lean: `∀ n, IsCompact (K n)` and also the other conditions imply K_n ⊆ U: from `U = ⋃ n interior (K n)` we get `interior (K (n+1)) ⊆ U` for each n, and from `K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))`, it follows that `K n ⊆ U`. So K_n are compact subsets of U. This matches.
- NL: K_n ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘. Lean: `K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))`. Uses ⊆ rather than strict ⊂; this is standard and faithful for such exhaustions (strictness is not essential and often not required). 
- NL: U = ⋃ K_n^∘. Lean: exactly `U = ⋃ n, interior (K n)`.
- NL: For each n there exists a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊆ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊆ K_{n+1}^∘. Lean: For each n there exists a finite set `s : Finset (Complex × ℝ)` such that `K n ⊆ ⋃ p∈s, closedBall p.1 p.2` and that union is ⊆ `interior (K (n+1))`. This is a faithful formalization of a finite collection of closed disks in ℂ.

Step 3: Final check and possible differences.
- Indexing starts at n = 0 in Lean versus n = 1 in the NL text. This is immaterial for an existential statement about a sequence; reindexing is harmless.
- The Lean code allows radii r ∈ ℝ (including possibly negative), but existence of such a finite covering implies one can choose nonnegative radii; allowing more general r does not weaken the statement since negative radii yield empty balls and do not prevent existence of a valid finite covering. Thus this is still faithful.
- The requirement that K_n are subsets of U is not stated explicitly, but is implied by the given conditions as noted above.
- All concepts used (IsOpen, IsCompact, interior, closedBall, finite unions via Finset) are standard Mathlib concepts and appropriate for the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement with no vacuous placeholders, and all parts match in mathematical meaning.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Inputs: U : Set Complex, f : Complex → Complex, p : Complex, with assumptions:
  - hU : IsOpen U (U is open in ℂ).
  - hf : DifferentiableOn Complex f U (f is holomorphic on U).
  - hp : p ∈ U.
  - hfp : deriv f p ≠ 0 (the complex derivative of f at p is nonzero; this is well-defined since hf gives differentiability at p).
- Conclusion: There exist V, W : Set Complex, and g : Complex → Complex such that:
  - IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W (V and W are open).
  - p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U (V is an open neighborhood of p contained in U).
  - f '' V = W (W is exactly the image f(V)).
  - ∀ x1 x2, x1 ∈ V → x2 ∈ V → f x1 = f x2 → x1 = x2 (f is injective on V).
  - ∀ y, y ∈ W → f (g y) = y and ∀ x, x ∈ V → g (f x) = x (g is a two-sided inverse to f restricted to V and W).
  - DifferentiableOn Complex g W (g is holomorphic on W).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: Given U open in ℂ, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U, there exist open sets V, W ⊆ ℂ with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, and f|_V injective with a holomorphic inverse.
- The Lean code models f as a total function ℂ → ℂ that is holomorphic on U (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U), which is standard in Mathlib and faithful to “f : U → ℂ holomorphic.”
- Nonvanishing derivative at p is expressed as deriv f p ≠ 0; since p ∈ U and f is differentiable on U, this is legitimate.
- The existence of open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f '' V = W matches “there exist open sets V, W ⊆ ℂ with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W.”
- Injectivity of f|_V is explicitly stated.
- Existence of a holomorphic inverse is encoded by a function g with f ∘ g = id on W, g ∘ f = id on V, and DifferentiableOn ℂ g W. From W = f''V and g(f x) = x (for x ∈ V), it follows that g maps W into V, so g : W → V is indeed the inverse of f|_V. Thus the “holomorphic inverse” requirement is faithfully captured.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same statement?
- No extraneous assumptions are added; no key hypotheses are missing.
- All essential conclusions (existence of V, W; injectivity; equality f(V) = W; holomorphic inverse) are present.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only standard Mathlib notions appear.
- The two identities ensure g is actually the inverse on the stated domains, and DifferentiableOn ℂ g W gives holomorphicity.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The theorem is named `lift_angle_for_simple_closed_curve` with parameters a, b : ℝ, γ : ℝ → ℂ, θ : ℝ → ℝ.
- Assumptions:
  - `h_cont : ContinuousOn γ (Set.Icc a b)`: γ is continuous on the closed interval [a,b].
  - `h_nonzero : ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc a b, γ t ≠ 0`: γ never hits 0 on [a,b].
  - `h_theta : ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc a b, Complex.exp (Complex.I * θ t) = γ t / (Complex.abs (γ t) : ℝ)`: for all t ∈ [a,b], e^{i θ(t)} equals γ(t)/|γ(t)|.
  - `is_simple : Prop`: an arbitrary proposition (intended to represent “γ is simple”), but not tied to γ.
  - `origin_in_region : Prop`: an arbitrary proposition (intended to represent “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ”), but not defined.
- Conclusion: There exists `tilde_θ : ℝ → ℝ` such that
  - For all t ∈ [a,b], `exp(i tilde_θ(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)|`.
  - `tilde_θ(a) = θ(a)`.
  - `(tilde_θ(b) = tilde_θ(a) + 2π) ↔ origin_in_region`.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement:
- γ : [a,b] → ℂ \ {0} is a piecewise smooth curve, simple, does not pass through the origin (hence nonzero), and θ : [a,b] → ℝ is continuous with e^{iθ(t)} = γ(t)/|γ(t)|.
- There exists \tilde θ : [a,b] → ℝ with the same exponential property and \tilde θ(a) = θ(a).
- Moreover, \tilde θ(b) = \tilde θ(a) + 2π iff the origin is inside the region bounded by γ.

Mismatches and issues:
- Piecewise smoothness: The code only assumes `ContinuousOn γ` on [a,b], not piecewise smoothness. This is a weakening and omits a key hypothesis from the original.
- Simplicity (and closedness): The code introduces `is_simple : Prop` but does not connect it to γ nor use it. It also does not assume γ is closed (γ(a) = γ(b)), which is implicit in talking about the “region bounded by γ” (Jordan curve). This is a significant omission.
- Region bounded by γ / origin in region: The code uses an arbitrary `origin_in_region : Prop` with no definition linking it to γ. This is a vacuous placeholder, not a faithful translation of “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ.”
- Continuity of θ: The original assumes θ is continuous; the code does not state this, only the relation `exp(i θ) = γ/|γ|`.
- Domain types: The original functions are on [a,b]. The code uses total functions ℝ → ℂ/ℝ and constrains them on Set.Icc a b. This is acceptable as a modeling choice if the properties are restricted to [a,b], which they are.
- Existence of \tilde θ: The code does not require \tilde θ to be continuous. The original also does not explicitly state continuity of \tilde θ, so this is acceptable, though typically intended.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two problems the same?
No. The Lean theorem is not a faithful translation. It omits essential hypotheses (piecewise smoothness, simplicity, closedness; continuity of θ) and replaces the geometric condition “origin is inside the region bounded by γ” with an arbitrary, unrelated proposition `origin_in_region`. The inclusion of `is_simple : Prop` without definition or use further indicates a placeholder rather than a proper formalization. Therefore, the translation fails.

Grade justification:
- There are vacuous placeholders for key notions (origin inside region, simplicity), and several hypotheses are missing. If these were replaced with proper mathlib notions (e.g., a definition of a simple closed piecewise smooth curve, and a precise predicate capturing “origin inside the Jordan interior of γ”), and continuity of θ were assumed, then the theorem statement would align with the original. Hence, while unfaithful as-is, it is structurally close enough that fixing placeholders could make it faithful. This warrants a mid-level grade.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- Docstring: States that if (a_n) is absolutely summable and (b_n) is summable over ℝ, then the Cauchy product c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} is summable.
- Theorem `cauchy_product_summable_of_abs_summable {a b : ℕ → ℝ}` with hypotheses `ha : Summable (fun n => abs (a n))` and `hb : Summable b` concludes: `Summable (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k))`.
This asserts that, for real sequences a, b, if the series of |a_n| is summable (absolute convergence of a) and the series of b_n is summable (convergent), then the Cauchy product sequence c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} is summable (i.e., the Cauchy product series converges). The use of `n - k` is with nat subtraction but since k ranges over `0..n`, it indeed means the usual `n - k`.

2) Compare with the natural language statement: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show the Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely.”
- Hypotheses match: a is absolutely summable, b is summable (convergent). The code’s domain is ℝ, which is a restriction compared to the unspecified scalar field in the NL statement, but that’s usually acceptable as a special case.
- Conclusion mismatch: The NL statement requires that the Cauchy product converges absolutely, i.e., the series of |c_n| is summable. The code only concludes `Summable c`, i.e., mere convergence of the Cauchy product, not absolute convergence. There is no `Summable (fun n => abs ( ... ))` in the conclusion.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The code proves (or states) only convergence of the Cauchy product, while the natural language statement asks for absolute convergence. This is a strictly stronger conclusion in the NL statement. Thus, the translation is not faithful. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only issue is the missing “absolutely” in the conclusion.

Therefore, the translation fails due to a critical difference in the conclusion.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem exists_compact_exhaustion_of_open (U : Set Complex) (hU : IsOpen U) :`
  Natural language: For an open set U in the complex plane, there exists ...
- `∃ K : ℕ → Set Complex,` There exists a sequence (indexed by ℕ) of subsets K_n of ℂ.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n)) ∧` Each K_n is compact.
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))) ∧` The sequence is nested strictly into the interiors: K_n ⊆ (K_{n+1})°.
- `(U = ⋃ n, interior (K n)) ∧` U equals the union of the interiors of the K_n.
- `(∀ n, ∃ m : ℕ, ∃ c : Fin m → Complex, ∃ r : Fin m → ℝ,` For each n, there exists a finite family indexed by `Fin m` of centers c_i ∈ ℂ and radii r_i ∈ ℝ.
- `K n ⊆ ⋃ i, Metric.closedBall (c i) (r i) ∧ (⋃ i, Metric.closedBall (c i) (r i)) ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))` Such that K_n is covered by finitely many closed balls (disks) and this finite union is contained in (K_{n+1})°.
This matches: for each n, there is a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊆ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊆ (K_{n+1})°.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original: U ⊂ ℂ open. There exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U such that K_n ⊂ K_{n+1}°; U = ⋃_{n=1}^∞ K_n°; and for each n, there exists a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊂ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊂ K_{n+1}°.

- Domain and context: Both are subsets of ℂ with U open. OK.
- Sequence K_n: Lean has K : ℕ → Set Complex. OK (indexing from 0 rather than 1 is immaterial).
- Compactness: Lean asserts IsCompact (K n). OK.
- Nested into interiors: Lean asserts K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)). OK (subset, not necessarily proper; the NL uses \subset, typically non-strict).
- Exhaustion by interiors: Lean asserts U = ⋃ n, interior (K n). OK (index shift irrelevant).
- Finite union of closed disks: Lean encodes a finite family via `Fin m` and uses `Metric.closedBall` in ℂ, which is exactly a closed disk. It asserts K n ⊆ ⋃ closedBall ⊆ interior (K (n+1)). OK.
- K_n ⊆ U: The NL demands K_n are subsets of U. The Lean statement does not state this explicitly, but it follows from the given properties: For each n, K n ⊆ ⋃ closedBall ⊆ interior (K (n+1)), and `interior (K (n+1)) ⊆ U` because U = ⋃ interiors implies every summand is contained in U. Hence K n ⊆ U for all n. So the ""subsets of U"" condition is indeed implied.
- Radii nonnegativity: `Metric.closedBall` allows any real radius; existence of a covering certainly permits choosing nonnegative radii, so this is not a mismatch.
- Ambient interior: Both use interior in ℂ (not relative interior), matching Mathlib's `interior` over `Complex`.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing from 0 vs from 1: harmless.
- Non-strict vs strict subset: The original uses \subset, typically meaning non-strict. Lean uses ⊆. OK.
- Explicit requirement K_n ⊆ U: Not stated, but implied as shown. No issue.
- Closed disks vs closed balls: Equivalent in ℂ.

All auxiliary components are legitimate Mathlib notions; there are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. The theorem statement faithfully matches the mathematical content of the original.

- The proof is `by sorry`, which is acceptable for the purposes of this audit if the statement itself faithfully matches the natural language.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language statement: “Suppose z0 ∈ ℂ. Show that lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z - z0| < δ.”

Issues:
1) Missing Riemann sphere notion: The code does not express “lim f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere”. In mathlib, that would be expressed via the one-point compactification (RiemannSphere or OnePoint ℂ) and a statement like Tendsto (fun z => (coe : ℂ → RiemannSphere) (f z)) (𝓝[≠] z0) (𝓝 ∞). The code instead speaks only about Tendsto of ‖f z‖ to atTop in ℝ.
2) Wrong filter (non-punctured): The standard and intended notion of limit as z → z0 requires a punctured neighborhood (exclude z0), which in mathlib is 𝓝[≠] z0 or requiring 0 < ‖z−z0‖ < δ. The code uses nhds z0 and the implication condition ‖z − z0‖ < δ (no 0 < ...), which includes z = z0. This makes the condition unrealistically strong and, in fact, impossible unless ‖f z0‖ is infinite. Thus, as stated, both sides of the code’s equivalence are generally false for ordinary ℂ → ℂ functions.
3) The right-hand side also lacks the exclusion 0 < ‖z − z0‖, which is standard in the epsilon–delta formulation for limits.
4) Even if one accepts that “lim in the Riemann sphere equals ∞” is equivalent to “‖f(z)‖ → ∞”, the code does not assert that equivalence; it only characterizes Tendsto (‖f z‖) (nhds z0) atTop with an epsilon–delta statement that is itself using the wrong (non-punctured) neighborhood.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
- No. The Lean statement is about Tendsto of the norm to atTop along nhds z0 (non-punctured), and the epsilon–delta part also includes z = z0. The natural language statement is about f tending to ∞ in the Riemann sphere sense, which corresponds to a punctured neighborhood and should be equivalent to ‖f(z)‖ → ∞ as z → z0 with z ≠ z0. The code omits the Riemann sphere and uses the wrong filter and condition. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- There are no vacuous definitions, but the core mathematical content is misformulated in two critical ways (wrong filter and missing Riemann sphere), making the result not faithful. Hence a low grade is appropriate.

- The natural language states: “Suppose L ∈ ℂ. Show that lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M.”
- The Lean formulation uses `Filter.cocompact (X := ℂ)` for the domain filter, which precisely captures “z → ∞” in the sense of the one-point compactification (Riemann sphere) for ℂ, and `nhds (L : ℂ)` for the usual neighborhood filter at L in ℂ. The right-hand side is exactly the ε–M condition. Using `>` instead of `≥` is immaterial due to the existential quantifier over M.

3) Final check for fidelity and potential red flags:
- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced. No placeholders redefining core concepts; it uses standard Mathlib filters (`Filter.cocompact`, `nhds`) and norms (`Complex.abs`).
- The meaning matches exactly: limit at infinity in the Riemann sphere sense is formalized by `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.cocompact _)`, and the ε–M bound is given in standard form.
- The target value L is in ℂ, as in the natural language statement. The domain’s “at infinity” is correctly modeled.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The Lean theorem abstracts the setting to an arbitrary type α and a function m satisfying two axioms that outer measures satisfy: monotonicity and (finite) subadditivity. An outer measure indeed has these properties, so the Lean hypotheses are sufficient and strictly more general.
- The domain R^n is generalized to an arbitrary α; this is a harmless generalization that preserves the original statement as a special case.
- The code does not explicitly use Mathlib’s `OuterMeasure` structure, but it captures exactly the properties needed for the result. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Mathematical content: Yes. The Lean statement asserts exactly the same equality under hypotheses satisfied by an outer measure; thus it implies the original statement and is logically faithful (in fact more general).
- Differences:
  - Generalization from R^n to any type α.
  - Assumptions are phrased as monotonicity and (finite) subadditivity rather than naming an `OuterMeasure`. Since every outer measure has these properties and nothing extra is required (m(∅)=0 is not needed here), this is fine.
  - No auxiliary definitions are introduced, and there are no vacuous placeholders.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful; minor stylistic deviation from explicitly using `OuterMeasure` and from R^n to general α is acceptable. Given the instruction to be extra harsh and prefer Mathlib terms, I note this slight mismatch but it does not affect correctness.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- `def RiemannIntegrableOn {X : Type*} (f : X → ℝ) (s : Set X) : Prop := True`: Defines a predicate named ""RiemannIntegrableOn f s"" for a function f on a set s, but sets it identically to True. This is a vacuous placeholder; it does not capture any real notion of Riemann integrability.
- Theorem `riemann_integrable_of_continuous_on`: For a metric space X, a subset S of X, and a function f : X → ℝ that is continuous on S, if S is totally bounded, then `RiemannIntegrableOn f S` holds. The proof is `by sorry`, i.e., omitted. Given the placeholder definition, this statement is trivially true regardless of the hypotheses.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: Let (X,d) be a metric space, S ⊂ X totally bounded, and f : S → ℝ continuous. Then f is Riemann integrable.
- Comparison of function types: The code takes f : X → ℝ with `ContinuousOn f S` rather than f : S → ℝ. These are essentially equivalent as formulations: a function defined on S is equivalent to a function on X restricted to S that is continuous on S.
- Core issue: The predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` is defined as `True`, so it does not represent Riemann integrability at all. This makes the theorem vacuous and not a faithful translation of the claim.
- Use of Mathlib: The code does not use any Mathlib notion of Riemann integrability. Mathlib mainly develops Riemann integrability for real-valued functions on intervals in ℝ (e.g., `RiemannIntegrable` on `[a,b]`) or measure-theoretic integrability (`Integrable`). The definition here is a placeholder and not aligned with existing Mathlib concepts.
- Auxiliary definitions: There is a single auxiliary definition, which is vacuous and not faithful to its intended meaning.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. Although the hypotheses on X, S, and f roughly mirror the natural language setup (modulo the domain of f), the integrability predicate is entirely vacuous. Thus the Lean statement does not assert the genuine mathematical content of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale
- The code uses a vacuous placeholder for the main concept, so it fails the faithfulness requirement. If the placeholder were replaced by a correct and fully specified notion of Riemann integrability on subsets of metric spaces and the theorem stated with that predicate, it would align with the natural language statement. Hence this fits the rubric of ""makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful.""

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in R^n modeled as the type `Fin n → ℝ`.
- Theorem `inverse_function_theorem_fin` takes:
  - `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)` and `hU : IsOpen U`: an open subset U of R^n.
  - `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)` and `hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U`: a function f that is C^1 on U.
  - `p : Fin n → ℝ` with `hp : p ∈ U`.
  - `h_deriv : ∃ (L : (Fin n → ℝ) ≃L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)), L.toContinuousLinearMap = fderivWithin ℝ f U p`: the derivative of f within U at p is equal (as a continuous linear map) to the underlying map of a continuous linear equivalence L, i.e., an invertible derivative at p (equivalently det ≠ 0 in finite dimensions). Since U is open and p ∈ U, this aligns with invertibility of the Frechet derivative at p.
- Conclusion: There exist open sets `V, W ⊆ (Fin n → ℝ)` with `IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W ∧ p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ f '' V = W ∧ Set.InjOn f V` and there exists a function `g` such that:
  - `∀ y ∈ W, f (g y) = y` (left inverse on W),
  - `∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x` (right inverse on V),
  - `ContDiffOn ℝ 1 g W` (g is C^1 on W).
Comment in the proof: it explicitly says they do not formalize the derivative identity `Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1}`; they only assert the existence and C^1-regularity of g.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL assumptions: U ⊆ R^n open; f: U → R^n continuously differentiable; p ∈ U; Df|_p invertible (det ≠ 0). The Lean assumptions match this: open U, f C^1 on U, p ∈ U, and the derivative at p is invertible (expressed as fderivWithin at p equals an invertible continuous linear equivalence; on open sets this is equivalent to invertibility of the Frechet derivative at p).
- NL conclusions: There exist open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, the restriction f|_V is injective, and hence a g: W → V exists with g = (f|_V)^{-1} on W. Furthermore, g is continuously differentiable and for all x ∈ V, y = f(x), one has Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1}.
- Lean conclusions: Existence of open V and W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f''V = W (i.e., f(V)=W), f is injective on V, and a function g with the two-sided inverse identities on V and W, and g is C^1 on W. From the identities one can infer that g maps W into V, so conceptually g: W → V. So far this aligns with the NL statement up to the codomain detail (which is derivable from the given properties).
- Crucial omission: The Lean theorem explicitly does not state the derivative identity Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1}. The NL statement asserts this as part of the theorem. The code has a comment acknowledging that this part is not formalized.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- The code faithfully captures the existence of local inverse neighborhoods V, W, injectivity of f|_V, and existence of a C^1 inverse g with the standard inverse identities on V and W.
- However, the NL statement includes the important additional conclusion that the derivative of g at y is the inverse of the derivative of f at x whenever y = f(x). The Lean code omits this equality entirely. This is a substantive part of the theorem, not a minor detail, and the comment admits this omission.
- Minor difference: the Lean g is typed as a function into the whole space rather than into V, but the given identities imply g(y) ∈ V for y ∈ W, so this is acceptable.

Conclusion: The translation is not fully faithful because it omits the derivative identity Dg = (Df)^{-1} on corresponding points. Everything else matches well.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem det_permutation_matrix_eq_one_or_neg_one {n : Type} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n] {R : Type} [CommRing R] (σ : Equiv.Perm n) :` sets up: for any finite index type n with decidable equality, any commutative ring R, and any permutation σ of n,
- `Matrix.det (fun i j => if j = σ i then (1 : R) else 0) = 1 ∨ Matrix.det (fun i j => if j = σ i then (1 : R) else 0) = -1` states that the determinant of the matrix whose (i,j)-entry is 1 if j = σ i and 0 otherwise is either 1 or -1.
- This matrix is exactly the standard permutation matrix associated to σ (one 1 in each row at column σ i and zeros elsewhere). No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “Let P be a permutation matrix. Prove that det(P) ∈ {−1, 1}.”
- The Lean statement constructs the canonical permutation matrix from an arbitrary σ and asserts its determinant is 1 or −1.
- Any permutation matrix (in the standard sense: exactly one 1 in each row and column, zeros elsewhere) corresponds to some σ with P_{i,j} = 1 iff j = σ i. Thus quantifying over σ covers all permutation matrices.
- Expressing “det ∈ {−1, 1}” as “det = 1 ∨ det = −1” is equivalent. This remains valid even in characteristic 2, where −1 = 1, since the disjunction still collapses to det = 1, which is exactly membership in that (possibly singleton) set.
- The base ring is any commutative ring R, which is a natural generality for determinants; the natural language didn’t specify a field, so this generality is acceptable and faithful.
- The instruction “without resorting to the Laplace formula” is about method of proof, not the statement; we only check the statement’s translation, and the theorem states the correct property.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code’s matrix matches the standard definition of a permutation matrix.
- The conclusion “det = 1 ∨ det = −1” matches “det ∈ {−1, 1}”.
- No extraneous or missing hypotheses relevant to the statement.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib; fine.
- `def IsJordanMeasurable {n : ℕ} (s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True`: Introduces a new predicate named ""IsJordanMeasurable"" for subsets of ℝ^n, but defines it to be always true. This is a vacuous placeholder and not a faithful definition of Jordan measurability. Red flag.
- `def Bounded {n : ℕ} (s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True`: Introduces a new predicate named ""Bounded"" for subsets of ℝ^n, also defined to be always true. This is a vacuous placeholder, not Mathlib's `Bornology.IsBounded` or `Set.Bounded`. Red flag.
- The theorem `bounded_convex_set_is_jordan_measurable ... (hb : Bounded s) (hcvx : Convex ℝ s) : IsJordanMeasurable s := by sorry` states: for any set `s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)` (interpretable as a subset of ℝ^n), if `s` is bounded (according to the placeholder `Bounded`) and convex (using the genuine `Convex ℝ s` from Mathlib), then `s` is Jordan measurable (according to the placeholder `IsJordanMeasurable`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation checking, but the predicates themselves are vacuous.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Every bounded convex set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable.""
- The Lean statement mirrors the structure: bounded + convex implies Jordan measurable. However, both key concepts—boundedness and Jordan measurability—are replaced by trivially true placeholders. This destroys the intended meaning; the theorem as written is effectively `True → True → True` and thus does not encode the mathematical content.
- Additionally, it does not use Mathlib's existing notion for boundedness (`Set.Bounded`/`Bornology.IsBounded`) and introduces a nonstandard, vacuous Jordan measurability predicate. This violates the guideline to use applicable Mathlib terms and flags the translation as unfaithful.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code does not capture the actual properties; it asserts a triviality instead of the intended measurable property. Even though the shape of the theorem matches, the core predicates are vacuous, so the mathematical meaning is not preserved.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous definitions are used. If replaced with legitimate definitions (e.g., `Set.Bounded` and a proper Jordan measurability predicate, if available/defined faithfully), the theorem statement would align with the natural language. Thus, per rubric, this fits: ""makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful"" → grade around 6.

- `import Mathlib` imports the full mathlib library.

  • Hypothesis h: for every n, U n is open and dense in X.
  • Conclusion: the intersection over all n of U n is dense in X.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: In a complete metric space, given a sequence {U_n}_{n=1}^∞ of open dense sets, the intersection ⋂_{n=1}^∞ U_n is dense.
- Lean statement: In a complete metric space, for a sequence U : ℕ → Set X with each U n open and dense, ⋂_{n∈ℕ} U n is dense.
- This is the standard formalization. The only superficial difference is indexing: the natural language uses n ≥ 1, while Lean uses all natural numbers. This is harmless: you can reindex by setting V n = U_{n+1}, so ⋂_{n∈ℕ} V n = ⋂_{n=1}^∞ U_n. Thus the Lean statement captures the same assertion.

3) Final check for differences or red flags:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts (MetricSpace, CompleteSpace, IsOpen, Dense) are standard mathlib notions.
- No misuse of placeholders besides the proof being omitted, which is acceptable per the instructions.
- The ℕ vs {1,2,...} indexing does not change the mathematical meaning, as explained via reindexing. The theorem indeed expresses the Baire category conclusion desired.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens: Using Mathlib with Complex and Finset notations.
- Theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_12552 (f : ℂ → ℂ): We consider a complex-valued function f on ℂ.
- Hypothesis h: ∃ U : Set ℂ, IsOpen U ∧ closedBall (0 : ℂ) 1 ⊆ U ∧ AnalyticOn ℂ f U. This says there exists an open set U containing the closed unit disk such that f is analytic (holomorphic) on U. This formalizes “f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk.”

  This exactly states: there exists a constant C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and all z with |z| ≤ 1, the absolute value |1 − Σ_{k=0}^m (f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0))) z^k| is bounded by C |z|^{m+1}. The sum over Finset.range (m+1) means k = 0,...,m. iteratedDeriv k f 0 denotes the k-th derivative at 0; dividing by (Nat.factorial k) cast to ℂ and then by f 0 matches f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0)); multiplying by z^k matches the term in the series. The absolute value is Complex.abs, and the RHS is C times |z|^(m+1).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The neighborhood condition is encoded as existence of an open U containing the closed unit ball with AnalyticOn ℂ f U. This is precisely “holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk,” since in complex analysis holomorphic ⇔ analytic, and AnalyticOn is a standard Mathlib notion.
- The nonvanishing condition f 0 ≠ 0 is correctly encoded.
- The quantified bound and its exact form (indices, coefficients, norms, and power of |z|) match the natural-language statement.
- The quantifiers are in the right order: there exists C such that for all m and all z with |z| ≤ 1, the inequality holds.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib terms (closedBall, AnalyticOn, iteratedDeriv, Nat.factorial, Complex.abs) are used appropriately.

3) Final check for differences:
- Using AnalyticOn instead of “holomorphic” is not a mismatch: for complex functions, holomorphic and analytic are equivalent, and the neighborhood condition is modeled exactly via an open U containing the closed disk.
- C is allowed to be any real in Lean; the original did not specify positivity, so this is fine.
- The function is globally defined f : ℂ → ℂ in Lean, but only analytic on the neighborhood U; this is a harmless modeling choice and does not alter the statement.
No substantive differences remain. The translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Let a : ℕ → ℝ be a real sequence. Assume the series ∑ a_n is summable (h_sum) but not absolutely summable (h_not_abs), i.e., it is conditionally convergent. Then for every ε > 0, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (n+1)^ε |a_{n+1}| diverges (i.e., is not summable). The index shift `n+1` is to avoid evaluating 0^ε.

2) Does this match the original natural language statement?
- Original statement: “Suppose ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent. Show that the terms a_n do not tend to zero ‘fast enough’ to ensure absolute convergence.” This is a qualitative/vague assertion: the decay of a_n is insufficient to make ∑ |a_n| converge. The minimal precise reading is simply “∑ |a_n| diverges,” which is already part of the definition of conditional convergence. A stronger, common precise strengthening is to assert that for any ε > 0, the weighted absolute series ∑ n^ε |a_n| diverges. The Lean theorem asserts exactly this stronger statement (with a harmless index shift).

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code formalizes a strictly stronger claim than what the vague natural language necessarily asserts. The NL statement does not specify any particular quantitative strengthening (like the n^ε weights); it only indicates that the terms do not go to zero fast enough to ensure absolute convergence, which is satisfied by the mere divergence of ∑ |a_n|. The Lean theorem says much more: for every ε > 0, ∑ (n+1)^ε |a_{n+1}| diverges. While this is a plausible and well-known strengthening in analysis, it is not logically equivalent to the given vague statement and goes beyond it. There are no vacuous placeholders; Mathlib notions (Summable, abs) are used properly, and no auxiliary fake definitions appear. The mismatch is in strength/precision: the code states a significantly stronger theorem than the NL text.

Therefore, the translation is not strictly faithful, though it is very close in spirit and gives a rigorous, stronger formulation.

- The theorem `bounded_uniformly_continuous_on_interval_integrable` states: Given real numbers a, b, and a function f : ℝ → ℝ, assuming (i) `a < b`, (ii) f is bounded on `[a,b]` (there exists M ≥ 0 such that for all x ∈ [a,b], |f x| ≤ M), and (iii) f is uniformly continuous on `[a,b]` (the ε-δ definition with x, y ∈ [a,b]), then `RiemannIntegrableOn f (Icc a b)` holds. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Suppose f : [a,b] → ℝ is bounded and uniformly continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable.”
- The hypotheses in the Lean theorem capture boundedness and uniform continuity on the closed interval [a,b] correctly via quantifiers restricted to `Icc a b`. They model f as ℝ → ℝ but only assume properties on the interval, which is a standard formalization.
- However, the target conclusion uses a placeholder predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` defined as `True`. This completely undermines the meaning of “Riemann integrable”; the statement becomes trivially true and does not faithfully assert Riemann integrability in Mathlib’s sense. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- There is also a secondary mismatch: the Lean theorem assumes `a < b`, excluding the degenerate interval case `a = b`, whereas the natural statement typically allows [a,b] (which might include a=b). This makes the Lean statement strictly weaker, though this issue is minor compared to the vacuous predicate.
- Additionally, the theorem concludes integrability “on Icc a b” rather than for a function whose domain is exactly [a,b]; this is a harmless formalization choice and would be fine if a proper integrability predicate were used.

Final check:
- Because `RiemannIntegrableOn` is defined as `True`, the key mathematical content is not represented. The translation is not faithful.
- Even if the predicate were fixed to a legitimate Mathlib notion of Riemann integrability, the result would then be essentially faithful (modulo the a<b vs a≤b point). As is, it fails.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous definition for the main concept → fails faithfulness.
- If fixed, the theorem statement would be essentially correct (up to the a<b restriction) → grade in the “6” range per the rubric.

",5,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: E is a real normed vector space (NormedAddCommGroup E, NormedSpace ℝ E). So this is more general than ℝ^n.
- Statement (theorem differentiable_on.lipschitz_on_of_bounded_fderiv):
  Given f : E → ℝ and a set s : Set E,
  hypotheses:
  • h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f s — f is (Frechet) differentiable within s at every point of s (i.e., has a within-derivative on s, not necessarily in an open neighborhood).
  • h_bound : ∃ C ≥ 0, ∀ x ∈ s, ‖fderiv ℝ f x‖ ≤ C — there exists a nonnegative bound C for the operator norm of the ambient derivative fderiv ℝ f x at each x ∈ s.
  • h_compact : IsCompact s — s is compact.
  conclusion: ∃ K : NNReal, LipschitzOnWith K f s — there is a Lipschitz constant on s.
  Proof is omitted by sorry.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be differentiable with ∇f continuous. Show that f is Lipschitz on compact subsets if ∇f is bounded on those subsets.
- Points of (mis)match:
  • Domain: The code works for any real normed vector space E, not specifically ℝ^n. This is stronger but acceptable if all other hypotheses align; it does not break faithfulness by itself.
  • Differentiability/Continuity of gradient: The natural statement assumes global differentiability and continuous gradient. The Lean statement does not assume continuity of the derivative (or gradient) at all; it only assumes DifferentiableOn on s and an explicit bound on the (ambient) derivative on s. So it omits the continuity requirement. While continuity of ∇f is not strictly needed if one assumes the explicit bound, the original statement contains that assumption—and the typical intended route uses continuity on compact sets to obtain boundedness automatically. Dropping that assumption makes the theorem strictly stronger than the natural statement as written, hence not a faithful translation.
  • Within vs ambient derivative: The code assumes DifferentiableOn ℝ f s (within differentiation), but the bound is stated using fderiv ℝ f x, which denotes the ambient derivative (DifferentiableAt), defaulting to 0 when f is not differentiableAt. On a non-open set s, DifferentiableOn does not imply DifferentiableAt, so the bound ‖fderiv ℝ f x‖ ≤ C may hold trivially (since fderiv is 0 by default) at points where f is not differentiableAt. This mismatch means the hypothesis in Lean does not accurately enforce “bounded gradient on s” in the intended sense. A faithful formalization should use the within derivative (fderivWithin) or assume DifferentiableAt on s or differentiation on an open neighborhood of s.
  • Geometric conditions: The usual Lipschitz conclusion from a derivative bound typically requires the bound on an open neighborhood of s or convexity of s, because the mean value inequality is applied along paths/segments that may leave s. The Lean statement only assumes bounded derivative on s (not a neighborhood) and no convexity/connectedness of s, which makes the claimed conclusion stronger than the standard result and likely false in this generality. The natural statement’s continuity of ∇f suggests one can extend the bound to a neighborhood of the compact set, but the Lean statement does not include such an assumption and so does not faithfully represent the intended mechanism.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  • Missing the “∇f continuous” assumption entirely.
  • Uses DifferentiableOn (within) but bounds the ambient derivative fderiv; potential vacuity at points where DifferentiableAt fails.
  • No requirement that the derivative bound holds on a neighborhood of s or that s is convex; likely overclaims compared to the standard result.
  • General E vs ℝ^n is fine, but coupled with the above issues, the meaning significantly diverges.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement. It both omits key assumptions and mismatches the derivative notion, making it a different (and implausibly stronger) claim.

  Natural language: Let f : ℂ → ℂ be complex-differentiable everywhere and injective. Then the choice-based inverse Function.invFun f is complex-differentiable on the subset Set.range f of ℂ, i.e., the image f(ℂ), in the sense of DifferentiableOn (within the set).

2) Compare to the original statement:
Original: Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic and injective. Show that f is a conformal mapping (holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse) onto its image.
- Hypotheses: ""analytic"" matches Lean's Differentiable ℂ f in this context (holomorphic on all of ℂ). Injective matches hfi.
- Desired conclusion: f is a holomorphic bijection onto its image with holomorphic inverse. This unpacks to: (i) f is bijective onto f(ℂ) (automatic from injective), (ii) the image f(ℂ) is an open subset of ℂ (since the inverse is holomorphic, its domain must be open), and (iii) the inverse g : f(ℂ) → ℂ is holomorphic (i.e., complex-differentiable in the open sense on its domain).

3) Does the Lean statement faithfully express this?
- The Lean conclusion is DifferentiableOn ℂ (Function.invFun f) (Set.range f). This asserts differentiability within the set, not differentiability in a neighborhood of each point. In Mathlib, DifferentiableOn is differentiable-within at each point of the set; this is strictly weaker than being holomorphic on an open set unless one also knows the set is open. The code does not assert that Set.range f is open.
- The NL statement says ""holomorphic inverse"" which (by standard usage) means holomorphic on an open domain. Thus, to be faithful, one should either (a) also assert IsOpen (Set.range f) and then claim DifferentiableOn on that open set (equivalently, holomorphic), or (b) state the inverse as a map from the open set f(ℂ) with the appropriate structure and assert Differentiable ℂ of that map.
- The code does not state the openness of the image, nor does it upgrade DifferentiableOn to the open-domain notion. It also does not explicitly state the bijection aspect (though injectivity implies bijection onto the image), but the primary mismatch is the difference between DifferentiableOn (within a possibly non-open set) and ""holomorphic inverse"".
- Additionally, the name/remark ""This expresses that f is conformal onto its image"" is not quite accurate: conformality (as biholomorphism onto the image) entails the image is open and the inverse is holomorphic in the open-domain sense, which is stronger than the DifferentiableWithinAt-on-a-set statement.

4) Final check/differences:
- Missing assertion that the image is open.
- Uses DifferentiableOn (within set) rather than holomorphic on an open set; this is weaker.
- Does not explicitly package the bijection onto the image (though that part is minor since injectivity implies it).
Therefore, the Lean statement is close but not a fully faithful translation; it asserts a weaker property than ""holomorphic inverse"".

/-- Suppose `f` is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and `f 0 ≠ 0`.
We express the analyticity assumption by giving the Taylor coefficients `a : ℕ → ℂ` and
assuming the power series ∑' a n z^n converges to `f z` for |z| ≤ 1.

Then there exists `C : ℝ` such that for all `m : ℕ` and `|z| ≤ 1` we have

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Context: We work over ℂ. The theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_12556 takes a function f : ℂ → ℂ and a sequence of complex coefficients a : ℕ → ℂ.
- Assumption h_series: For every z with |z| ≤ 1, the (pointwise) infinite sum ∑' n, a n * z^n equals f z. So on the closed unit disk, f coincides with the power series centered at 0 with coefficients a.
- Assumption h_a0: a 0 = f 0. (This is actually redundant given h_series at z = 0.)
- Assumption f0_ne: f 0 ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: There exists a real constant C such that for all m : ℕ and all z with |z| ≤ 1,
  |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (a k / f 0) z^k| ≤ C * |z|^(m+1).
  The finite sum is written with Finset.range (m+1) and the usual z^k.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Original hypothesis: f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk \overline{D}(0,1), i.e., there exists ε > 0 such that f is holomorphic on {z : |z| ≤ 1+ε}. Also f(0) ≠ 0.
- Code hypothesis: There exists a sequence a such that the power series ∑ a n z^n converges to f z for all |z| ≤ 1. This implies f is analytic on the open unit disk (and the a k agree with f^{(k)}(0)/k! by uniqueness), but it does not assert any analyticity beyond |z| < 1.
- Conclusion in NL: There exists C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and |z| ≤ 1,
  |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0))) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.
- Conclusion in code: Identical form with a k in place of f^{(k)}(0)/k!, which matches if a are indeed the Taylor coefficients at 0. Given h_series holds on the open unit disk, this is true. So the form of the inequality matches.

Step 3: Are the two statements the same?
- Key difference: The original requires f to be holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk (radius strictly larger than 1). The code assumes only that f equals a power series on the closed unit disk (hence holomorphic on the open unit disk), with no neighborhood-of-closure margin. This is strictly weaker than the original assumption. The theorem stated in Lean is therefore stronger than the original claim, and thus not a faithful translation.
- Secondary point: The code does not explicitly tie a k to f^{(k)}(0)/k!, but this follows from h_series on an open neighborhood of 0 (|z| < 1), so that part is acceptable. The extra premise h_a0 is redundant but harmless.
- Use of Mathlib notions: The code bypasses standard analytic/holomorphic predicates (e.g., AnalyticOn, HasFPowerSeriesOnBall with radius > 1) and encodes a weaker assumption via a pointwise series equality on |z| ≤ 1, which deviates from the intended hypothesis.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The hypothesis in Lean is weaker than in the natural language statement, so the Lean theorem claims more than the original theorem. Everything else matches reasonably, but this key mismatch means the translation fails.

  States that the convergence of s n x to limit x is not uniform on the open interval (-1, 1). The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is clear: uniform convergence fails on Ioo(-1,1).

2) Does this translate the natural language statement?
The natural language statement: For any c with 0 ≤ c < 1, show that the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on the closed interval [-c, c].
This asserts uniform convergence on each compact subinterval strictly inside (-1,1), parametrized by c.
The Lean theorem instead asserts the negation of uniform convergence on the larger set Ioo(-1,1). It does not mention c or the closed interval [-c,c], and it states a different (in fact opposite) property on a different domain.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: uniform convergence on [-c,c] for any 0 ≤ c < 1.
- Lean: non-uniform convergence on the entire open interval (-1,1).
These are different statements. Although both concern the geometric series and uniform convergence, the Lean code neither states nor implies the desired uniform convergence on [-c,c]. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; s and limit are correctly defined. But the final theorem contradicts the intended claim on a different set, so the translation is not faithful.

- Hypotheses:
  - ""Let X be a metric space"" corresponds to `[MetricSpace X]`.
  - ""such that every open cover of X has a finite subcover"" is precisely the definition of compactness and corresponds to `[CompactSpace X]` in Mathlib.

- The statement uses standard Mathlib notions (`CompactSpace`, `StrictMono`, `Filter.Tendsto`, `nhds`, `atTop`) and directly encodes the intended theorem.

  - `hU : Convex ℝ U` meaning U is convex.

  - `hK : IsCompact K` and `hKsub : K ⊆ U` meaning K is a compact subset of U.

  where `fderiv ℝ f x` is the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map) and `iteratedFDeriv ℝ 2 f x` is the second Fréchet derivative (a continuous bilinear/multilinear map), evaluated at the pair (y − x, y − x) via `fun _ => y - x`.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses: The NL statement requires f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U. In mathlib, `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` precisely captures f being C^2 on U, which already includes continuity of the second derivative (i.e., “H_f continuous”), so this matches or is even the standard formalization.
- Domain and sets: ℝ^n is represented as `(Fin n → ℝ)`; convex set U is present; K is a compact subset of U.
- Conclusion: The code asserts a uniform second-order Taylor estimate on K: for all ε > 0, there exists δ > 0, uniformly over all x,y ∈ K with ‖y − x‖ ≤ δ, the second-order remainder is bounded by ε‖y − x‖^2. This is exactly the meaning of “the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.”
- Use of derivatives: The terms `(fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x)` and `(iteratedFDeriv ℝ 2 f x) (fun _ => y - x)` represent the first and second order terms of the Taylor polynomial at x. The 1/2 factor is correctly included.

Potential subtleties checked:
- The NL statement does not explicitly say U is open; mathlib’s `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` is appropriate for a set U (not necessarily open), and the conclusion is a uniform estimate on K ⊆ U, matching the NL formulation. The presence of convexity mirrors the NL statement; it’s not used explicitly in the statement, but it’s standard in such results and does not harm faithfulness.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. All objects come from mathlib: `Convex`, `ContDiffOn`, `IsCompact`, `fderiv`, `iteratedFDeriv`.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement: same hypotheses (C^2 with continuous Hessian on convex U), same conclusion (uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets of U) with the standard ε-δ formulation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem analytic_local_inverse takes f : ℂ → ℂ and a point z0 : ℂ. It assumes:
  - h_der : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0 (complex differentiable at the point z0),
  - h_nz : deriv f z0 ≠ 0 (nonzero complex derivative at z0).
- It concludes that there exist open sets U, V ⊆ ℂ and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that:
  - z0 ∈ U and IsOpen U,
  - f z0 ∈ V and IsOpen V,
  - f '' U = V (the image of U under f is V),
  - ∀ w ∈ U, g (f w) = w (left-inverse property on U),
  - ∀ w ∈ V, f (g w) = w (right-inverse property on V),
  - DifferentiableAt ℂ g (f z0) (g is complex differentiable at the single point f z0).
- Note: From f '' U = V and the identity g (f w) = w for w ∈ U, it follows that g maps V into U, and the two inverse identities show that f|_U is bijective onto V with inverse g|_V.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement assumes f is analytic (holomorphic) and f'(z0) ≠ 0. “Analytic” standardly means holomorphic on a neighborhood of z0, not merely differentiable at a single point. The code only assumes DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0, which is strictly weaker than being holomorphic/analytic in a neighborhood. This is a mismatch in the hypothesis.
- The conclusion in NL: “f is a local diffeomorphism at z0 (that is, locally invertible with analytic inverse).” This entails that there exist open sets U, V with z0 ∈ U, f z0 ∈ V, such that f|_U: U → V is a bijection and both f and its inverse g are analytic (holomorphic) on U and V respectively. The Lean statement provides local invertibility on open neighborhoods, but it only asserts DifferentiableAt ℂ g (f z0), i.e., g is differentiable at one point, not that g is analytic on V (or even differentiable on a neighborhood). It also does not assert that f is analytic (or even differentiable) on all of U—only at z0 via the hypothesis. Thus the conclusion is significantly weaker than “analytic inverse.”
- So there are two major discrepancies: (i) hypothesis is too weak (pointwise differentiable vs analytic on a neighborhood), and (ii) conclusion is too weak (inverse differentiable at one point vs analytic on a neighborhood). 

3) Final check:
- The math problems are different. The Lean theorem does not faithfully encode “analytic” in the hypothesis or “analytic inverse” in the conclusion. It also fails to require differentiability/analyticity of f on the whole neighborhood U. Hence the translation is not faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library.
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: Fix a natural number n.
- `variable (m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Introduce an arbitrary function m_star from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as `Fin n → ℝ`) to real numbers. No properties are assumed about m_star.
- Docstring: Says m_star is the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles, and states subadditivity.
- `theorem outer_measure_via_rectangles_subadd (A B : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : m_star (A ∪ B) ≤ m_star A + m_star B := by sorry`: States that for the given (arbitrary) m_star and any sets A,B, we have m_star(A ∪ B) ≤ m_star(A) + m_star(B). The proof is omitted.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is about a specific object: m^* is the outer measure on ℝ^n constructed via coverings by countably many open rectangles. From that construction, prove subadditivity for any A, B.
- The Lean code does not encode that m_star is an outer measure, nor that it arises from coverings by open rectangles. It treats m_star as an arbitrary function `Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with no assumptions. This is a severe mismatch: the theorem asserts subadditivity for all such functions, which is far stronger than (and not implied by) the original statement. The docstring mentions the intended meaning, but the code does not incorporate it.
- No Mathlib structures are used (e.g., `OuterMeasure (Fin n → ℝ)`), and no mention or definition of open rectangles or countable coverings appears. This is a red flag per the guidelines.
- There are no auxiliary definitions that are vacuous placeholders like `:= True`, but the key property (being the rectangle-based outer measure) is entirely missing, making the statement unfaithful.

Final comparison:
- Original: For the specific outer measure m^* on ℝ^n defined via open rectangle coverings, show subadditivity.
- Lean: For an arbitrary function m_star on subsets of ℝ^n, assert subadditivity.
- These are different statements; the Lean statement is not a faithful translation. It lacks the essential hypotheses/definitions and overgeneralizes the conclusion.

Grade rationale:
- Related topic and inequality shape match, but crucial assumptions are missing and the theorem is stated far too generally. This warrants a low grade.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Context and variables:
  - a b : ℝ, U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U.
  - f : ℂ → ℂ.
  - α : ℝ → ℂ.
  - hα : DifferentiableOn ℝ α (Icc a b): α is C^1 on [a,b].
  - hα_range : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, α t ∈ U: the curve stays in U.
  - hα'_nonzero : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, deriv α t ≠ 0: α' never vanishes on [a,b].
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U: f is holomorphic on U (in Mathlib, DifferentiableOn ℂ means complex differentiable = holomorphic).
  - hderiv_nonzero : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, deriv f (α t) ≠ 0: the complex derivative of f is nonzero at all α(t).

- Statement:
  - (StrictMonoOn (Complex.arg ∘ f ∘ α) (Icc a b) ∨ StrictAntiOn (Complex.arg ∘ f ∘ α) (Icc a b))
    ↔ ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, Complex.arg (deriv f (α t) * deriv α t) = c.
  - In words: the principal argument of f ∘ α is strictly monotone or strictly antitone on [a,b] if and only if there is a real constant c such that the principal argument of the product deriv f(α(t)) · deriv α(t) equals c for all t ∈ [a,b].

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original statement:
- U ⊂ ℂ open.
- f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant.
- α : [a,b] → U smooth, with α'(t) ≠ 0 for all t.
- Conclusion: f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a,b] iff arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) is constant.

Agreements:
- U open, α maps [a,b] into U (represented via α : ℝ → ℂ with restriction to Icc a b and hα_range).
- f is holomorphic on U (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U).
- α is at least C^1 and α'(t) ≠ 0 on [a,b].
- The conclusion is an iff between strict monotonicity of the argument of f ∘ α and constancy of the argument of f'(α(t)) α'(t), encoded as an existential constant c.
- The disjunction StrictMonoOn ∨ StrictAntiOn matches “changes argument strictly monotonically.”

Key differences/problems:
1) Domain/type of f:
   - Original: f : U → ℂ.
   - Lean: f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This is a standard rephrasing and acceptable.

2) Nonconstant vs nonvanishing derivative along the path:
   - Original: f is nonconstant (global on U); no hypothesis that f'(α(t)) ≠ 0.
   - Lean adds a strictly stronger assumption hderiv_nonzero: ∀ t, deriv f (α t) ≠ 0. This is not stated in the original and materially strengthens the hypothesis.

3) Use of principal argument:
   - Lean uses Complex.arg everywhere, which is the principal argument (with a fixed branch and Complex.arg 0 = 0 by convention in Mathlib).
   - The natural language “argument” is usually multi-valued, and along a path typically refers to a continuous choice of argument; moreover, arg(0) is undefined in standard mathematics. The equivalence stated in mathematics often refers to a continuous argument along the path, not necessarily the principal branch. Using the principal arg can fail to capture monotonicity if the path crosses the branch cut, even when the continuous argument is monotone.
   - The Lean statement makes no assumption that f ∘ α avoids 0, yet still uses Complex.arg ∘ f ∘ α. In standard math, arg(f(α(t))) would be undefined at zeros. This is a mismatch in semantics.

4) Smoothness of α:
   - Original says “smooth curve” (likely C^∞), but the result needs only C^1. The Lean code only assumes DifferentiableOn (C^1). This is a weaker condition than stated, hence a difference. While not harmful for proving a stronger theorem, it is not a literal translation.

5) Missing explicit nonconstancy of f:
   - The original included “nonconstant.” The Lean code replaces it with hderiv_nonzero along the path and otherwise does not assume nonconstancy. This is not a faithful replacement of the original hypothesis.

6) Arg of derivative product at zero:
   - The Lean code enforces nonvanishing of both deriv f(α(t)) and deriv α(t), so the product is nonzero and its arg is well-defined in their sense. The original text did not add such an assumption, but it used arg of that product; in standard math arg(0) is undefined, so the original statement likely implicitly requires nonvanishing of that product. The Lean code makes this implicit requirement explicit but makes it strictly stronger by requiring deriv f ≠ 0 everywhere on the path (whereas the original only assumed f nonconstant).

Step 3: Final check — are they the same?
- No. The Lean statement strengthens the hypotheses by requiring deriv f(α(t)) ≠ 0 for all t, and it fixes the principal argument function, while the natural language statement is about the argument in the usual mathematical sense (typically a continuous choice along the path). It also omits the explicit “nonconstant” hypothesis on f, replacing it with a different, stronger condition. These are substantial differences, so the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- The code captures the general shape (open set, holomorphic, curve with nonvanishing derivative, monotonicity of argument iff constancy of arg of velocity), but introduces significant mismatches (principal arg vs continuous argument, extra strong assumption deriv f ≠ 0 along the path, omission of the nonconstant hypothesis, and smooth vs C^1). This is not a faithful translation, though it's thematically close.

  This states that the sequence of partial sums s_n does not converge uniformly to limit on the set Ioo (-1,1) = (-1,1).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: ""Show that the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k does not converge uniformly on (-1,1)."" Uniform convergence of a series is by definition uniform convergence of its partial sums. The code’s theorem is precisely the negation of the uniform convergence of s_n(x) to 1/(1 - x) on (-1,1). Since the series is known to converge pointwise to 1/(1 - x) on (-1,1), showing non-uniform convergence to that function is exactly the same as showing the series does not converge uniformly on that interval. The formalization uses the standard ε–N definition on the given domain. The auxiliary definitions s and limit are legitimate, not vacuous.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Domain: (-1,1) matches Ioo (-1) 1.
- Object: The series’ uniform convergence is expressed via partial sums s_n.
- Limit function: 1/(1-x) is the correct pointwise limit on (-1,1). Proving non-uniform convergence to this function matches the intended statement. No extraneous or missing components.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The environment: `import Mathlib` and `open scoped BigOperators` set up Mathlib and notation for sums and series (∑, ∑').
- The theorem quantifies over a type `α` with `[NormedField α]`, and sequences `a b : ℕ → α`.
- Hypotheses: `ha : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)` and `hb : Summable (fun n => ‖b n‖)` express that the series for `a` and `b` are absolutely summable (absolute convergence) since absolute convergence is defined as summability of the norms.
- Conclusion: A conjunction of two statements:
  1) `Summable (fun n => ‖Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))‖)`. The inner term `Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))` is exactly the nth Cauchy product coefficient `c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}`; taking the norm and asking `Summable` gives absolute convergence of the Cauchy product series.
  2) `(∑' n, Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))) = (∑' n, a n) * (∑' n, b n)`. This states that the sum of the Cauchy product series equals the product of the sums of the original series.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the only `sorry` is for the proof, which is permitted.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: ""The Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is absolutely convergent, and its sum equals the product of the sums."" The Lean code’s hypotheses express absolute convergence of both series, the first conclusion gives absolute convergence of the Cauchy product, and the second conclusion gives equality of the sum of the Cauchy product with the product of the sums. The definition of the nth Cauchy product term is standard (finite sum over k=0..n of a_k b_{n-k}), correctly encoded.

Potential differences or caveats:
- The code is stated for an arbitrary `NormedField α`, which includes the classical cases ℝ and ℂ and is a natural general context. This is not a mismatch; if anything, it is at least as general as the usual statement and aligns with the intended meaning.
- No other discrepancies found.

Final check: The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical meaning. No red flags (no placeholders, no vacuous definitions). The code uses appropriate Mathlib concepts (Summable, tsum, finite sums) correctly.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- import Mathlib, open Complex, noncomputable section: Setup for complex-analytic context.
- def f (z : Complex) : Complex := 1 / (z ^ 2 + 1) ^ 2: Defines the complex function f(z) = 1/(z^2+1)^2.
- def a (n : ℕ) : Complex := if n % 2 = 0 then (-1 : Complex) ^ (n / 2) * (Complex.ofReal (n / 2 + 1)) else 0: Defines coefficients a_n by case: if n is even, n=2k, set a_{2k} = (-1)^k (k+1); if n odd, a_n = 0. This matches the intended coefficients for the expansion of 1/(1+z^2)^2 around 0.

- theorem radius_of_convergence : True := by trivial: Asserts the proposition True, with a comment saying the radius is 1. This does not actually state anything about the radius of convergence; it is vacuous.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language asks: (i) Show f is analytic, (ii) find a power series for f at 0, and (iii) find its radius of convergence.
- The code defines f correctly as a complex function.
- The code provides a specific coefficient definition and a theorem stating the power series representation for |z|<1. That matches the expected expansion (∑_{n≥0} (-1)^n (n+1) z^{2n}) and corresponds to the power series at 0.
- The code never states that f is analytic (holomorphic) on a neighborhood of 0 or anywhere. While the power series equality would imply analyticity, the explicit claim “f is analytic” is not present.
- The radius of convergence is not stated. The only theorem related to the radius is `radius_of_convergence : True`, which is completely vacuous and does not encode “radius = 1”. The comment is not part of the formal content.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
Differences:
- Missing analytic statement: The NL statement explicitly asks to show f is analytic; the code does not include a theorem asserting analyticity (e.g., holomorphic on the unit disk or on C \ {±i}).
- Radius of convergence: The code fails to state the radius equals 1; instead it provides a trivial theorem `True`. This is a significant mismatch.
- Domain: The NL uses real variable x; the code works over Complex. This is acceptable (stronger), not a problem.
- The power series claim itself is correctly formulated for |z| < 1 with the intended coefficients, so that part matches.

Given the missing analytic statement and the vacuous, incorrect formalization of the radius of convergence, the translation is not faithful.

This matches the Cauchy product coefficients for the Maclaurin series of e^x cos x: coefficient of x^n is sum_{2j ≤ n} (-1)^j / ((n−2j)! (2j)!). So this is a legitimate, meaningful definition.
- def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := Real.exp x * Real.cos x: Defines f(x) = e^x cos x over the reals.
- theorem f_eq_power_series : ∀ x : ℝ, (∑' n : ℕ, a n * x ^ n) = f x := by sorry: States (without proof) that the infinite series with coefficients a(n) equals f(x) for all real x. This is a very strong statement: it asserts equality everywhere, not just near 0.
- theorem radius_of_convergence_infinite : True := by sorry: Declares a theorem with statement True. The docstring claims it is about infinite radius of convergence, but the actual statement is just True, so it conveys no mathematical content.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The natural language asks: prove f is analytic, find a power series for f at 0, and its radius of convergence.
- Power series at 0: The code gives explicit coefficients a(n) and claims the series equals f(x) for all x. This, if correct, provides the Maclaurin series and even more (global equality).
- Analyticity: The code does not state or use any notion of analyticity (e.g., RealAnalyticAt or AnalyticAt). While equality to a power series near 0 would imply analyticity, the code does not assert analyticity as a property.
- Radius of convergence: The second theorem is vacuous: it states True, not that the radius is infinite. This fails to encode the claimed content.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness
- The definition of a(n) is legitimate and corresponds to the intended Maclaurin coefficients. Good.
- The theorem f_eq_power_series, if it were proven, would imply both that the power series at 0 is as given and that the radius of convergence is at least the whole real line (i.e., infinite). However, the code does not formally assert analyticity, and more importantly, the separate theorem intended to state the radius of convergence is encoded as True, which is vacuous and does not represent the intended mathematical statement.
- By the strict guidelines, the presence of a vacuous theorem is a red flag and causes the translation to fail. Also, the absence of any explicit analyticity statement is a mismatch with the natural language requirement.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The series coefficients are correct and the main series-equality statement is on the right track, but the radius of convergence statement is vacuous and there is no explicit analyticity statement, so the translation fails.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def ConditionallyConvergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`
  Natural language: A real series (sequence) `a` is conditionally convergent if the series of its terms is summable (converges) and the series of its absolute values is not summable (diverges). This matches the standard definition of conditional convergence for real series.

- `theorem convergent_not_absolutely_convergent_conditional {a : ℕ → ℝ} : Summable a → ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|) → ConditionallyConvergent a := by ...`
  Natural language: If the series with terms `a n` is summable and the series with terms `|a n|` is not summable, then the series is conditionally convergent. The proof simply bundles the two hypotheses into the conjunction that defines `ConditionallyConvergent`.

Comparison with the original statement:
- Original: ""Show that if ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent.""
- Lean: exactly states that if `Summable a` and `¬ Summable (|a|)`, then `ConditionallyConvergent a` (which is defined as `Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable (|a|)`). This is a direct formalization of the statement.

Checks for potential issues:
- Domain and notions: Uses `ℝ` and Mathlib's `Summable` and absolute value `|·|`, which are standard. No placeholders or vacuous definitions.
- Indexing: The natural language uses sums from n=1 to ∞. Lean uses sequences indexed by `ℕ` (typically starting at 0). This is a harmless conventional difference; summability is invariant under finite shifts, so the mathematical meaning is the same.
- ""Diverges"" vs `¬ Summable`: For series of nonnegative terms `|a_n|`, divergence is equivalent to not being summable. The Lean statement matches this.

Final check: The formal statement is exactly the content of the natural language statement (it is essentially definitional). No discrepancies found.

- Hypothesis `hseq : ∀ s : ℕ → X, ∃ a : X, ∃ φ : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono φ ∧ Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 a)`: For every sequence `s : ℕ → X`, there exists a point `a : X` and a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` such that the subsequence `s ∘ φ` converges to `a` (in the topology of `X`, expressed as `Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 a)`). This is exactly the statement that every sequence in `X` has a convergent subsequence.
- Conclusion `IsCompact (univ : Set X)`: The entire space `X` is compact. In Mathlib, `IsCompact univ` means that every open cover of `X` has a finite subcover.
Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Let X be a metric space such that every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence. Prove that every open cover of X has a finite subcover."" This is the classical claim that in metric spaces, sequential compactness implies compactness.
- The Lean hypothesis precisely formalizes ""every sequence has a convergent subsequence"" using `StrictMono φ` and `Tendsto` to `𝓝 a` with `a : X`.
- The conclusion `IsCompact univ` is the standard Mathlib formalization of ""every open cover of X has a finite subcover.""
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib notions are used.
- No extraneous assumptions are added; no parts of the original statement are omitted.
Final check:
- The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same mathematically.
- No discrepancies found.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `variable {𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜]`: We work over a nontrivially normed field 𝕜 (e.g., ℝ or ℂ), standard in functional analysis.
- `variable {E F : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] [NormedAddCommGroup F] [NormedSpace 𝕜 F]`: E and F are normed vector spaces over 𝕜 (encoded as normed additive groups with a compatible 𝕜-vector space structure and norms).
- The theorem statement: `theorem linear_bounded_implies_continuous (A : E →ₗ[𝕜] F) (C : ℝ) (hC : 0 ≤ C) (h : ∀ x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖) : Continuous (A : E → F)` means: Given a linear map A from E to F, if there exists a real constant C ≥ 0 such that for all x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C · ‖x‖, then the function underlying A is continuous.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original NL statement: Let (X, ||·||_X) and (Y, ||·||_Y) be normed vector spaces. Show that if A ∈ L(X,Y) is linear and bounded, then A is continuous.
- Lean’s setting matches: E, F as normed vector spaces over a normed field 𝕜.
- A is a linear map in Lean: `A : E →ₗ[𝕜] F`.
- “Bounded” is expressed as existence of C ≥ 0 such that ∀ x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C ‖x‖: this is exactly `∃ C ≥ 0, ∀ x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖`, with C supplied as a parameter along with `hC` and `h`.
- Conclusion: A is continuous: `Continuous (A : E → F)`.
- Using ℝ for the bound C is standard since norms are ℝ-valued, even when 𝕜 is a general normed field.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The code’s theorem exactly formalizes: a linear map between normed vector spaces that is bounded by a constant (globally) is continuous. This matches the mathematical meaning of the NL statement.
- Minor notational ambiguity: In some texts L(X,Y) denotes bounded linear operators (hence already continuous), but the NL statement explicitly says “linear and bounded,” indicating the intended assumption is the boundedness inequality; the Lean code matches this interpretation precisely.
- The additional assumption that 𝕜 is a NontriviallyNormedField is standard and does not change the meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- noncomputable def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 1 / (1 + x ^ 2)
  This defines the function f: ℝ → ℝ by f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2), matching the natural language statement.

- theorem f_analytic_at_zero : ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ ∀ x : ℝ, |x| < r → f x = ∑' (n : ℕ), ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * x ^ (2 * n)
  This asserts: there exists a radius r > 0 such that for all real x with |x| < r, f(x) equals the (tsum) of the series Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n}. This is precisely a local power series representation of f around 0, i.e., analyticity at 0 (in the usual sense that a function equals its power series in some neighborhood).

- theorem series_convergence_radius_one :
  (∀ z : ℝ, |z| < 1 → Summable (fun n : ℕ => ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * z ^ (2 * n))) ∧
  (∀ z : ℝ, |z| > 1 → ¬Summable (fun n : ℕ => ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * z ^ (2 * n)))
  This states the series Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n} converges for |z| < 1 and does not converge for |z| > 1. That characterizes the radius of convergence as 1 (no claim is made about the boundary |z| = 1, which is standard since radius concerns strict inequalities).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The function f is defined exactly as in the statement.
- The first theorem provides a power series expansion at 0 and thus shows analyticity at 0 (the typical meaning of being analytic at a point). While it does not use Mathlib's AnalyticAt predicate, it states the defining property directly (existence of r > 0 and equality to a power series on |x| < r), which is faithful.
- The second theorem determines the radius of convergence of that series to be 1 by giving the precise convergence/divergence criteria inside/outside the unit interval.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- Potential ambiguity: The phrase ""Show that f is analytic"" could be interpreted as global real-analytic on ℝ, whereas the code only states analyticity at 0. However, given the immediate follow-up to ""find a power series for f at 0 and its radius of convergence,"" it is natural that the intended claim is analyticity at 0 with its Maclaurin series and radius. The provided code fully captures that.
- No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions; f is defined concretely, and the theorems (though with sorry proofs) assert the correct mathematical statements.
- Mathlib concepts are used in a standard way (Summable, ∑'), even if not using AnalyticAt explicitly; the content remains faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful. The only slight mismatch is the global-vs-local reading of ""analytic,"" but in context this is acceptable.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `def IsConditionallyConvergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`
  This defines, for a real sequence a, the property that its series is conditionally convergent as: the series of a is summable (i.e., converges) and the series of its absolute values is not summable (i.e., does not converge absolutely).

- `theorem conditional_convergence_of_convergent_not_abs {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h1 : Summable a) (h2 : ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|) : IsConditionallyConvergent a := by sorry`
  This states: for a real sequence a, if the series sum of a converges and the series sum of |a| does not (i.e., is not summable), then the series is conditionally convergent (as defined above).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: Suppose ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges. Show that the series is conditionally convergent.
- ""∑ a_n converges"" corresponds to `Summable a`.
- ""∑ |a_n| diverges"" corresponds to `¬ Summable fun n => |a n|` in ℝ.
- ""the series is conditionally convergent"" corresponds to `IsConditionallyConvergent a` defined as convergent but not absolutely convergent.
The code matches exactly, with the standard Mathlib predicate Summable and the usual absolute value on ℝ. No placeholder or vacuous definitions are used; the auxiliary definition faithfully matches the standard meaning of conditional convergence.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
- The only specialization is to real series (ℝ), which is a standard context for the given statement and does not change the meaning.
- The logical structure and terms correspond precisely.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- def rectangle (n) (a b) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := fun x => ∀ i, a i ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ b i: Defines an axis-aligned closed rectangle in ℝ^n as the set of points x with coordinates between a and b componentwise.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The NL statement is: Let m^* denote the outer measure on ℝ^n (defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles). Show that if R is a closed rectangle, then m^*(R) = V(R).

Key requirements from the NL statement:
- m^* is specifically the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles (a very specific construction with properties: monotone, countably subadditive, agrees with volume on rectangles, etc.).
- R is a closed rectangle.
- Conclusion: m^*(R) equals its volume V(R).

What the Lean theorem states instead:
- It introduces an arbitrary function m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ with no properties. There is no link to outer measure, no axioms (monotonicity, countable subadditivity), and no connection to the construction via open rectangles.
- It then asserts m_star(rectangle n a b) = volume n a b for all such m_star. That is far stronger than the NL claim and is simply not the same statement.
- The rectangle and volume definitions are plausible models for a closed rectangle and its volume. However, the crucial part—the specific outer measure m^* and its definition—is completely missing.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- The major mismatch: the code does not specify m_star is the outer measure defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles; it treats m_star as an arbitrary function. Thus the theorem statement is not faithful to the NL statement.
- No Mathlib outer measure or measure-theoretic concepts are used; no reference to MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure, Lebesgue measure, or content/volume, which is a red flag per the instructions.
- The auxiliary definitions rectangle and volume are legitimate (not vacuous), but the central object m_star is not defined at all, making the theorem’s statement unfaithful.

Conclusion: The translation fails. It does not encode the essential hypothesis that m^* is the specific outer measure on ℝ^n defined via countable open-rectangle coverings. The theorem as stated claims equality for an arbitrary m_star, which is not the same problem.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `E` is a type with a normed additive commutative group structure and is complete (`[CompleteSpace E]`). This supports absolute convergence and existence of sums (`tsum`).
- Statement: Given a sequence `a : ℕ → E` and a function `N : ℕ → ℕ`, assume:
  - `h_abs : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)`: the series of norms converges (absolute convergence of ∑ aₙ).
  - `hN0 : N 0 = 0`: grouping starts at index 0.
  - `hNmono : StrictMono N`: N is strictly increasing, so blocks are consecutive and nonempty.
  - `hN_unbounded : ∀ m, ∃ k, N k ≥ m`: N tends to infinity (redundant given strict monotonicity on ℕ with N 0 = 0, but harmless).
- Grouped series: `fun k => Finset.sum (Finset.range (N (k+1) - N k)) (fun i => a (N k + i))` means the k-th term is the finite sum of the block of consecutive terms from index `N k` up to `N (k+1) - 1`.
- Conclusion: The grouped series is summable and its sum equals the sum of the original series: `Summable (...) ∧ tsum (...) = tsum a`.

Faithfulness check against the NL statement:
- NL: If ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, then any series obtained by grouping terms also converges and has the same sum.
- Lean: Exactly formalizes grouping as sums over consecutive finite blocks determined by a strictly increasing, unbounded `N` with `N 0 = 0`, and proves the grouped series is summable with the same sum. The use of `tsum` captures ""has the same sum"". The ambient generality (any complete normed abelian group) is a standard generalization and does not change the mathematical meaning.
- Indexing: NL starts at n = 1, Lean at n = 0; this is a harmless reindexing and does not change the content.
- Extra hypothesis `hN_unbounded` is redundant given `StrictMono N` and `N 0 = 0` (indeed `N k ≥ k`), so it does not restrict the class of groupings. Thus the statement still covers ""any grouping"" in the intended sense.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are standard Mathlib (`Summable`, `tsum`, `StrictMono`, `Finset.sum`).

Final comparison: The Lean theorem faithfully captures the NL claim: absolute convergence implies any grouping of consecutive terms converges to the same sum. The minor indexing shift and redundant unboundedness hypothesis do not affect faithfulness.

  (h) for every subsequence index map φ : ℕ → ℕ that is strictly increasing (StrictMono φ), for every L ∈ ℝ, if the subsequence x ∘ φ tends to L (Filter.Tendsto (x ∘ φ) atTop (nhds L)), then L = ℓ (i.e., every convergent subsequence has limit ℓ),
  then the whole sequence x tends to ℓ (Filter.Tendsto x atTop (nhds ℓ)).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The hypothesis hbound precisely matches “{x_n} is bounded.”
- The hypothesis h formalizes “every convergent subsequence has the same limit ℓ”: it quantifies over all subsequences (via StrictMono φ), and asserts that if a subsequence converges to some L, then L must equal ℓ.
- The conclusion is exactly “x_n → ℓ.”
- The setting is explicitly for real sequences (ℝ). The natural language statement did not explicitly specify the ambient space, but in standard analysis contexts this is typically ℝ. Using ℝ is a reasonable and faithful specialization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only specialization is to ℝ. The natural language statement is commonly about real sequences; in any case, specializing to ℝ does not distort the meaning of the claim. All logical structure matches exactly: boundedness + uniqueness of subsequential limits among convergent subsequences implies convergence to ℓ.
- No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions relative to the intended statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- NL statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ, C^2 with H_f continuous on a convex set U. Show that the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- The code captures: finite-dimensional ℝ-vector space (ok), compact K ⊆ U (ok), convex U (ok), and a uniform-in-x remainder estimate of size O(‖h‖^2) with a δ independent of x (ok in spirit). The expression used for the quadratic term is the Hessian applied to (h, h) with 1/2 factor (ok in spirit).

Step 3: Critical faithfulness checks and issues.
- Major issue: the code uses ambient derivatives fderiv ℝ f x and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x. But the hypothesis is only ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, i.e., differentiability and continuity of derivatives within the set U, not necessarily in any open neighborhood of x in E. In Mathlib, fderiv is the unrestricted (ambient) derivative at x; if f is only ContDiffOn on U (and potentially arbitrary outside U), fderiv at x need not agree with the within derivative and might not even exist in the intended sense; Mathlib defines fderiv to return 0 when not differentiableAt. Thus the polynomial part in the code is potentially using the wrong derivative objects. The correct formulation for a set U that may not be open is in terms of fderivWithin and the iterated within derivative (or iteratedFDerivWithin). This is a substantive mismatch.
- Related: The NL statement does not explicitly say U is open; the code does not assume U is open either, which is fine. However, for non-open U, using ambient derivatives is especially problematic, and the Lean statement should quantify in terms of the within derivatives. This is the central fidelity failure.
- The code requires the side condition x + h ∈ U. This is reasonable and matches the usual condition that the segment [x, x+h] stays in U to justify Taylor’s theorem, especially given convexity of U (segment inclusion follows from x, x+h ∈ U). Some formulations would instead assume U open and K ⊆ interior(U) so that for small ‖h‖ this is automatic; the code’s explicit guard is acceptable in spirit.
- Assumptions: The code assumes ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (full C^2 on U) rather than merely “H_f continuous on U.” This is stronger than necessary but compatible, not a fatal mismatch by itself.

Conclusion: Because the statement uses ambient derivatives instead of within-set derivatives under only a ContDiffOn-on-U hypothesis, it is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (which concerns differentiability on U). This is a substantial technical discrepancy that can change the meaning: the left-hand side polynomial terms may not reflect the derivatives available on U, and the result as stated could be false if f is rough outside U. To be faithful, the theorem must use fderivWithin and the second within derivative (e.g., iteratedFDerivWithin) at x, or else assume f is C^2 on an open neighborhood of K (so ambient and within derivatives coincide).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code to natural language:
- Context: We work with real sequences a, b : ℕ → ℝ.
- Hypotheses: ha : Summable (fun n => |a n|) means the series ∑ |a_n| converges (absolute convergence of ∑ a_n over ℝ). hb : Summable b means the series ∑ b_n converges.
- Definition of c_n: The sequence whose n-th term is Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k)), i.e., c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} (since range (n+1) = {0, 1, ..., n}).
- Conclusion: The pair of statements
  • Summable (fun n => ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}) — that is, the Cauchy product series ∑ c_n converges.
  • (∑' n, ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}) = (∑' n, a n) * (∑' n, b n) — that is, the sum of the Cauchy product equals the product of the sums of a and b.
Here ∑' denotes the infinite sum (tsum) in Mathlib.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges, then c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} defines a convergent series and its sum equals the product of the sums.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: it assumes absolute convergence of a (via Summable |a n|) and convergence of b; it defines c_n as the Cauchy product term; it concludes the series ∑ c_n converges and that its sum equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- Indexing and bounds match: k ranges from 0 to n inclusive, implemented as range (n+1). The use of b (n - k) corresponds to b_{n-k} for k ≤ n.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only specialization is to ℝ (reals), which is a standard setting for the statement and does not change its mathematical meaning given the original statement did not specify a more general space. All terms used (Summable, tsum, Finset.sum) are standard Mathlib notions.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- import Mathlib: Brings in mathlib; fine.
- variable {n k : Nat}: Introduces two natural numbers: n (dimension) and k (number of rectangles). This matches the intent to work in R^n with k rectangles.
- variable (mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ): Declares mstar as an arbitrary set function on subsets of R^n (modeled as Fin n → ℝ). There is no structure or assumption that mstar is an outer measure.
- def IsOpenRectangle (s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True: Placeholder predicate for “open rectangle,” but it is vacuous (always True). This does not capture the intended notion.
- theorem mstar_union_disjoint_open_rectangles ... : mstar (⋃ i : Fin k, R i) = Finset.univ.sum (fun i => mstar (R i)) := by sorry: States that for any family R : Fin k → Set (Fin n → ℝ), if the R i are pairwise disjoint (h_disjoint) and satisfy h_open (which is vacuous), then the equality holds for the given mstar. This asserts finite additivity for any arbitrary set function mstar, with no outer measure properties assumed. The conclusion is far stronger than the natural language statement and lacks essential hypotheses.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- Original: “Let m* be the outer measure on R^n. Suppose R_1,...,R_n are pairwise disjoint open rectangles. Prove m*(⋃ R_k) = ∑ m*(R_k).” This presupposes that m* is (Lebesgue) outer measure on R^n and the sets are open rectangles (a specific geometric/measurable class). The disjointness is assumed; finiteness is used.
- Code: Does not assume mstar is an outer measure at all; it is any function Set → ℝ. The “open rectangle” condition is a vacuous True, so the theorem does not genuinely assume anything about openness/rectangles. Thus the statement in Lean is not a faithful restatement of the original; it is strictly stronger (and in fact false in general) because it claims additivity for arbitrary mstar on arbitrary disjoint families.

3) Final check — differences:
- Missing outer measure assumption: The code never requires mstar to satisfy the outer measure axioms or even be an outer measure.
- Vacuous open rectangle predicate: IsOpenRectangle := True makes the “open rectangle” hypothesis meaningless.
- Scope: The code asserts the equality for any set function mstar and any pairwise disjoint sets, not specifically for open rectangles under an outer measure. This is a major mismatch.
- Indexing: The code uses k rectangles (Fin k), which is fine in spirit compared to R_1,...,R_n in the statement; no issue here.

Auxiliary definitions: The only auxiliary definition (IsOpenRectangle) is vacuous, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is not a faithful translation. It omits crucial hypotheses and uses a vacuous placeholder, leading to a fundamentally different (and overly strong) claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language says ""attains a maximum at x0 ∈ int(K)"" which is captured by hmax (global maximum on K) and hx0 (x0 ∈ interior K). Since interior K ⊆ K, x0 ∈ K holds. No extra or missing conditions. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. All notions use standard Mathlib definitions.
- Any additional strength? The assumptions are exactly those in the natural language. The conclusion is precisely Df(x0)=0, expressed as the zero Fréchet derivative.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- `/-- The derivative operator on polynomials over ℝ is a linear map. -/` is just a docstring comment; it has no logical force.
- `def D : Polynomial ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] Polynomial ℝ := by sorry` attempts to define a specific ℝ-linear map from polynomials over ℝ to polynomials over ℝ, but provides no actual definition (uses `sorry`). Crucially, it does not specify that the underlying function of this linear map is the derivative. As written, it merely asserts the existence of some linear map, with no relation to differentiation.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines D to be the derivative operator on ℝ[t] and asks to show that this D is linear. To capture this faithfully in Lean, one must either define `D` to be the derivative (e.g. `Polynomial.derivativeLinearMap ℝ`) or prove a theorem that the derivative function is linear.
- The provided code neither ties `D` to the derivative nor avoids placeholders. It uses `sorry` (a vacuous placeholder), violating the guideline against vacuous definitions, and it does not encode that `D` is the derivative operator.
- Therefore, the code does not faithfully translate the statement. Even if it compiles, it fails to assert that the map is the derivative, and the placeholder makes it vacuous.

Final check:
- Original statement: “Let D be the derivative operator; show D is linear.”
- Lean code: “Define some linear map D : ℝ[x] →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ[x] (with no definition provided).” These are different: the Lean code neither defines D as the derivative nor proves linearity of the derivative.

Because the issue is a vacuous placeholder and the core identification of D with the derivative is missing, the translation fails. If the `sorry` were replaced with the actual derivative linear map (e.g., `Polynomial.derivativeLinearMap ℝ`), it would then be faithful. Hence the appropriate grade is 6 per the rubric.

  Natural language: Let a be a real sequence indexed by ℕ, and let σ : ℕ → ℕ be a bijection (a rearrangement of the indices). If the series of absolute values ∑ |a n| is summable (absolute convergence), then the infinite sum (tsum) of a equals the infinite sum of the rearranged sequence a ∘ σ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show that for any rearrangement of the series, the sum remains the same.”
- The Lean statement assumes absolute summability `Summable (fun n => |a n|)` (over ℝ), and for any bijection σ on ℕ (a rearrangement), it asserts equality of sums via `tsum`. This precisely captures “the sum remains the same” under rearrangement when the series is absolutely convergent.
- Using `tsum` is standard in Mathlib for the sum of an infinite series; under `Summable`, `tsum` coincides with the usual sum. The bijectivity of σ is exactly the structure of a rearrangement.

3) Final check and differences:
- Indexing: The natural language uses n = 1 to ∞, while the Lean code uses ℕ (starting at 0). This is a harmless indexing convention difference; the mathematical content is unchanged.
- Domain: The code specializes to ℝ; the natural statement is typically about real (or complex) series. Specialization is acceptable.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The code sets up a very general context: E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space with the usual measure/topology structure (MeasurableSpace, MeasureSpace, BorelSpace, SecondCountableTopology). It considers a function f : E → ℝ and a set U ⊆ E.
- Hypothesis hU : Convex ℝ U says U is convex.
- Hypothesis (L : NNReal) (hL : LipschitzOnWith L f U) says f is L-Lipschitz on the set U.
- Conclusion: ∀ᵐ x ∂volume, x ∈ U → DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f U x. This reads: for volume-almost every x in E, if x lies in U then f is differentiable within U at x. Equivalently, for (volume.restrict U)-almost every x, f is differentiable within U at x.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- NL statement (literal reading): “Suppose f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable and Lipschitz on a convex set U. Show that f is differentiable almost everywhere on U (Rademacher’s theorem in this context).”
- Issues/mismatches:
  1) Assumptions: The NL statement includes “differentiable and Lipschitz on U” as assumptions. The code only assumes Lipschitz on U and does not carry an assumption that f is differentiable on U. Dropping an assumption (even if redundant) is a mismatch with a strict translation.
  2) Domain: The NL uses ℝ^n; the code works in any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E. This generalization is acceptable as a faithful strengthening of the original setting.
  3) Conclusion notion: The NL phrase “differentiable almost everywhere on U” standardly means Fréchet differentiable at almost every x ∈ U (i.e., DifferentiableAt ℝ f x for a.e. x in U with respect to Lebesgue measure restricted to U). The code states DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f U x a.e. on U, which is weaker than DifferentiableAt on boundary points. However, because U is convex in ℝ^n (or in finite-dimensional E) the boundary of U has Lebesgue measure zero; hence, a.e. on U lies in the interior where DifferentiableWithinAt equals DifferentiableAt. So, up to measure-zero sets, the within/at distinction disappears in this context. Nevertheless, as a strict translation, using DifferentiableWithinAt is not literally the same as DifferentiableAt, so there is a mismatch in phrasing.
  4) Measure formulation: The code’s ∀ᵐ x ∂volume, x ∈ U → ... is equivalent to “for volume.restrict U-a.e. x, ...” which matches the intended “a.e. on U (Lebesgue/volume).” This part is fine.

Step 3: Final check—are they the same?
- The code captures a version of Rademacher’s theorem: Lipschitz on a convex set implies (within-)differentiability a.e. on that set, measured by Lebesgue measure. Up to standard measure-theoretic facts about convex sets (boundary has measure zero), this matches the intended mathematical content of “differentiable a.e. on U.”
- However, strictly:
  - The NL assumptions included an extra “differentiable on U” that the code omits.
  - The code concludes DifferentiableWithinAt rather than DifferentiableAt. While these are a.e. equivalent under convexity in finite-dimensional spaces, they are not literally the same assertion.

Verdict: Not a perfectly faithful translation under the extra-harsh standard. It is very close mathematically and would be accepted in practice, but it differs on assumptions and on the exact differentiability notion in the conclusion.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem considers a real sequence x : ℕ → ℝ and a real number l. The hypothesis h is the ε–N definition that x_n → l: for every ε > 0 there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, |x n − l| < ε.
- The conclusion is a conjunction of two facts:
  • For every ε > 0 there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, |min (x n) 0 − min l 0| < ε. This states that the sequence y_n := min(x_n, 0) converges to min(l, 0).
  • min l 0 ≤ 0. This is a simple inequality about the value min(l, 0).
- The docstring explicitly paraphrases: if x_n → l and y_n = min(x_n, 0), then y_n → min(l, 0) and in particular the limit is ≤ 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let {x_n} be convergent and y_n = min{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≤ 0.
- The Lean statement assumes x_n converges to some l (standard formalization of ""x_n is convergent""). It then concludes two things: (i) y_n converges to min(l, 0), and (ii) min(l, 0) ≤ 0. From these, it follows that lim y_n = min(l, 0) ≤ 0, which is exactly the requested inequality.
- Thus the Lean theorem proves a stronger result (it identifies the limit of y_n explicitly), which implies the desired conclusion.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The Lean code addresses the same mathematical situation: a convergent real sequence {x_n} and y_n = min(x_n, 0).
- It proves that y_n converges to min(l, 0) and hence that lim y_n ≤ 0. The original statement only asked for the inequality lim y_n ≤ 0. The Lean statement is stronger but implies the original. There are no vacuous placeholders or auxiliary fake definitions; it uses a standard ε–N convergence form.
- Minor difference: the Lean formulation is stronger than required. Under the ""extra harsh"" guideline, that is the only deviation from exact matching, but it is still a faithful translation that captures and strengthens the intended claim.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code.
- `variable {K : Type _} [Field K]` sets up a field K, matching the usual setting for determinants and linear (in)dependence.
- `variable {n : Nat} {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K}` declares A to be an n-by-n matrix over K.
- `lemma det_eq_zero_implies_cols_linear_dependent (h : Matrix.det A = 0) : ∃ c : Fin n → K, c ≠ 0 ∧ A.mulVec c = 0` states: if det(A) = 0, then there exists a nonzero vector c of coefficients such that A * c = 0. Interpreting A.mulVec c = 0 as the linear combination of columns of A with coefficients c equals the zero vector (and c ≠ 0), this is exactly “the columns of A are linearly dependent.”
- `lemma det_ne_zero_implies_cols_linear_independent (h : Matrix.det A ≠ 0) : ∀ c : Fin n → K, A.mulVec c = 0 → c = 0` states: if det(A) ≠ 0, then the only solution to A * c = 0 is c = 0. This is exactly the definition that the columns of A are linearly independent.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The first part (“Suppose det(A) = 0. Prove that the columns (or rows) of A are linearly dependent.”) is captured by the first lemma: existence of a nontrivial c with A.mulVec c = 0 is precisely a nontrivial linear relation among columns.
- The second part (“if det(A) ≠ 0 prove that the columns (or rows) of A are linearly independent.”) is captured by the second lemma: uniqueness of the trivial solution to A.mulVec c = 0 is exactly linear independence of columns.
- The code chooses the columns version; the statement says “columns (or rows),” which allows either viewpoint. Proving columns is faithful to the problem’s request.

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no placeholders; only lemma statements, which is acceptable.
- Use of mulVec correctly represents linear combinations of columns: (A.mulVec c) i = ∑ j A i j * c j, i.e., sum of columns weighted by c equals zero.
- Over a field, the determinant criterion matches the invertibility/kernel statements used here.
- Not using Laplace formula is a proof-method restriction; the code only states the theorems, which is fine for translation.
- Rows are not explicitly mentioned in the code, but the problem’s phrasing “(or rows)” permits focusing on columns.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful formalization of the natural language statements.

    - hd : Differentiable ℂ f, i.e., f is complex-differentiable at every point of ℂ (entire).
    - hf : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0, i.e., f is nowhere zero.
  • Conclusion: There exists g : ℂ → ℂ such that g is complex-differentiable everywhere (holomorphic on ℂ) and f = exp ∘ g (pointwise equality of functions), i.e., f(z) = Complex.exp (g z) for all z.
  • The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for auditing translation fidelity.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language: Let f be entire and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show that there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.
- ""Entire"" is captured by Differentiable ℂ f (global complex differentiability).
- ""f(z) ≠ 0 for all z"" is hf : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0.
- ""there exists a holomorphic g"" is ∃ g, Differentiable ℂ g.
- ""with f = e^g"" is f = exp ∘ g.
This matches exactly the mathematical content.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence
- Domain and codomain are ℂ → ℂ.
- Holomorphic is represented by Differentiable ℂ.
- The exponential is exp on ℂ, i.e., Complex.exp, inferred by type.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No missing hypotheses (ℂ is simply connected; the code does not need to state this explicitly).
Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- `theorem jirilebl_reverse_triangle_real (x y : Real) : abs (abs x - abs y) ≤ abs (x - y) := by sorry` states: for any real numbers x and y, the absolute value of the difference of their absolute values is less than or equal to the absolute value of their difference.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: For all x, y in R, | |x| - |y| | ≤ |x - y| (reverse triangle inequality). The Lean statement precisely captures this: universally quantified x, y : Real, with the exact inequality.
- Symbols and functions (Real, abs, subtraction) are standard Mathlib notions. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same. There are no discrepancies in quantifiers, domains, or the inequality expressed. Using |x − y| instead of |y − x| is identical. Everything matches.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def f (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x / (1 + ((n : ℝ) * x) ^ 2)`: This defines f_n(x) = x / (1 + (n·x)^2), matching the natural-language f_n.
- `def g (a : ℕ → ℚ) (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ := (Finset.range n).sum (fun k => (1 : ℝ) / (2 ^ (k + 1) : ℝ) * f n (x - (a (k + 1) : ℝ)))`: This defines g_n(x) as a finite sum over k = 0,...,n-1 of 1/(2^(k+1)) times f_n(x - a_{k+1}). Reindexing j = k+1, this is exactly ∑_{j=1}^n 2^{-j} f_n(x - a_j), with the rationals a_j cast to ℝ as needed. This matches the natural-language definition of g_n.
- `theorem g_tends_to_zero_uniform (a : ℕ → ℚ) : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : ℝ, |g a n x| < ε := by sorry`: This states that the sequence (g_n) converges uniformly to 0 on ℝ, expressed as the usual ε–N definition. No proof is provided (sorry), but for auditing we only check the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural-language statement requires that {a_k} is an enumeration of the rational numbers, i.e., a function a : ℕ → ℚ that enumerates all rationals (typically surjective). The Lean theorem takes an arbitrary function `a : ℕ → ℚ` with no condition that it is an enumeration. Thus, the Lean statement is strictly stronger (it asserts uniform convergence for any sequence of rationals, not just an enumeration).
- Aside from that, the definitions of f_n and g_n match, including the sum from 1 to n with weights 2^{-k} and the shift x − a_k, as implemented via reindexing using `Finset.range n` and `k+1`.
- The conclusion “g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ” is faithfully encoded as `∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : ℝ, |g a n x| < ε`.

3) Final comparison:
- Difference: Missing the hypothesis that `a` enumerates ℚ. The Lean code claims the result for any `a : ℕ → ℚ`, not necessarily an enumeration. This is not logically equivalent to the original; it is a stronger statement and thus not a faithful translation under the strict auditing guidelines.
- All other parts (definitions of f_n, g_n, and the uniform convergence conclusion) are correct.

Therefore, the translation is almost correct but fails to include the essential “enumeration” assumption, so it is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem riemann_integrable_on_algebra {n : Nat} (R : Set (Fin n -> ℝ))` introduces an arbitrary subset R of ℝ^n (modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`). There is no assumption that R is a closed rectangle.
- `(is_riemann_integrable_on : Set (Fin n -> ℝ) -> ((Fin n -> ℝ) -> ℝ) -> Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate that takes a set R and a function `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` and returns a Prop. It is not tied to Mathlib’s notion of Riemann integrability; it’s just an abstract parameter.
- `(f g : (Fin n -> ℝ) -> ℝ) (a : ℝ)` are two functions on ℝ^n and a real scalar.
- `(hf : is_riemann_integrable_on R f) (hg : is_riemann_integrable_on R g)` assume f and g satisfy the arbitrary predicate on R.
- Conclusion: `is_riemann_integrable_on R (fun x => a * f x) ∧ is_riemann_integrable_on R (fun x => f x + g x) ∧ is_riemann_integrable_on R (fun x => f x * g x)` asserts closure of the predicate under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication on R. This is stated for the arbitrary predicate and arbitrary set R, not specifically for Riemann integrability nor closed rectangles.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is specifically about the set of Riemann integrable functions on a closed rectangle R ⊆ ℝ^n. It asserts closure under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication for that specific notion.
- The Lean code instead quantifies over an arbitrary predicate `is_riemann_integrable_on` and an arbitrary set R, with no connection to Mathlib’s Riemann integrability and no assumption that R is a closed rectangle. This is far more general and, in fact, generally false for an arbitrary predicate.
- There is no use of any Mathlib definition of Riemann integrability; the key concept is abstracted away, violating the guideline to use applicable Mathlib terms or faithfully define the intended concept.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Differences:
  - Missing hypothesis: R being a closed rectangle is not assumed in the Lean code.
  - Wrong concept: Riemann integrability is not used; an arbitrary predicate is used instead.
  - Overgeneralization: The theorem claims closure for any predicate on any set R.
  - Not an algebra structure per se; although closure properties are listed, the code does not specify the proper notion and domain constraints.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem does not faithfully state the original claim.

Given these discrepancies (especially the arbitrary predicate and absence of the closed rectangle assumption), the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `variable {n : Nat}` and using `(Fin n → ℝ)` encodes ℝ^n as functions from `Fin n` to ℝ.
- `theorem convex_on_implies_convex_combination {U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} {f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hd : DifferentiableOn ℝ f U) (hconv : ConvexOn ℝ U f) : ...` states: Let U ⊂ ℝ^n be open and f: ℝ^n → ℝ be a function that is differentiable on U and convex on U (in the Mathlib sense `ConvexOn ℝ U f`). Then the following holds.
- The conclusion: `∀ x y (hx : x ∈ U) (hy : y ∈ U) (t : ℝ) (ht : t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1), f (t • x + (1 - t) • y) ≤ t * f x + (1 - t) * f y` says: For all x, y in U and t in [0,1], we have the convexity inequality `f(t x + (1 - t) y) ≤ t f(x) + (1 - t) f(y)`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable under the auditing rules.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: U open in ℝ^n; f: U → ℝ differentiable; if f is convex on U, then for all x, y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], `f(tx+(1-t)y) ≤ t f(x) + (1-t) f(y)`.
- The Lean statement includes the same contextual hypotheses: U open (`IsOpen U`), f differentiable on U (`DifferentiableOn ℝ f U`), and f convex on U (`ConvexOn ℝ U f`). It concludes exactly the standard convexity inequality for all x, y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1]. This matches the intended result.
- The usage of `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with `DifferentiableOn ℝ f U` instead of `f : U → ℝ` is a standard Mathlib pattern and is faithful to “f : U → ℝ is differentiable” as a property on U. `ConvexOn ℝ U f` in Mathlib also entails the convexity of U and the inequality for convex combinations, aligning with the usual definition.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain modeling: ℝ^n as `(Fin n → ℝ)` is standard and faithful.
- Function type: The code takes `f` on the ambient space but restricts properties to `U`; this is equivalent to the natural language setup where `f` is defined on `U`.
- Assumptions: Includes openness and differentiability exactly as in the statement (though not needed for the inequality, they do not distort the meaning). No extraneous or missing core conditions.
- Inequality: Exactly the usual convexity inequality with `t ∈ [0,1]` and pointwise evaluation on U.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement, using standard Mathlib notions without vacuous placeholders or mismatches.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but nothing specific is used.
- variable {n : ℕ}: Fix a natural number n.
- variable {R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)}: R is an arbitrary subset of ℝ^n (represented as functions Fin n → ℝ).
- variable (riemann_integrable_on : ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop): Introduces an arbitrary predicate symbol intended to mean ""f is Riemann integrable on R"" but it is completely uninterpreted, not Mathlib’s notion.

- variable (outer_measure_zero : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop): Arbitrary predicate intended to mean ""outer measure zero""; not tied to Mathlib’s measure theory.

Theorem integral_eq_of_eq_off_null:
- Hypotheses:
  - hf : riemann_integrable_on f R and hg : riemann_integrable_on g R: These assert integrability of f and g on R, but via an uninterpreted predicate.
  - E : Set (Fin n → ℝ)
  - hE_closed : closed_set E: Claims E is closed via an uninterpreted predicate.
  - hE_null : outer_measure_zero E: Claims E has outer measure zero via an uninterpreted predicate.

- Conclusion: riemann_integral_on f R = riemann_integral_on g R: The two integrals are equal, but with an uninterpreted integral operator.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: R ⊂ ℝ^n is a closed rectangle; f, g : R → ℝ are Riemann integrable; ∃ closed E ⊆ R with outer measure zero and f = g on R \ E; conclude ∫_R f = ∫_R g.
- Mismatches and issues:
  1) R is required to be a closed rectangle in the NL statement. The Lean code has no assumption whatsoever about R being a rectangle (or closed, or measurable). This is missing.
  2) f and g are functions on R in the NL statement. The Lean code takes f, g : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ (full space) and then uses a predicate ""riemann_integrable_on f R"". This modeling can be acceptable, but here it relies on the uninterpreted predicate, so the intended meaning is not enforced. The docstring says ""f,g : R → ℝ"" but the code does not reflect that.
  3) The assumption E ⊆ R appears in the NL statement. The Lean code does not assume E ⊆ R; it only uses R \ E. While equality on R \ E does not require E ⊆ R, this is still a mismatch with the stated hypotheses.
  4) The properties ""closed"" and ""outer measure zero"" are modeled by arbitrary predicate variables closed_set and outer_measure_zero, not Mathlib’s IsClosed or measure-theoretic null property. They have no content, so the statement is not tied to the real topology/measure. This is a major red flag.
  5) The core objects ""Riemann integrable on"" and ""Riemann integral on"" are completely uninterpreted symbols rather than Mathlib’s notions (and in fact Mathlib does not generally provide a full multidimensional Riemann integral on arbitrary sets in this format). This makes the theorem vacuous with respect to the intended meaning.
  6) The theorem ends with by sorry, which is acceptable per instructions since we only audit the translation; however, the larger issue is that the auxiliary notions are not legitimate definitions of the mathematical concepts.

Overall faithfulness:
- The code does not use Mathlib’s definitions and instead replaces all key notions (integrability, integral, closedness, outer measure zero) with arbitrary, uninterpreted predicates/functions. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous placeholders.
- It also omits the crucial hypothesis that R is a closed rectangle and that E ⊆ R.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful formalization of the original statement.

Grade justification:
- Because the main mathematical notions are replaced by placeholders and a key hypothesis (R is a closed rectangle, and E ⊆ R) is missing, the translation fails. However, the skeleton of the intended result (equality of integrals when functions agree off a null set and are integrable) is recognizable, and if the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib concepts and the missing assumptions added, the theorem statement would be faithful. This corresponds to a mid-tier score under the rubric.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens namespaces: Uses Mathlib with MeasureTheory, Set, Filter, Topology. This sets up the environment for integrals and convergence.
- Variables: a, b : ℝ are real numbers; f : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ is a sequence of real-valued functions on ℝ; f_lim, g : ℝ → ℝ are real-valued functions.
- The theorem statement:
  - Hypothesis h: TendstoUniformlyOn (fun n => f n) f_lim atTop (Set.Icc a b)
    Meaning: The sequence f_n converges to f_lim uniformly on the closed interval [a, b].
  - Hypothesis hg: ContinuousOn g (Set.Icc a b)
    Meaning: g is continuous on [a, b].
  - Conclusion: Tendsto (fun n => intervalIntegral (fun x => f n x * g x) a b) atTop (𝓝 (intervalIntegral (fun x => f_lim x * g x) a b))
    Meaning: The sequence of integrals ∫_a^b f_n(x) g(x) dx converges (as n → ∞) to ∫_a^b f_lim(x) g(x) dx. Here intervalIntegral denotes the (Lebesgue) integral over the interval [a, b] with its orientation.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL: Suppose f_n → f uniformly on [a,b] and g is continuous on [a,b]. Prove that lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n g = ∫_a^b f g.
- Lean: Exactly assumes uniform convergence on [a,b] and continuity of g on [a,b], and concludes that the limit of interval integrals of f_n g equals the interval integral of f_lim g. The naming f_lim vs f is just a variable name difference and does not change meaning.
- The use of Mathlib's intervalIntegral corresponds to integration over [a, b]. While intervalIntegral is the Lebesgue interval integral (with orientation), on continuous functions this aligns with the classical integral, and the statement itself does not add extra hypotheses nor change the target equality—it explicitly states the limit of the integrals equals the integral of the limit times g.
- No auxiliary/vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated with meaningful Mathlib notions (TendstoUniformlyOn, ContinuousOn, intervalIntegral, Tendsto). The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing translation faithfulness.

Potential concerns checked:
- Measurability/integrability assumptions: The NL statement typically appears in contexts where integrals are well-defined; Mathlib's intervalIntegral is the standard way to encode integration over [a,b]. The code does not impose extraneous assumptions nor omit essential ones beyond what the NL states; thus it is a faithful formalization of the intended claim.
- Orientation (a ≤ b): intervalIntegral handles both cases; the NL statement usually assumes standard definite integral; allowing both orders is not a mismatch and does not weaken fidelity.

Final check: The mathematical meaning in Lean matches the NL statement: same hypotheses and same conclusion (limit equality of integrals of f_n g and f g on [a,b]). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib.
- `axiom RiemannIntegrableOn {n : ℕ} (f : (Fin n → Real) → Real) (R : Set (Fin n → Real)) : Prop`: Introduces an uninterpreted predicate symbol `RiemannIntegrableOn f R` meaning “f is Riemann integrable on the set R” for functions f: ℝ^n → ℝ and a set R ⊆ ℝ^n. This is a bare axiom/placeholder, not defined via Mathlib’s notions; it imposes no structure (no requirement that R is a rectangle, closed, etc.).
- `theorem max_min_riemann_integrable {n : ℕ} (R : Set (Fin n → Real)) (f g : (Fin n → Real) → Real) (hf : RiemannIntegrableOn f R) (hg : RiemannIntegrableOn g R) : RiemannIntegrableOn (fun x => Real.max (f x) (g x)) R ∧ RiemannIntegrableOn (fun x => Real.min (f x) (g x)) R := by sorry`: For any set R ⊆ ℝ^n and functions f, g: ℝ^n → ℝ which are integrable on R (in the sense of the placeholder axiom), concludes that max(f,g) and min(f,g) are integrable on R (again in that placeholder sense). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
Original statement: Let R ⊆ ℝ^n be a closed rectangle and f, g: R → ℝ be Riemann integrable. Show that φ(x)=max{f(x), g(x)} and ψ(x)=min{f(x), g(x)} are Riemann integrable on R.

Issues:
- The code uses an ad-hoc axiom `RiemannIntegrableOn` instead of Mathlib concepts. This is a placeholder and not a faithful encoding. Guideline violation: auxiliary predicate is vacuous/uninterpreted.
- The theorem assumes R is an arbitrary set, not a closed rectangle. The closed-rectangle hypothesis is completely missing. So the theorem is strictly stronger than the intended statement, hence not faithful.
- The domain of f and g in the code is the whole ℝ^n with a set predicate for integrability on R, whereas the natural statement has f, g: R → ℝ. This mismatch could be acceptable if everything else matched, but combined with the missing closed-rectangle condition it exacerbates the lack of faithfulness.
- The proof is `by sorry`. While our task focuses on statement translation, the use of a placeholder axiom plus an omitted proof is a strong red flag per the guidelines.

Step 3: Final comparison
They are not the same. Differences:
- Missing and crucial hypothesis: R being a closed rectangle is not encoded at all.
- Uses an uninterpreted, non-Mathlib placeholder predicate for Riemann integrability.
- Functions' types differ (ambient domain vs. restricted domain); acceptable in principle but here not tied to the closed-rectangle structure or any real Riemann framework.
- The theorem claims the result for any set R, which is not the original statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work over ℂ. We have coefficients a : ℕ → ℂ, a function f : ℂ → ℂ, and a sequence zseq : ℕ → ℂ.
- Main hypothesis (neighborhood equality to a power series): (∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ ∀ z : ℂ, |z| < r → f z = ∑' k, a k * z ^ k). This says there exists a radius r > 0 such that for all z with |z| < r, f(z) equals the (tsum) power series ∑ a_k z^k. This matches the common meaning of “f is represented by a convergent power series in a neighborhood of 0.”
- Nonzero sequence: (∀ n, zseq n ≠ 0). Exactly: the sequence terms are all nonzero.
- Convergence to 0: Tendsto zseq atTop (nhds (0 : ℂ)). Exactly: z_n → 0 in ℂ.
- Zeros along the sequence: (∀ n, f (zseq n) = 0). Exactly: f(z_n) = 0 for all n.
- Conclusion: ∀ k, a k = 0. Every coefficient is zero.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “Suppose f(z) = ∑ a_k z^k is a convergent power series and {z_n} is a sequence of nonzero complex numbers converging to 0, such that f(z_n) = 0 for all n. Show that a_k = 0 for every k.”
- The Lean hypothesis “there exists r > 0 and for all |z| < r, f z = ∑' a_k z^k” is a standard formalization of “f is given by a convergent power series around 0.” It makes explicit the neighborhood on which the series converges to f.
- The sequence assumptions in Lean exactly match: nonzero terms, convergence to 0, and f(z_n) = 0 for all n.
- The conclusion exactly matches: all coefficients a_k are zero.

Potential red flags considered:
- Use of tsum: In mathlib, writing f z = ∑' k, a k * z^k is the standard way to assert equality with the sum of the series. While tsum is defined even when a series is not summable, the statement explicitly asserts this equality for all z in an open ball, which is the intended formalization of “f equals its convergent power series on a neighborhood of 0.” This is in line with common mathlib practice; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are present.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given.
- The theorem hypotheses and conclusion are mathematically the same as the NL statement; no weakening or strengthening that alters meaning is present.

Final check: The two problems are the same. The Lean code faithfully formalizes the NL statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib definitions and theorems.
- `theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_several_vars_ders_2680 {n : ℕ} {f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ} {x0 : Fin n → ℝ} (h : ContDiffAt ℝ 1 f x0) : DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0 := by sorry`
  This states: For any natural number n, any function f from ℝ^n to ℝ (modeled as `Fin n → ℝ → ℝ`), and any point x0 in ℝ^n, if f is C^1 at x0 (i.e., `ContDiffAt ℝ 1 f x0`), then f is differentiable at x0 (`DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0`). The proof is omitted (sorry), but we only audit the statement.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""Suppose f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable in a neighborhood of x0 and that Df is continuous at x0. Show that f is differentiable at x0. (That is, C^1 implies differentiability.)""
- The hypothesis ""f is differentiable in a neighborhood of x0 and Df is continuous at x0"" is exactly the usual meaning of f being C^1 at x0.
- Mathlib’s `ContDiffAt ℝ 1 f x0` formalizes ""f is C^1 at x0"" (i.e., differentiable on a neighborhood with the derivative continuous at x0), so the Lean hypothesis matches the intended meaning.
- The conclusion ""f is differentiable at x0"" is exactly `DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0`.
- The parenthetical ""That is, C^1 implies differentiability"" is precisely what the Lean theorem states.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness and pitfalls.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib concepts are used.
- The domain `(Fin n → ℝ)` is a standard encoding of ℝ^n in Mathlib; codomain is ℝ, matching the statement.
- The theorem matches the intended logical content: C^1 at x0 implies differentiable at x0.
- While the natural language breaks C^1 into ""differentiable in a neighborhood"" plus ""Df continuous at x0"", the Lean code uses the single standard predicate `ContDiffAt ℝ 1`, which is the appropriate Mathlib formalization. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space (so this abstracts R^n), and f : E → ℝ. U ⊆ E is a set.
- Hypotheses: hU_convex : Convex ℝ U (U is convex). hfn : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (f is C^2 on U in the sense of mathlib; in particular, the second derivative exists and is continuous on U).
- Conclusion: There exists p : E → FormalMultilinearSeries ℝ E ℝ such that HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 f p U (p is the formal Taylor series of f up to order 2 on U), and moreover the following uniform estimate holds: for every compact K ⊆ U and every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h ∈ E with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ,
  | f (x + h) - (f x + (p x 1) (fun _ => h) + (1/2) * (p x 2) (fun _ => h)) | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
- Here (p x 1) is the 1-multilinear map corresponding to the first derivative at x, applied to h, and (p x 2) is the 2-multilinear map corresponding to the second derivative piece at x, applied to (h,h) by diagonal evaluation fun _ => h. The factor (1/2) is explicitly inserted in the statement.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: f : R^n → R is C^2 and its Hessian H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U. In classical terms: for each compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and h with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ,
  | f(x+h) − f(x) − Df(x)·h − (1/2) H_f(x)[h,h] | ≤ ε ‖h‖^2.
- The code generalizes R^n to an arbitrary finite-dimensional real normed space E; this is fine and faithful.
- ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U is an appropriate mathlib hypothesis capturing f being C^2 on U with continuous second derivative. So the regularity assumptions are faithful.
- They use a formal Taylor series p with HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 f p U to encode derivatives. This is a standard, legitimate mathlib way to talk about Taylor expansions; fine as an auxiliary existence.
- Uniformity on compact subsets is correctly expressed: the δ depends only on K and ε, not on x or h.
- The convexity of U plus the condition x ∈ K ⊆ U and x + h ∈ U fits the intended setting (convexity ensures the whole segment [x, x+h] stays in U, which is standard for Taylor remainders). This matches the intent.

Critical mismatch:
- In mathlib, the canonical p witnessing HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn is normalized so that p x k is the k-th derivative divided by k!. In particular, p x 2 equals (1/2) times the Hessian at x. Therefore, the standard Taylor polynomial is f x + (p x 1)(h) + (p x 2)(h,h) (without an extra 1/2).
- The code inserts an extra factor (1/2) multiplying (p x 2)(h,h), which makes the quadratic term equal to (1/2)·(p x 2)(h,h) = (1/2)·(1/2)·H_f(x)[h,h] = (1/4)·H_f(x)[h,h]. This is not the classical second-order Taylor polynomial.
- This is not a harmless tweak: if one uses the wrong quadratic coefficient, the difference f(x+h) − [f x + (p x 1)h + (1/2)(p x 2)(h,h)] divided by ‖h‖^2 generally tends to a nonzero limit depending on the Hessian, so the inequality ≤ ε‖h‖^2 cannot hold for all ε > 0 uniformly (unless the Hessian vanishes). Thus the statement expressed by the code is not equivalent to the standard one.

Other checks:
- No vacuous placeholders are introduced; all notions are standard mathlib definitions. The presence of `by sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Using E instead of R^n is fine.

Final comparison:
- Aside from the coefficient issue, the structure matches the NL statement well. However, the extra factor (1/2) in front of (p x 2) makes the quadratic term incorrect relative to how p is defined in mathlib and, hence, renders the translation not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def box (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := { x | ∀ i, a i ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ b i }`
  This defines the set [a,b] ⊆ ℝ^n (represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`), i.e., the product of closed intervals [a_i, b_i].
- `def has_zero_side (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Prop := ∃ i, a i = b i`
  This asserts that at least one coordinate interval is degenerate, i.e., some side length is zero.
- `def bounded_on {α : Type _} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : Prop := ∃ M : ℝ, 0 ≤ M ∧ ∀ x ∈ s, |f x| ≤ M`
  This says f is bounded on s in the usual sense.

  Placeholder: always true, not the actual Riemann integrability.
- `def integral_on {α : Type _} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : ℝ := 0`
  Placeholder: defines the integral to be 0 for any f and s.
- `theorem degenerate_box_integral ... : Riemann_integrable_on f (box a b) ∧ integral_on f (box a b) = 0 := by sorry`
  Main statement: Given a,b with a zero side, and any f bounded on the set `box a b`, conclude that f is Riemann integrable on that box and its integral is 0. Proof omitted.

2) Overall fidelity to the natural language statement:
- The intended math statement: If R ⊆ ℝ^n is a closed rectangle with one side of length 0, then every bounded f : R → ℝ is Riemann integrable on R and ∫_R f = 0.
- The code attempts to model R as `box a b` with the condition `has_zero_side a b`. That matches the idea of a closed rectangle with a zero-length side, though it does not enforce `a i ≤ b i` for all i; if some `a i > b i` the set is empty. The original statement implicitly assumes a standard closed rectangle (a_i ≤ b_i), but allowing emptiness does not break the conclusion.
- The function domain in the code is `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with boundedness assumed only on `box a b`. This is reasonably close to “f : R → ℝ bounded” since one can consider extensions; however, it is not an exact match of the type `f : R → ℝ`.
- Critical failure: `Riemann_integrable_on` is defined as `True` and `integral_on` is defined to be `0` for all inputs. These are vacuous placeholders, not faithful definitions. As a result, the theorem statement becomes trivial and does not capture the intended mathematical content. This directly violates the instruction that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous.
- Additionally, the code does not use Mathlib’s existing notions for Riemann integrability or integrals (e.g., Box, Riemann integration, or measure-theoretic integrals), which is a red flag per the guidelines.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The core mathematical predicates are replaced by placeholders (`True` and constantly `0`). Thus the Lean statement does not faithfully encode “Riemann integrable on R and the integral equals 0”; it encodes a vacuous truth. Also, the function is taken as defined on the ambient space rather than on R, which is acceptable only if one then uses a correct “integrable on a set” notion, which is missing here.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Given these issues, especially the vacuous definitions, the translation fails. If those placeholders were replaced with legitimate Mathlib notions, the rest of the setup (box, zero side, bounded_on) is close enough to be made faithful, but as written it is not.

The Lean statement says exactly: IsOpen S ↔ ∀ p ∈ S, ∃ ε: ℝ, 0 < ε ∧ Metric.ball p ε ⊆ S. Here Metric.ball is the open ball, matching B(p, ε). The quantifiers and conditions (ε > 0, containment) are exactly as stated.
- It uses standard Mathlib notions: MetricSpace, IsOpen, Metric.ball, and subset ⊆. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions, and no auxiliary definitions.

3) Final check for differences:
- There are no differences in mathematical meaning. The Lean theorem precisely encodes the given ""if and only if"" characterization of open sets in metric spaces using open balls. The use of real ε with 0 < ε matches the standard. The topology induced by the MetricSpace instance aligns with IsOpen. Everything is faithful.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  Translation: If x_n → l, then 0 ≤ max(l, 0). This is a standalone inequality about the value max(l, 0) and does not mention the limit of y_n or even y explicitly. The docstring claims it is about the limit of y_n, but the theorem statement does not assert anything about limits of y; it only asserts nonnegativity of max(l, 0).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: Let {x_n} be convergent and y_n = max{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≥ 0.
- The code includes a lemma that if x_n → l then y_n → max(l, 0), which is the right structural fact to deduce that lim y_n exists and equals max(l, 0). However, the ""in particular"" theorem does not state the desired conclusion about lim y_n; it only states 0 ≤ max(l, 0), without tying it to y_n's limit. The theorem name and docstring suggest the intended conclusion, but the formal statement falls short.

Final check:
- The two math problems are not the same as stated. The code does not explicitly assert that lim y_n ≥ 0. While combining the first theorem (tendsto of y_n to max(l, 0)) with the second inequality would yield the NL conclusion, the final theorem meant to express the ""in particular"" claim does not mention y_n or its limit. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Other checks:
- No vacuous or fake definitions: `y` is correctly defined, and Mathlib notions (`Filter.Tendsto`, `atTop`, `nhds`, `max`) are used appropriately.
- The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task; we focus on statements.

Given the mismatch in the final statement, although the components are nearly sufficient, the translation does not faithfully state the desired conclusion.

Assessment vs natural language statement:
- The NL statement: Let A be an n-by-n matrix and B be the matrix of cofactors of A. Show det(B) = det(A)^{n−1}.
- In mathlib, Matrix.adjugate A is (by standard convention) the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Determinant is invariant under transpose, so det(adjugate A) = det(cofactor matrix of A). Therefore the Lean statement det (adjugate A) = det A ^ (card n − 1) is mathematically equivalent to det(B) = det(A)^{n−1}.
- Using Fintype n with Fintype.card n in place of a natural dimension n is the standard Lean encoding and is faithful. The exponent uses natural subtraction (card n − 1), which corresponds to n−1 in the statement.
- No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is the object being asserted. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but we only judge the faithfulness of the statement.

Final check: The only superficial difference is adjugate vs cofactor matrix; since det is unchanged by transpose, the two formulations are equivalent. Thus the Lean theorem faithfully translates the NL statement.

- The natural language statement: Let U ⊆ ℝ^n be open, f: U → ℝ continuous. Let G = { (x, f(x)) ∈ ℝ^{n+1} : x ∈ U }. Show G has measure zero in ℝ^{n+1}.
- The Lean code models ℝ^n as (Fin n → ℝ) and ℝ^{n+1} as (Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ, which is standard and faithful.
- It defines U : Set (Fin n → ℝ) with IsOpen U, matching ""U open"".
- It takes f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ together with hf : ContinuousOn f U, which is equivalent data to a function f: U → ℝ that is continuous; only values on U are used in the graph definition, so this is faithful.
- The set { x : (Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ | x.1 ∈ U ∧ x.2 = f x.1 } is exactly the graph G over U.
- The conclusion volume (that set) = 0 is exactly ""G has Lebesgue measure zero in ℝ^{n+1}"".
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- Ambient space: ℝ^{n+1} vs (ℝ^n) × ℝ — canonically identified; acceptable.
- Domain of f: U → ℝ vs (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ with continuity on U — equivalent for this statement, since only the restriction to U matters.
- Measure notion: volume is Lebesgue measure; matches ""measure zero"".
No substantive differences affecting meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

- The Lean code precisely imposes absolute summability of a and b via Summable (|a n|) and Summable (|b n|), defines c_n exactly as the finite sum over k = 0..n, and concludes absolute summability of c along with the equality of sums using tsum. This matches the statement.
- Domain: The code specializes to real sequences (ℝ). The natural language does not specify a field; reals are a standard and faithful specialization. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; c is correctly defined.

- def riemannIntegral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0: Defines the Riemann integral of f on [a,b] as identically 0. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the real integral. Red flag.

Since riemannIntegral is defined to be 0 for all functions, the conclusion reads: f is integrable (trivially) and Tendsto (fun n => 0) atTop (nhds 0), i.e., the constant-0 sequence tends to 0. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but per instructions we evaluate only the statement/definitions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let f_n : [a,b] → ℝ be Riemann integrable and suppose f_n → f uniformly on [a,b]. Then f is Riemann integrable and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n.

Lean statement aim: Essentially the same logical shape: Riemann integrability of each f_n on [a,b], uniform convergence on [a,b], conclude Riemann integrability of f and convergence of the integrals to ∫ f. However, the key parts are replaced by placeholders:
- RiemannIntegrableOn is defined as True, so the hypothesis and conclusion about integrability are meaningless.
- riemannIntegral is defined as 0, so the limit-of-integrals statement is about a constant-zero sequence, not the actual integrals.
Therefore, while the quantification for uniform convergence is reasonable, the crucial notions (integrability and the integral) are not the real ones, making the statement vacuous and not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
They are not. Differences:
- The code replaces the Riemann integrability predicate with True, losing all content.
- The code replaces the Riemann integral with the constant 0 function, losing all content.
- Consequently, the theorem’s conclusion becomes trivial and does not assert the genuine equality lim ∫ f_n = ∫ f.
- Also, the code doesn’t use the appropriate mathlib definitions (e.g., Riemann integral or interval integrable notions) as required by the guideline to use the latest applicable mathlib terms. This is a strong red flag.

Given these vacuous placeholders, the translation fails. If those placeholders were replaced by legitimate mathlib notions, the theorem statement would be faithful, so this fits the rubric for a mid-level grade.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Parameters: c : ℕ → ℝ, a ρ : ℝ with hρ : 0 < ρ. Define I := {x | |x - a| < ρ}. Let f : ℝ → ℝ. Hypothesis hf: for all x ∈ I, the series ∑ c n (x - a)^n converges to f x (HasSum ... (f x)).
- Conclusion: (i) For all x ∈ I, f is differentiable at x (DifferentiableAt ℝ f x). (ii) For all x ∈ I, there exists a real number s such that the termwise derivative series ∑ (n+1) * c (n+1) * (x - a)^n converges to s, and f has derivative s at x (HasDerivAt f s x). This encodes that f'(x) equals the sum of the derivative series at x.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL statement: Given a power series ∑ c_n (x - a)^n with radius of convergence 0 < ρ ≤ ∞, let I = {x | |x - a| < ρ}, and let f be its sum on I. Then f is differentiable and f'(x) = ∑ (n+1)c_{n+1}(x - a)^n, and the derivative series has radius of convergence equal to ρ.
- The Lean statement correctly captures: (a) assuming the series sums to f on I, (b) f is differentiable on I, and (c) for each x ∈ I, the derivative equals the sum of the termwise derivative series (via existence of s with both HasSum and HasDerivAt). This part is faithful.
- However, the Lean statement does not formalize the notion of “radius of convergence” at all. It only assumes convergence on I and proves convergence of the derivative series on I. It does not assert that ρ is the (maximal) radius of convergence for the original series, nor that the derivative series has radius exactly ρ. It also does not state any divergence or maximality outside I, which is necessary to conclude equality of radii and not just a lower bound.
- The NL statement allows ρ = ∞, whereas the Lean code models ρ as a real number with 0 < ρ and does not encode the ∞ case. While one can treat any finite ρ < ∞ or use any positive ρ in the ∞ case, the explicit “ρ ≤ ∞” and the equality of radii are not captured.
- Domain: The NL has f : I → ℝ; Lean uses f : ℝ → ℝ but restricts hypotheses and conclusions to I. This is acceptable and equivalent in spirit.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different in a key aspect: the Lean theorem does not state that the derivative series has radius of convergence equal to ρ; it only proves convergence on I. It also does not encode that ρ is the actual radius of convergence for the original series, nor the possibility ρ = ∞. Thus, the translation omits an essential part of the original statement regarding radii.
- Everything about differentiability and identification of the derivative as the termwise differentiated series on I is faithfully captured.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to missing radius-of-convergence equality (and the ∞ case). No vacuous definitions are used; the mismatch is conceptual rather than formal placeholders.

- Lean encoding: ℝ^n and ℝ^m are represented as (Fin n → ℝ) and (Fin m → ℝ). The derivative in Mathlib is a continuous linear map, so the equality is stated with A.toContinuousLinearMap, which is the canonical way to view A as a continuous linear map in finite dimensions. The first theorem asserts HasFderivAt A A x for all x (by having x as a parameter), which implies differentiability and identifies the derivative. The second theorem restates the equality for fderiv. This is fully faithful to the natural language statement.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements (with proofs omitted) are provided. The concepts used (HasFderivAt, fderiv, ContinuousLinearMap) are standard Mathlib notions for Fréchet differentiability over normed spaces.

3) Final check: same or different?

The minor type-level detail ""as a continuous linear map"" matches the analytic notion of the derivative and is exactly what the NL statement intends by ""as a linear map"" in finite dimensions. The domain/codomain and quantification over every x are correctly captured. No extraneous or missing assumptions.

- The definition matches the problem’s formulation (using [−k, k] for all k ∈ ℕ).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports Mathlib. Fine.
- Declares theorem `maximum_principle_harmonic` with:
  - `U : Set (ℝ × ℝ)`, `f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ`.
  - Hypotheses: `hU : IsOpen U` (U is open), `hconn : IsConnected U` (U is connected), `hC2 : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` (f is C^2 on U).
  - `hlap : True` with a comment that this is a placeholder for the Laplacian condition f_xx + f_yy = 0 on U. This is a vacuous hypothesis, not the real harmonicity assumption.
  - A point `p ∈ U` and `hmax : ∀ q ∈ U, f q ≤ f p` encoding that f attains a (global) maximum at p on U.
  - Conclusion: `∀ q ∈ U, f q = f p` meaning f is constant on U.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement assumes f is harmonic on U, i.e., C^2 and f_{xx}+f_{yy}=0 on U.
- The code includes the C^2 assumption correctly via `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U`.
- However, the crucial harmonicity condition is replaced by `hlap : True`, which is a vacuous placeholder. This removes the essential hypothesis that the Laplacian vanishes on U.
- As written, the Lean statement claims: any C^2 function on an open connected set that attains a maximum at an interior point is constant. This is strictly stronger than (and not equivalent to) the maximum principle for harmonic functions, and is generally false. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.
- Representing f as a function on ℝ² with properties restricted to U is acceptable and faithful; likewise, encoding ""attains a maximum at p"" as `∀ q ∈ U, f q ≤ f p` is fine.

Other checks:
- There are no additional auxiliary definitions; the only red flag is the vacuous hypothesis `hlap : True`, explicitly noted as a placeholder. Per the guidelines, this causes the translation to fail.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task; the issue is with the statement, not the proof.

Final comparison:
- The intended statement: harmonic (C^2 with Laplacian zero) + interior maximum ⇒ constant.
- The Lean statement: C^2 + open/connected + interior maximum ⇒ constant, with harmonicity replaced by `True`.
- These are different; the key hypothesis is missing, so the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- It uses reasonable Mathlib notions where applicable but replaces the key condition with a vacuous placeholder. If the placeholder were replaced by an accurate Laplacian-vanishing hypothesis on U, the statement would be faithful. Hence, per the rubric, this fits: makes up a vacuous placeholder but would be faithful if fixed.

1) Missing containment P_j ⊆ U in the Lean statement. The original explicitly requires each closed rectangle be contained in U. This is not encoded.
2) Missing Jordan measurability assumption on S. The Lean theorem assumes only compactness. Even if the result might hold without Jordan measurability, the translation must match the stated hypotheses; here it does not.
3) Minor: The Lean statement redundantly asserts closedness of Icc (which is always true) and does not enforce a ≤ b coordinatewise, potentially allowing empty rectangles; this is usually harmless, but the main issue is the missing containment in U.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It states a stronger existence claim (cover by rectangles anywhere in ℝ^n) under weaker hypotheses (no Jordan measurability) than the original. The most critical mismatch is omitting the requirement P_j ⊆ U.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem dirichlet_bounded_variation (x lambda_seq : ℕ → ℝ)`: We consider two real sequences x_n and λ_n indexed by natural numbers.
- `h_bound : ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ n : ℕ, abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) (fun i => x i)) ≤ M`: There exists a real M such that for all n, the absolute value of the partial sum S_n = ∑_{i=0}^n x_i is bounded by M. This is the hypothesis that the partial sums of the series ∑ x_n are bounded.
- `h_tendsto : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n, n ≥ N → abs (lambda_seq n) ≤ ε`: λ_n → 0, stated in the ε–N definition.
- `hvar : Summable (fun n => abs (lambda_seq (n+1) - lambda_seq n))`: The series ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges (finite total variation of λ).
- Conclusion: `Summable (fun n => lambda_seq n * x n)`: The series ∑ λ_n x_n converges (summable in ℝ, i.e., convergent, not necessarily absolutely).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL: ""Suppose ∑ x_n is a series with bounded partial sums"" matches `h_bound` (bounded partial sums, up to indexing starting at 0 in Lean vs 1 in NL, which is immaterial for boundedness).
- NL: ""λ_n → 0"" matches `h_tendsto`.
- NL: ""∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges"" matches `hvar`.
- NL: ""Show that ∑ λ_n x_n converges"" matches the conclusion `Summable (fun n => lambda_seq n * x n)`.
- The code uses ℝ; the NL statement does not specify the field, but real-valued is a standard and faithful specialization.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing shift (starting sums at n=0 vs n=1) does not change the property of bounded partial sums or convergence of the series of differences, so it is faithful.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions (Summable, Finset.sum, abs). There are no vacuous placeholders.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but the task only requires checking the statement/translation.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

  Translation: Let X be a metric space and K ⊆ X be compact. For any ε > 0, there exists a finite set s of points of X such that K is contained in the union over x ∈ s of the open metric balls of radius ε centered at x. There are no auxiliary definitions; the statement is precise: K ⊆ ⋃_{x∈s} B(x, ε).

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that K is the union of finitely many open balls of radius ε, for every ε > 0.""
- The Lean statement: There exists a finite set of points such that K is covered by (is a subset of) a union of ε-balls.

3) Are they the same?
- The phrase ""is the union of"" usually means equality: K = ⋃_{i=1}^n B(x_i, ε). The Lean code asserts only inclusion K ⊆ ⋃_{i=1}^n B(x_i, ε). These are not equivalent: equality is strictly stronger and generally false in this context (the union of open balls typically extends beyond K). The standard true theorem is the covering statement (total boundedness), matching the Lean code.
- Other aspects (metric space, compact K, ε > 0, use of open balls, finitely many centers in X) are aligned.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully states the standard covering property but does not match the stronger ""is the union of"" phrasing in the natural language statement. Hence, not a faithful translation under a strict reading.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`: bring in Mathlib and filter notation.
- The theorem statement:
  - `theorem monotone_sequence_const_from_k {x : ℕ → ℝ} (hmono : Monotone x) {k : ℕ} (hlim : Tendsto x atTop (nhds (x k))) : ∀ n, k ≤ n → x n = x k := by sorry`
  - In words: Let x be a sequence of real numbers (a function ℕ → ℝ). Assume x is monotone (Monotone means nondecreasing in Mathlib). Let k be a natural number. Suppose x converges (as n → ∞) to x k, i.e., Tendsto x atTop (nhds (x k)). Then for every n with k ≤ n, x n = x k. No auxiliary definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: A convergent monotone sequence {x_n} with lim x_n = x_k satisfies x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k.
- The Lean statement assumes exactly the key hypothesis “lim x_n = x_k” (expressed as Tendsto to nhds (x k)), plus monotonicity, and concludes constancy from k onward. This captures the intended conclusion directly.
- Differences:
  - Direction of monotonicity: In Mathlib, `Monotone` means nondecreasing. The natural language “monotone” is often used to mean either nondecreasing or nonincreasing. The Lean theorem covers only the nondecreasing case; it omits the nonincreasing case. The statement is true in both directions, so this is a narrowing of scope.
  - Codomain: Lean fixes ℝ; the natural language did not explicitly specify the codomain, though in standard analysis this typically means real sequences. This is a mild restriction but likely aligned with the intended context.
  - Indexing: Lean sequences are indexed by ℕ starting at 0, whereas the natural language uses n ≥ 1. Since the conclusion is only for n ≥ k, this difference is immaterial to the content.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Monotone, Tendsto, atTop, nhds) and introduces no bogus auxiliary definitions.

3) Final check: The core mathematical content matches except for the monotonicity direction. The Lean code faithfully represents the increasing (nondecreasing) case but does not include the decreasing case, which the natural language may have intended by “monotone.” Hence it is very close but not fully faithful if “monotone” was meant in the broad sense.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- Variables and context: We work in ℝ^n, modeled as functions Fin n → ℝ with the standard norm. We consider a set U ⊆ ℝ^n and a function f : ℝ^n → ℝ.
- Assumptions: hU : Convex ℝ U asserts that U is convex. hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U asserts that f is C^2 (twice continuously Fréchet differentiable) on U. This entails that the first and second derivatives exist and are continuous on U (i.e., the Hessian is continuous).
- Statement (uniform-in-x formulation): For every compact K ⊆ U and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, we have
  | f(x + h) − f(x) − (fderiv ℝ f x)(h) − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x)(h))(h) | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the (first) Fréchet derivative at x, a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ; and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the derivative of the derivative map, i.e., the second derivative at x viewed as E →L[ℝ] (E →L[ℝ] ℝ). Applying it twice to h gives the quadratic term corresponding to the Hessian acting on (h, h). The 1/2 factor matches the standard second-order Taylor formula.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 and H_f continuous in a convex set U. Show the remainder in the second-order Taylor approximation is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- Lean: Assumes U convex and f ∈ C^2 on U (ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U), and asserts that for every compact K ⊆ U, the remainder R(x,h) := f(x+h) − f(x) − Df(x) h − (1/2) D^2 f(x)[h,h] satisfies |R(x,h)| ≤ ε ‖h‖^2 for ‖h‖ < δ, uniformly in x ∈ K, with the side condition x + h ∈ U. This is the standard epsilon–delta formulation of “R(x,h) = o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.” The use of fderiv of (fun y => fderiv f y) captures the Hessian/second derivative correctly in Mathlib. Quantifiers over compact K ⊆ U are present and uniformity is ensured by δ depending only on ε and K (not on x). The side condition x + h ∈ U is natural and matches the standard local formulation when the domain is restricted to U.
- Regularity assumptions: “C^2 and Hessian continuous” are redundant in usual terminology; ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U implies the Hessian (second derivative) is continuous. So the assumptions match or are slightly stronger, not weaker.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Domain/codomain: ℝ^n → ℝ in both.
- Set U convex: required in both; present as hU.
- Regularity: C^2 with continuous Hessian on U: encoded as ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U.
- Conclusion: Uniform little-o of order 2 on compact subsets: encoded via the uniform ε–δ bound |R| ≤ ε‖h‖^2 for small ‖h‖, uniformly in x ∈ K, with x + h ∈ U. This is equivalent to the stated uniform o(‖h‖^2) property.
- Taylor polynomial used: up to second order, with the 1/2 factor and the correct second derivative applied twice; consistent with the Hessian term.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for a translation audit.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient setting is a type X equipped with a PseudoMetricSpace structure (so distances can be zero for distinct points). K is a subset of X with hK : IsCompact K.
- The theorem states: For every ε > 0, there exists a finite set s : Finset X such that K is contained in the union of open ε-balls centered at points of s. Formally, K ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ s, Metric.ball x ε.
Interpretation:
- This is the standard covering formulation of “there exists a finite ε-net” where the ε-net is represented by the finite set of centers s, and the union of ε-balls around s covers K.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: In a metric space (X,d), for compact K ⊆ X, for every ε > 0 there exists a finite ε-net for K.
- Lean: Uses a pseudometric space rather than a metric space. This is a generalization (stronger hypothesis), not identical. Being extra harsh, this is a difference.
- More importantly, the Lean statement does not require that the ε-net lie inside K. It merely asserts the existence of a finite subset s of X whose ε-balls cover K. Many standard definitions of an “ε-net for K” require the net to be a subset of K. The Lean statement allows centers outside K, which is a strictly weaker requirement. This is a substantive mismatch unless one adopts a convention that ε-nets need not lie in K.
- All other aspects (compactness of K, quantification over ε > 0, finiteness of the net, open balls) align with the intended meaning.

Final check:
- Differences found:
  1) PseudoMetricSpace vs MetricSpace (generalization).
  2) Centers of the ε-net not required to lie in K.
- Due to (2), the Lean statement is weaker than the likely intended statement if one expects the ε-net to be a subset of K. Hence, not a fully faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the statement is mathematically meaningful and very close to the intended result. However, the two differences above prevent full faithfulness. Thus, a high but not perfect score.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem differentiable_at_of_deriv_tendsto {a b c L : ℝ} (hab : a < b) (hc : c ∈ Ioo a b) (f : ℝ → ℝ)`
  States a theorem for real numbers a, b, c, L with a < b, c in (a, b), and a function f: ℝ → ℝ.
- `(hcont : ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b))`
  f is continuous on the open interval (a, b).
- `(hdiff : ∀ x ∈ (Ioo a b \ {c}), DifferentiableAt ℝ f x)`
  f is differentiable at every point x in (a, b) except possibly at c.
- `(hlim : Filter.Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) (nhdsWithin c (Ioo a b \ {c})) (nhds L))`
  As x → c within (a, b) with x ≠ c, the derivative f'(x) tends to L.
- `: DifferentiableAt ℝ f c ∧ deriv f c = L`
  Conclusion: f is differentiable at c and f'(c) = L.

Step 2: Assess if it matches the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let f: (a, b) → ℝ be continuous and differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}. Assume lim_{x→c} f'(x) = L exists. Prove f is differentiable at c and f'(c) = L.

- Domain: The NL function is defined on (a, b); the Lean function is defined on ℝ but all hypotheses and the limit are restricted to (a, b). This is standard and faithful because (a, b) is open and differentiability/continuity at interior points depends only on values in a neighborhood contained in (a, b).
- Continuity: `ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b)` matches “f is continuous on (a, b).”
- Differentiability: The Lean hypothesis uses `DifferentiableAt` at every x ∈ (a, b) \ {c}, which matches “differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}.” On an open set, this aligns with the usual notion.
- Limit of derivative: `Tendsto (deriv f) (nhdsWithin c (Ioo a b \ {c})) (nhds L)` precisely encodes “lim_{x→c, x∈(a,b), x≠c} f'(x) = L.”
- Conclusion: Exactly “f is differentiable at c and f'(c) = L.”

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only a theorem statement with a proof hole, which is allowed per the instructions.
- The only superficial difference is that Lean makes f a global ℝ → ℝ function and uses `ContinuousOn`/`DifferentiableAt` on the interval; this is mathematically equivalent to the NL assumptions for an open interval.
- The use of `nhdsWithin c (Ioo a b \ {c})` correctly encodes the punctured limit in the interval.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and precise formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code works over a normed field 𝕜 and normed 𝕜-vector spaces X and Y. It assumes X and Y are complete (CompleteSpace X and CompleteSpace Y), i.e. Banach spaces.
- A is given as a continuous linear map A : X →L[𝕜] Y (i.e., a bounded linear operator).
- The hypothesis h asserts that A, viewed as a function X → Y via A.toLinearMap, is bijective (one-to-one and onto).
- The conclusion asserts the existence of B : Y →L[𝕜] X, a continuous linear map, such that B ∘ A = id on X and A ∘ B = id on Y (equalities are stated at the level of LinearMap via .toLinearMap and comp). This says B is the (two-sided) inverse of A and is bounded/continuous.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let X, Y be normed vector spaces and A ∈ L(X,Y). If A is one-to-one and onto, then A^{-1} is bounded. It suggests using the open mapping theorem, or, if unfamiliar, to give a proof assuming completeness of X and Y.
- The Lean theorem states exactly that for Banach spaces X and Y, a bijective bounded linear map A has a bounded inverse B which is a continuous linear map and inverse to A. This is precisely the bounded inverse theorem formulation under the (permitted) completeness assumption. The conclusion matches “A^{-1} is bounded” by exhibiting a continuous linear map B that is the inverse.

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumptions: The code assumes completeness of both X and Y. The problem statement allows (indeed suggests) a proof under completeness of X and Y if one does not appeal to the open mapping theorem, so this is acceptable. While the most general statement does not require Y to be complete (only X needs to be Banach for the open mapping theorem approach), the exercise explicitly permits assuming completeness of both, so this is not a mismatch.
- Field generality: The code works over an arbitrary normed field 𝕜, which is a harmless and standard generalization of the usual ℝ or ℂ case.
- Formulation: The code’s conclusion exhibits an actual B : Y →L X with two-sided inverse properties, which is the canonical formalization of “A^{-1} is bounded.” There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the exercise’s content (under the allowed completeness assumption), with standard mathlib notions and no red flags.

- The original statement: For an outer measure m* on ℝ^n, if for every ε > 0 there exists Y ⊇ X with m*(Y) ≤ ε, then m*(X) = 0.
- The Lean theorem assumes only nonnegativity and monotonicity of mstar (both properties of any outer measure) and concludes mstar X = 0 under the same ε-approximation hypothesis. This is a slight generalization, but it remains faithful: any outer measure on ℝ^n satisfies these properties, so the Lean statement implies the original.
- The domain ℝ^n is represented as Fin n → ℝ, which is standard. The quantifiers and inclusion conditions match exactly. The conclusion matches: m*(X) = 0.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Difference: Code works with a generic nonnegative, monotone set function to ℝ instead of Mathlib's OuterMeasure (which maps to ℝ≥∞). This is a benign generalization; it still covers the original case and does not weaken the hypothesis in a way that would misrepresent the claim. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The property used in the argument (nonnegativity and monotonicity) are precisely what is needed.
- No other discrepancies: All quantifiers, types, and relationships (⊆, ≤, ε > 0) align with the natural language statement.

- import Mathlib: Imports Mathlib.
- universe u: Universe declaration.

  - Riemann_integrable_on {α} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : Prop: An ad hoc predicate asserting Riemann integrability on a set. This is a placeholder axiom, not Mathlib’s notion.
  - integral_on {α} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : ℝ: An ad hoc function assigning a real number as the “integral” of f over s. Placeholder.

  - outer_measure_zero {α} (s : Set α) : Prop: An ad hoc predicate meaning s has outer measure zero. Placeholder.
- theorem integral_zero_implies_zero_outside_measure_zero
  - Parameters: n : ℕ; R : Set (Fin n → ℝ); f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ.
  - Hypotheses:
    - h_rect : is_closed_rectangle R: R is a closed rectangle (via placeholder predicate).
    - h_nonneg : ∀ x ∈ R, 0 ≤ f x: f is nonnegative on R.
    - h_int : Riemann_integrable_on f R: f is Riemann integrable on R (placeholder).
    - h_zero : integral_on f R = 0: The integral of f over R is zero (placeholder).
  - Conclusion: ∃ E : Set (Fin n → ℝ), outer_measure_zero E ∧ (∀ x ∈ R \ E, f x = 0): There exists a set E (subset of the ambient space) of outer measure zero such that f vanishes on R minus E.
  - Proof omitted by sorry.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let R ⊂ ℝ^n be a closed rectangle and f : R → ℝ be Riemann integrable with f ≥ 0 on R. If ∫_R f = 0, then there exists E ⊂ R of outer measure zero such that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R \ E.

Similarities:
- Domain is ℝ^n represented as Fin n → ℝ: correct.
- R is assumed to be a closed rectangle: the code uses a predicate is_closed_rectangle R.
- f is nonnegative on R: captured by h_nonneg.
- f is Riemann integrable on R and integral equals 0: captured by h_int and h_zero.
- Conclusion aims for existence of a null exceptional set E so that f vanishes off E in R: the code states f x = 0 for all x ∈ R \ E and outer_measure_zero E.

Differences / Issues:
1) Use of vacuous placeholders: The predicates Riemann_integrable_on, integral_on, is_closed_rectangle, outer_measure_zero are declared as axioms without any connection to Mathlib’s existing definitions (e.g., Riemann integrability on boxes, Lebesgue outer measure). This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders and not using applicable Mathlib terms.
2) Missing subset condition E ⊂ R: The natural language requires E ⊂ R. The code’s conclusion only asserts E is a subset of the ambient space with outer_measure_zero E, and uses R \ E in the pointwise claim, but never requires E ⊆ R. This is a strictly weaker assertion. Even if one could post-process to E ∩ R, the code does not state that and, with placeholders, we cannot infer stability of “outer_measure_zero” under intersection.
3) Ambiguity of “outer measure zero”: The natural language means Lebesgue outer measure on ℝ^n; the code’s predicate outer_measure_zero is an abstract Prop over any type α, not tied to Lebesgue outer measure on ℝ^n.
4) Not using Mathlib structures: Mathlib has standard ways to talk about rectangles (e.g., Icc boxes) and measures; the code introduces ad hoc axioms instead.

Step 3: Final check: Are they the same?
No. The code is not a faithful translation because it replaces key concepts (Riemann integrability, the integral, closed rectangle, outer measure zero) by vacuous axioms, and it also omits the requirement that E ⊂ R. Therefore, even fixing the placeholders to use Mathlib definitions, the current theorem statement is still weaker than the original due to the missing E ⊆ R condition.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {x lam : ℕ → ℝ}`: We consider two real sequences x_n and λ_n indexed by natural numbers n = 0,1,2,....
- The theorem statement `jirilebl_ra_ch_seq_ser_4414` assumes:
  - `h_bound : ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ n : ℕ, abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) (fun i => x i)) ≤ C`:
    The partial sums of x_n, namely S_n = ∑_{i=0}^n x_i, are uniformly bounded in absolute value by some constant C.
  - `h_lam : Filter.Tendsto lam Filter.atTop (nhds (0 : ℝ))`:
    λ_n → 0 as n → ∞.
  - `h_diff : Summable fun n => abs (lam (n+1) - lam n)`:
    The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges.
- Conclusion: `Summable fun n => lam n * x n`:
  The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ λ_n x_n converges.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL statement: For a series ∑_{n=1}^∞ x_n with bounded sequence of partial sums, and a sequence {λ_n} with λ_n → 0 and ∑_{n=1}^∞ |λ_{n+1}−λ_n| convergent, show ∑_{n=1}^∞ λ_n x_n converges.
- The Lean theorem matches the structure exactly: bounded partial sums of x_n, λ_n → 0, and summable absolute differences imply the series ∑ λ_n x_n is summable.

Step 3: Check for mismatches or red flags.
- Indexing: Lean starts sums at n=0; the NL statement starts at n=1. These are equivalent up to finitely many initial terms and do not affect convergence or boundedness of partial sums. This is a minor indexing shift, not a substantive mismatch.
- Domain: Lean works over ℝ. The NL statement does not specify the field; commonly such problems are over ℝ (or ℂ). The Lean statement is a faithful specialization to ℝ; not a contradiction but slightly more specific.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. All hypotheses are standard Mathlib notions: Tendsto, Summable, Finset.sum.
- The conclusion exactly asserts convergence (Summable) of the weighted series.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the NL statement, with only minor indexing and domain specialization differences that do not change the mathematical meaning of the claim. Given the instruction to be harsh, I note these minor differences and assign a 9 rather than 10, but the translation is essentially correct.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line into natural language.
- Context: X and Y are real normed vector spaces (NormedAddCommGroup + NormedSpace ℝ). The type X →L[ℝ] Y is Mathlib's space L(X,Y) of bounded linear operators with the operator norm ‖·‖.
- theorem opNorm_add_le (A B : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖A + B‖ ≤ ‖A‖ + ‖B‖: For bounded linear maps A, B, the operator norm satisfies the triangle inequality. The expression A + B is an element of X →L[ℝ] Y, hence implicitly asserts the sum of bounded linear maps is bounded.
- theorem opNorm_smul (c : ℝ) (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖c • A‖ = |c| * ‖A‖: For a scalar c and a bounded linear map A, the operator norm is absolutely homogeneous; in particular c • A is again a bounded linear map.
- theorem opNorm_nonneg (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : 0 ≤ ‖A‖: Nonnegativity of the operator norm.
- theorem opNorm_eq_zero_iff (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖A‖ = 0 ↔ A = 0: Definiteness of the operator norm.
- theorem operator_norm_is_norm: Bundled statement listing the norm axioms on L(X,Y): nonnegativity, definiteness, triangle inequality, and absolute homogeneity.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original asks: (i) If A,B are linear and bounded, then A+B is bounded. (ii) If α ∈ ℝ, then αA is bounded. (iii) ‖·‖ on L(X,Y) is a norm.
- The code uses the Mathlib type of bounded linear maps. Writing A + B and c • A inside norms presupposes that these operations produce bounded linear maps in L(X,Y). So the closure under addition and scalar multiplication is implicitly expressed by well-typedness, and the theorems further state standard norm properties (triangle inequality and homogeneity), which are stronger than just boundedness.
- The final theorem operator_norm_is_norm packages exactly the norm axioms on L(X,Y), matching “‖·‖ is a norm on L(X,Y).”

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Field: The natural language uses ℝ explicitly (α ∈ ℝ), and the code uses ℝ; consistent.
- The code does not have a standalone theorem whose conclusion is explicitly “A + B is bounded” or “c • A is bounded,” but the expressions A + B and c • A are terms of type X →L[ℝ] Y, so boundedness is built-in. Additionally, the provided theorems assert the corresponding norm properties, which are in line with the intended results.
- No vacuous placeholders; all concepts are genuine Mathlib notions. Proofs are omitted (sorry), which is allowed per instructions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful. Minor nit: the closure under addition/scalar multiplication is implicit rather than stated as separate theorems, but the code clearly addresses the intended facts and adds the norm properties required. Hence a near-perfect match.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- Context: E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space (so this generalizes ℝ^n). f : E → ℝ. U : Set E.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
  - convU : Convex ℝ U — U is convex.
  - hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U — f is twice continuously differentiable on U (C^2 on U).
- Statement: For every compact K ⊆ U, and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ ≠ 0 and ‖h‖ < δ, we have
  - x + h ∈ U, and
  - | f (x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
- Notes on expressions:
  - fderiv ℝ f x : E →L[ℝ] ℝ is the Fréchet derivative at x, which corresponds to the gradient dot h in ℝ^n.
  - fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the derivative of the derivative at x, mapping h to a linear functional; applying that functional to h gives the quadratic form associated to the Hessian at x applied to (h, h). Thus the term (1/2) * ((...) h) h encodes (1/2) h^T H_f(x) h.
- The quantification expresses the uniform little-o(‖h‖^2) on compact K: for any ε>0, there is δ>0 (independent of x ∈ K) such that the remainder is bounded by ε‖h‖^2 for all ‖h‖<δ.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be differentiable and H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Show that f(x+h) = f(x) + ∇f(x)·h + (1/2) h^T H_f(x) h + o(‖h‖^2) as h → 0 uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- Domain: ℝ^n; Lean: general finite-dimensional E — acceptable generalization.
- Regularity assumptions: NL says “f differentiable” and “H_f is continuous on U.” This usually means f has continuous second derivatives on U (i.e., f ∈ C^2(U)). Lean uses ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, which is the standard C^2 assumption. This is at least as strong as the NL hypothesis and arguably equivalent under standard interpretations, since talking about H_f being continuous presupposes second derivatives exist and are continuous.
- Openness: NL says “convex set U” but doesn’t explicitly assume U is open. Lean requires U to be open. This strengthens the hypothesis. In many analytic contexts, derivatives are defined on open sets; the NL phrasing could be informal and intended to mean open convex U, but as written it does not say open.
- Uniformity on compact subsets: Lean formalizes the uniform little-o via: for every compact K ⊆ U and ε>0, ∃δ>0 such that the remainder bound holds for all x ∈ K and all small h. This matches the uniform small-o requirement.
- Expression of the expansion: Lean’s formula uses fderiv and the second derivative applied bilinearly; this matches ∇f and the Hessian term.
- Additional detail: Lean includes “x + h ∈ U” as a guaranteed consequence (ensuring we stay in the domain where the C^2 structure is assumed), which is reasonable and compatible with the intended usage and uniformity. The NL statement doesn’t state this explicitly, but since h → 0 uniformly on compact K ⊆ U, such a property is typically ensured by choosing δ small.

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- The conclusions match: a second-order Taylor expansion with o(‖h‖^2) remainder, uniform on compacts in U.
- Differences in hypotheses:
  - Lean requires U to be open; NL only says convex. This is a strengthening and thus a mismatch under a harsh reading.
  - Lean assumes ContDiffOn 2 (C^2) on U; NL phrases as “f differentiable and H_f continuous on U”. While standardly equivalent in meaning to C^2, the Lean hypothesis is more explicit and arguably stronger/formally different. Under a strict reading, this is an acceptable restatement only if we interpret the NL as “f has continuous second derivative on U”. If not, it is a strengthening.
- Other aspects (finite-dimensional generalization, use of fderiv/Hessian encoding, uniform small-o quantification) are faithful.

Verdict: Almost faithful, but with a stricter hypothesis (U open, C^2 stated via ContDiffOn) than the NL text explicitly states. Under the auditor’s extra-harsh standard, this counts as not fully faithful.

The Lean theorem matches the logical content:
- S ⊆ ℝ: represented by S : Set ℝ.
- c cluster point of S: encoded as c ∈ closure (S \ {c}), which is equivalent in ℝ.
- Limits “as x → c within S”: expressed via Tendsto … (nhdsWithin c S) (nhds …).
- Conclusion: a · f(x) → a · L within S.
- The presence of g and its limit is included as in the hypothesis (though unnecessary for the conclusion), which aligns with the original statement’s inclusion of g and M.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- Domain of f, g: The original states f, g : S → ℝ; the Lean code uses f, g : ℝ → ℝ with limits along nhdsWithin c S. This is a mild formal difference: nhdsWithin only depends on values on S, so it faithfully captures the intended notion of limits of functions defined on S. The Lean statement is slightly more general (it allows any extension to ℝ), but it does not change the mathematical meaning of the claim about limits along S.
- Extra assumption: Including g and its limit is superfluous for the conclusion, but the original hypothesis also mentions g and M; so this is consistent rather than misleading.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. Overall, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with the only minor deviation being the ambient domain of f and g, which is standard in Mathlib when using nhdsWithin.

  This states: If U is convex, and the Fréchet derivative fderiv of f is continuous on U, and at each x ∈ U the corresponding linear functional L = fderiv ℝ f x satisfies the operator norm bound |L v| ≤ M‖v‖ for all v, then for all x, y ∈ U, the first-order Taylor remainder |f(y) − f(x) − (fderiv ℝ f x)(y − x)| is bounded by M‖y − x‖. No proof is provided (sorry), but we only audit the statement.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL states: f : ℝ^n → ℝ has continuous partial derivatives on a convex set U. If ‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M for all x ∈ U, then |f(y) − f(x) − ∇f(x)·(y − x)| ≤ M‖y − x‖.
- Code uses: (Fin n → ℝ) as the domain with its default norm, and uses the Fréchet derivative fderiv rather than the gradient/dot product. The assumption hbound is that the operator norm of fderiv at x is ≤ M, expressed by ∀ v, |(fderiv x) v| ≤ M‖v‖. The conclusion bound uses the same derivative applied to (y − x).

3) Differences/mismatches:
- Norm/geometry mismatch: The NL statement is in Euclidean ℝ^n with the standard inner product, gradient, and Euclidean norm. The Lean code works in (Fin n → ℝ) with the default Pi/sup norm (unless one explicitly uses EuclideanSpace). Under the sup norm, the operator norm bound corresponds to the ℓ1-norm of the gradient (dual to sup), not the Euclidean ℓ2 norm. Thus the assumption ‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M (Euclidean) in the NL is not the same as ∀ v, |(fderiv x) v| ≤ M‖v‖ under the default norm in the code. This is a substantive mismatch.
- Representation of gradient vs derivative: In Euclidean space, fderiv at x is the linear functional v ↦ ∇f(x) · v, so using fderiv is an acceptable formalization. However, because the code does not specify the Euclidean inner product structure, the identification with the dot product and Euclidean norms is not ensured.
- Regularity assumptions: NL assumes “continuous partial derivatives”; the code assumes “ContinuousOn fderiv” (continuity of the Fréchet derivative). In finite dimensions on open sets, continuous partials imply C^1 and continuity of fderiv. But U is only assumed convex (not necessarily open), and the code’s assumption is strictly stronger than stated. This is acceptable as a strengthening, but it is not a faithful equivalence of hypotheses.
- Inequality form: Both NL and code state the same inequality form with the first-order expansion around x, so structurally they match there.

Final check: Because of the norm/inner-product mismatch and the stronger/shifted differentiability hypothesis (continuous fderiv rather than continuous partials, and in a space with potentially different norm), the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the original Euclidean statement. It is a related generalization in an arbitrary normed space and so can yield a different constant M due to norm differences. Therefore, it fails the strict faithfulness test.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Definition integral_op: Given k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ, f : ℝ → ℝ, and y : ℝ, define integral_op k f y = ∫ over ℝ (Lebesgue measure) of k(x, y) * f(x) dx. This integrates over the entire real line ℝ using the volume (Lebesgue) measure, without restricting x to [0,1]. The domain of f is ℝ → ℝ, and y ranges over all ℝ.
- Theorem integral_op_maps_continuous: If k is continuous on ℝ × ℝ, then for any continuous f : ℝ → ℝ, the map y ↦ integral_op k f y is continuous (as a function ℝ → ℝ). This asserts continuity in y on the whole real line.
- Theorem integral_op_linear: If k is continuous on ℝ × ℝ, then for all f, g : ℝ → ℝ and scalars a, b : ℝ, the function y ↦ integral_op k (fun x => a * f x + b * g x) y equals y ↦ a * integral_op k f y + b * integral_op k g y, i.e., pointwise linearity of the integral operator on functions defined on ℝ, with the integral taken over ℝ.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Original statement specifics:
  - k : [0,1]^2 → ℝ is continuous (domain restricted to the unit square).
  - L maps C([0,1], ℝ) → C([0,1], ℝ), i.e., continuous functions on [0,1] to continuous functions on [0,1]. The variable y is in [0,1].
  - Lf(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x, y) f(x) dx (integral over x ∈ [0,1]).
  - Tasks: (i) show Lf is continuous on [0,1] whenever f is continuous on [0,1] (well-definedness), (ii) show L is linear.
- Mismatches in the Lean code:
  - Integration domain: The code integrates over ℝ, not over [0,1]. There is no restriction or indicator for [0,1].
  - Domains/codomains of functions: The code takes f : ℝ → ℝ and produces functions ℝ → ℝ, whereas the statement uses f ∈ C([0,1], ℝ) and y ∈ [0,1]. No use of the subspace [0,1] or of ContinuousMap (C([0,1], ℝ)).
  - Kernel domain: The code uses k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ (continuous on all of ℝ × ℝ), not k defined on [0,1]^2.
  - Well-definedness: The code asserts continuity on ℝ for y ↦ ∫_ℝ k(x,y) f(x) dx under continuity assumptions only, which is a different statement (and, mathematically, requires integrability/dominance conditions not addressed). The original asks for continuity on [0,1] given continuity on [0,1].
  - Linearity: The code states pointwise linearity for all y ∈ ℝ with integrals over ℝ, not linearity of an operator L : C([0,1], ℝ) → C([0,1], ℝ) defined via ∫_0^1.
  - The docstring claims ∫_0^1 but the actual definition uses ∫ over ℝ, a direct contradiction within the code itself.

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
They are different. The Lean code does not model the operator on [0,1], does not restrict y to [0,1], does not use C([0,1], ℝ), and integrates over ℝ rather than [0,1]. It therefore fails to faithfully translate the natural language statement. There are no vacuous placeholder definitions, but the core mathematical setting is not the same.

Verdict: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib. Fine.
- Comment: `/-- Two outer measures on R^n: m_star and mu_star (definitions omitted). -/` This explicitly states the definitions are omitted. Red flag: the natural language statement crucially depends on the specific definitions of m* and μ*.
- `theorem mu_star_eq_m_star {n : ℕ} (m_star mu_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : mu_star S = m_star S := by sorry`
  Natural language translation: For any natural number n, for any two functions m_star and mu_star from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as `Fin n → ℝ`) to ℝ, and for any subset S of ℝ^n, we have mu_star(S) = m_star(S). Proof omitted (`sorry`).
  Observations:
  - `m_star` and `mu_star` are completely arbitrary functions; they are not defined as outer measures nor as the specific constructions in the problem. No constraints are placed (not even outer measure axioms).
  - The theorem statement claims equality for all choices of such functions and all S, which is far stronger (and generally false) than the intended statement.
  - The domain `(Fin n → ℝ)` is a reasonable model of ℝ^n, but nothing about open rectangles, coverings, countability, or volumes appears.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement defines m* as the outer measure via the infimum over countable coverings by open rectangles and μ* as the infimum over finite or countable coverings by open rectangles, and asks to prove μ*(S) = m*(S) for every S.
- The Lean code does not define m* or μ*, does not specify they are outer measures, does not mention rectangles, openness, countability, or volume, and instead universally quantifies over arbitrary set functions.
- Even the weak idea ""for every S"" is not encoded as a separate quantifier, but the curried form `(S) : ...` would correspond to `∀ S`. However, since `m_star` and `mu_star` are arbitrary, this is unrelated to the specific equality stemming from those constructions.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement asserts mu_star S = m_star S for any two arbitrary functions and any S, with no reference to the definitions in the problem. The NL statement asserts equality for two specific functionals defined via coverings by open rectangles. The code omits the essential definitions and constraints and thus is not a faithful translation.
- Additional red flags per guidelines:
  - Missing/placeholder definitions (explicitly omitted) for critical concepts.
  - No use of Mathlib's OuterMeasure or measurable structures.
  - No mention of open rectangles, countability, or volume.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Grade justification: Vacuous/omitted definitions; if those were correctly provided (i.e., m_star and mu_star defined as in the NL statement), the final statement `(S) : mu_star S = m_star S` would be faithful to ""for every S, μ*(S) = m*(S)"". Hence grade 6 per the rubric.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work on ℝ with the default (Lebesgue) measure from Mathlib.
- Statement name: convolution_well_defined
- Inputs:
  - f, g : ℝ → ℝ
  - a b : ℝ
  - hf : MeasureTheory.Integrable f — this means f is Lebesgue integrable: ∫ |f| dμ < ∞ and f is (a.e.) measurable.
  - hg_cont : Continuous g — g is continuous on ℝ.
  - hg_zero : ∀ t, t < a ∨ t > b → g t = 0 — g vanishes outside the closed interval [a, b] (i.e., for all t not in [a, b], g t = 0).
- Conclusion: ∀ x : ℝ, MeasureTheory.Integrable (fun t => f t * g (x - t)) — for every x, the function t ↦ f(t) * g(x − t) is Lebesgue integrable on ℝ. Equivalently, the integral ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt exists (as a Lebesgue integral), so the convolution at x is well-defined.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original hypotheses:
  - f is Riemann integrable with ∫_{−∞}^{∞} |f(x)| dx < ∞ (i.e., absolutely integrable improper Riemann integral over ℝ).
  - g is continuous and equals zero outside [a, b].
- Desired conclusion: For all x ∈ ℝ, the convolution (g * f)(x) := ∫_{−∞}^{∞} f(t) g(x − t) dt is well-defined.

Match/mismatch analysis:
- The Lean code assumes f is Lebesgue integrable (MeasureTheory.Integrable f). The natural language states f is (improper) Riemann integrable with finite absolute integral. These are not the same assumptions: Lebesgue integrable is a strictly more general hypothesis than Riemann integrable with absolutely convergent improper integral. The Lean theorem applies to a larger class of functions than the original statement specifies.
- For g: “continuous and zero outside [a, b]” matches the Lean assumptions (Continuous g and g t = 0 for t < a or t > b). This part is faithful.
- Conclusion: The Lean conclusion (integrability of t ↦ f t * g (x − t) for all x) captures the intended “the convolution integral is well-defined for all x.” This part matches.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement replaces “Riemann integrable with absolutely convergent improper integral” by “Lebesgue integrable.” This is a meaningful change of hypothesis (it generalizes the statement). Under the auditing guidelines (be extra harsh), this counts as not faithful, even though the conclusion is the same and the Lean version is stronger.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the only issue is the change of integrability notion for f.

Therefore the translation is almost correct but not faithful due to the integrability hypothesis mismatch.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We work in Mathlib with Metric and Set, and fix n : ℕ. We model ℝ^n as the type (Fin n → ℝ), which is standard in Mathlib for Euclidean n-space.
- The theorem states: Given U ⊆ ℝ^n (as (Fin n → ℝ)) which is convex, and a function F : ℝ^n → ℝ^n, assume:
  • For every x ∈ U, F is Fréchet differentiable at x with derivative fderiv ℝ F x (i.e., HasFDerivAt F (fderiv ℝ F x) x).
  • The map x ↦ fderiv ℝ F x is ContinuousOn U.
  Then for every compact set K with K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, we have
    ‖F (x + h) − F x − fderiv ℝ F x h‖ ≤ ε · ‖h‖.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- NL statement: Let F : ℝ^n → ℝ^n be differentiable; suppose DF exists and is continuous on a convex set U. Show that ‖F(x+h) − F(x) − DF(x)h‖ = o(‖h‖) uniformly on compact subsets of U as h → 0.
- Correspondence of hypotheses:
  • F : ℝ^n → ℝ^n matches.
  • “Be differentiable” in the NL typically means differentiable on the domain of interest; the Lean code assumes HasFDerivAt for all x ∈ U, which is sufficient for the result on K ⊆ U. The Lean assumption is slightly weaker than “differentiable everywhere,” but that does not harm the conclusion about compact subsets of U.
  • DF continuous on U is expressed as ContinuousOn (x ↦ fderiv ℝ F x) U.
  • U convex is assumed (hU : Convex ℝ U), matching the NL.
- Correspondence of the conclusion:
  • “= o(‖h‖) uniformly on compact subsets of U as h → 0” is the standard epsilon–delta uniform formulation: For each compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and ‖h‖ < δ, the remainder norm is ≤ ε‖h‖. This is exactly what the Lean statement gives, except it includes the guard “x + h ∈ U”. This guard ensures the segment from x to x + h stays in U (using convexity) for the mean value/integral argument. In many classical statements, U is assumed open so the guard becomes automatic for small h on compact K ⊆ U; here U need not be open, and the Lean statement prudently restricts to those small h that keep the endpoint in U. This aligns with the intended meaning of “on compact subsets of U,” where one typically regards small increments that stay in the domain of control for DF.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Representation of ℝ^n as (Fin n → ℝ) is standard and acceptable; norms are equivalent in finite dimensions, so the little-o property is unaffected.
- The Lean theorem requires differentiability only on U (not all of ℝ^n), which is a weaker hypothesis than the NL’s likely intent, but it still implies the desired conclusion on compact subsets of U. This does not harm faithfulness of the translation.
- The condition “x + h ∈ U” is an explicit guard not mentioned in the NL. It is a natural and essentially implicit restriction in such statements (to ensure the path lies in U where DF is continuous), especially when U is not assumed open. If U were open or K ⊆ interior(U), this guard is redundant for small h. Hence, this is a harmless and arguably more precise formalization rather than a substantive deviation.
- No vacuous placeholders or non-mathlib definitions are used; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions: HasFDerivAt, fderiv, ContinuousOn, Convex, IsCompact, and the uniform ε-δ formulation of little-o.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim. The only minor stylistic difference is the explicit requirement x + h ∈ U, which is standard and consistent with the intended meaning. Therefore, it passes.

  ‖A‖ = max{‖A x‖ : ‖x‖ = 1} = sup{‖A x‖ : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} = sup{‖A x‖ : ‖x‖ < 1}, noting the unit sphere is compact in finite dimensions (so the max is attained).
- The Lean theorem generalizes from ℝ^n, ℝ^m to arbitrary finite-dimensional real normed space E and any normed space F; this is a harmless and standard generalization.
- The Lean theorem asserts equalities to suprema over the sphere, closed ball, and open ball. This matches the last two equalities in the NL statement and the sphere equality as a supremum.
- However, the NL statement explicitly uses “max” on the unit sphere, asserting that the supremum is attained (i.e., there exists x with ‖x‖=1 such that ‖A‖ = ‖A x‖). The Lean statement only asserts equality to the supremum over the sphere, not the existence of a maximizer.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The core equalities as suprema are present and correct in the Lean code.
- The NL statement contains strictly more information (attainment of the supremum on the unit sphere). The Lean code does not state this attainment; thus it is strictly weaker with respect to the first equality.
- Therefore, the Lean code is not fully faithful to the NL statement, though it is very close.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholders (aside from the omitted proof, which is allowed in this audit). Concepts are properly formalized in Mathlib terms. The only discrepancy is the missing “max” (attainment) on the unit sphere. Hence, almost faithful but not exactly: 9/10.

- The NL statement has two parts: (a) for nonconstant complex polynomials; (b) more generally, for nonconstant power series converging on the disk |z − z0| < ε. In both cases, assuming p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w in the ε-disk with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- The Lean theorem exactly matches the polynomial part: ε > 0, p nonconstant polynomial, p(z0) ≠ 0, conclusion ∃ w with |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- However, the Lean code does not address the more general case of nonconstant power series converging in the disk. It only handles polynomials.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The Lean code formalizes only the polynomial case, which is a special case of the full natural language statement. The original explicitly includes the more general power series case. Therefore, the Lean theorem is strictly weaker than the NL statement and is not a fully faithful translation.
- No other discrepancies: the neighborhood/disk condition and the nonvanishing at z0 are matched for polynomials; the use of natDegree ≠ 0 is a standard way to encode nonconstancy for polynomials in Mathlib.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code statements.
- Context: n is a finite index type with decidable equality; R is a commutative ring. Matrices are over R.
- Theorem matrix_adjugate_mul (A : Matrix n n R): A * Matrix.adjugate A = Matrix.det A • 1. Natural language: For any square matrix A over a commutative ring, A times its adjugate equals det(A) times the identity matrix.
- Theorem adjugate_transpose_inverse_of_det_unit {A} (h : IsUnit (Matrix.det A)): ((det A)^{-1} • (adj A)^T) * A^T = 1 and A^T * ((det A)^{-1} • (adj A)^T) = 1. Natural language: If det(A) is a unit, then (A^T)^{-1} = (det A)^{-1} (adj A)^T, i.e., the inverse of A^T equals the scalar inverse of det(A) times the transpose of the adjugate; equivalently, the cofactor matrix B satisfies (A^T)^{-1} = (1/det A) B.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL Part 1: ""Show that ASA^T is a diagonal matrix, where S has entries S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j}."" The code does not mention S at all and does not prove anything about A S A^T. Instead, it proves A adj(A) = det(A) I. Since adj(A) = (cofactor matrix)^T, the code implies A B^T = det(A) I, which is diagonal (indeed a scalar multiple of identity). However, this is a different matrix product from A S A^T. The statement about ASA^T being diagonal is not captured by the code. There is no definition or use of S.
- NL Part 2: ""If A is invertible then (A^T)^{-1} = (1/det A) B."" The second theorem matches this up to a mild hypothesis difference: the code assumes det(A) is a unit (IsUnit (det A)), which is a standard ring-theoretic hypothesis guaranteeing the formula; it implies the desired conclusion, and when A is invertible this hypothesis holds. The expression uses (adj A)^T, which is the cofactor matrix B, so it matches the stated formula. So Part 2 is faithfully captured (indeed slightly stronger than stated).

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- The second part aligns well with the Lean statement.
- The first part does not: the Lean code proves A adj(A) = det(A) I (hence AB^T is diagonal), whereas the NL asks about A S A^T with S_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}. These are different matrices; there is no S in the code. Therefore the overall translation is not faithful to the original two-part problem.

Grade rationale: No vacuous definitions; uses proper Mathlib concepts. However, a key component (the ASA^T diagonal claim) is entirely missing and replaced by a different, albeit related, identity. The second part is faithful. Given the instructions to be extra harsh, this warrants a mid-low score.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment
- import Mathlib: Using Mathlib.
- variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [MetricSpace X]: We fix a type X with two instances: a TopologicalSpace on X and a MetricSpace on X. Important: these are given independently; there is no assertion that the topology equals the one induced by the metric.
- abbrev Cb := BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ: Cb is the type of bounded continuous functions from X to ℝ, where continuity is with respect to the TopologicalSpace instance on X (the one explicitly provided), and boundedness is in ℝ.
- theorem cb_metric_space : MetricSpace Cb := by sorry: States that Cb carries a metric space structure. It does not explicitly state the metric d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x)−g(x)|, but Mathlib’s canonical metric on BoundedContinuousFunction is indeed the sup metric, so this is plausibly intended. However, the statement as written merely asserts “there exists a metric space structure,” not that it coincides with the explicitly defined metric in the problem.
- theorem tendsto_iff_uniform (u : ℕ → Cb) (f : Cb) : Tendsto u atTop (𝓝 f) ↔ (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : X, |u n x - f x| < ε) := by sorry: This asserts that sequential convergence in the metric/topology on Cb is equivalent to the ε–N uniform convergence condition. This matches the usual uniform convergence criterion via the sup norm since “∀ x, |u n x − f x| < ε” is equivalent to sup_x |u n x − f x| ≤ ε.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement
- Original: Let (X,d) be a metric space. Let C_b(X,ℝ) be bounded continuous functions X→ℝ with metric d(f,g)=sup_x |f(x)−g(x)|. Show that (C_b(X,ℝ),d) is a metric space and that convergence in d is equivalent to uniform convergence.
- Code issues:
  - The code assumes both [TopologicalSpace X] and [MetricSpace X] as independent instances. The natural language statement intends the topology on X to be the one induced by the metric d. In Lean, if you only assume [MetricSpace X], the induced TopologicalSpace is canonical. Here, introducing an arbitrary [TopologicalSpace X] without asserting it is the one induced by [MetricSpace X] means Cb is formed using possibly the wrong topology (not necessarily the metric topology). This is a significant mismatch with the NL statement which explicitly uses the metric topology.
  - The first theorem only asserts “MetricSpace Cb” without identifying the specific metric as sup_x |f−g|. While Mathlib’s instance is indeed the sup metric for BoundedContinuousFunction, the statement itself doesn’t tie to the explicit d in the problem. This is weaker than the NL statement, which defines a specific metric.
  - The second theorem correctly captures equivalence between convergence in the Cb metric topology and uniform convergence for sequences, phrased in the ε–N form.

3) Final comparison: same or different?
- Because the code allows an arbitrary TopologicalSpace X unrelated to the metric’s topology, the Cb being used in theorems could be the space of functions continuous w.r.t. an arbitrary topology, not the one induced by d. The NL statement uses continuity w.r.t. the metric topology from d. This discrepancy means the mathematical content does not necessarily match.
- The lack of explicit identification of the metric on Cb with d(f,g)=sup_x |f−g| in the theorem statement is also a gap, though Mathlib’s canonical instance likely matches the intent.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the independent TopologicalSpace assumption on X that is not tied to the metric’s topology, which changes the meaning of C_b(X,ℝ). With that fixed (i.e., drop [TopologicalSpace X] and keep only [MetricSpace X], or assert equality with the induced topology), the statements would be faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language and assess it.
- Context: R is a commutative ring. n is a finite type with decidable equality, serving as the index set for rows and columns. A matrix A : Matrix n n R is an n-by-n matrix over R.

- swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix n n R := (Matrix.reindex (Equiv.refl n) (Equiv.swap j k)).toFun A
  Translation: Define the matrix obtained from A by swapping its columns j and k. This uses Matrix.reindex to permute the column index by the transposition Equiv.swap j k, while keeping the row index unchanged (Equiv.refl). Since swap is an involution, this is exactly column-swapping.

- swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) (i j : n) : Matrix n n R := (Matrix.reindex (Equiv.swap i j) (Equiv.refl n)).toFun A
  Translation: Define the matrix obtained from A by swapping its rows i and j. This uses Matrix.reindex to permute the row index by the transposition Equiv.swap i j, while keeping the column index unchanged.

- det_swap_cols {A} {j k} (hj : j ≠ k) : Matrix.det (swap_cols A j k) = - Matrix.det A
  Translation: If j ≠ k, then swapping distinct columns j and k changes the determinant by a sign: det(A with columns j and k swapped) = − det(A). This matches the standard determinant property.

- det_swap_rows {A} {i j} (hi : i ≠ j) : Matrix.det (swap_rows A i j) = - Matrix.det A
  Translation: If i ≠ j, then swapping distinct rows i and j changes the determinant by a sign: det(A with rows i and j swapped) = − det(A). Also a standard property.

- det_eq_zero_of_row_eq {A} {i j} (hi : i ≠ j) (h : Matrix.row A i = Matrix.row A j) : Matrix.det A = 0
  Translation: If two distinct rows of A are equal, then det(A) = 0.

- det_eq_zero_of_col_eq {A} {i j} (hi : i ≠ j) (h : Matrix.col A i = Matrix.col A j) : Matrix.det A = 0
  Translation: If two distinct columns of A are equal, then det(A) = 0.

All auxiliary definitions (swap_cols, swap_rows) are legitimate, using canonical Mathlib constructions (Matrix.reindex and Equiv.swap). No vacuous placeholders.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The NL statement asks to show: swapping columns j and k negates the determinant; similarly for rows; and having two equal rows or columns forces determinant zero; explicitly without using Laplace expansion (a proof constraint not representable in the statement itself).
- The Lean theorems exactly state these properties: sign change under column/row swap (with the implicit assumption that j ≠ k), and determinant zero under equal distinct rows/columns.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing: NL uses numeric indices 1..n; Lean uses a finite type n with decidable equality and finitely many elements. This is standard and equivalent.
- Distinctness: The Lean statements require j ≠ k (or i ≠ j) explicitly, which matches the intended meaning of ""switching column j and k"" (or rows), since swapping identical indices would produce no change and hence not negate determinant. The NL statement implicitly assumes distinctness. No mismatch.
- Proof method constraint: The NL requests not to use Laplace formula; the Lean code only states the theorems (with sorry), so this constraint cannot be encoded, but it does not affect the faithfulness of the statement translation.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the mathematical statements, using appropriate Mathlib notions and non-vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- The theorem introduces real numbers a, b and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- It then introduces an arbitrary type Partition, and arbitrary functions upper_sum : Partition → (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ, lower_sum : Partition → (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ, a predicate RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop, and a function integral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ.
- Hypothesis h_bounded asserts f is bounded on [a,b]: ∃ M, ∀ x with a ≤ x ≤ b, |f x| ≤ M.
- P : ℕ → Partition is a sequence of partitions (but of what? This is not specified; it’s just a sequence in the arbitrary type Partition).
- h_diff_to_zero asserts that |upper_sum (P k) f − lower_sum (P k) f| → 0 as k → ∞.
- Conclusion: RiemannIntegrableOn f a b holds, and both sequences upper_sum (P k) f and lower_sum (P k) f converge to integral f a b.

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful?
- Major issue: The core mathematical notions are not Mathlib’s concepts nor are they defined; they are arbitrary parameters. Partition is an arbitrary type; upper_sum/lower_sum and integral are arbitrary functions unrelated to any standard definitions; RiemannIntegrableOn is an arbitrary predicate. There are no axioms tying these to partitions of [a,b], Darboux sums, or the Riemann integral.
- Because of this, the statement does not actually assert the intended classical theorem about Riemann integrability; it asserts a property for arbitrary, uninterpreted placeholders subject only to the given hypotheses. This is a critical mismatch.
- The code also does not ensure a ≤ b or that P k are partitions of [a,b].
- While the epsilon-N formulations correctly express convergence, they refer to an arbitrary integral function rather than the Riemann integral.
- Use of absolute value in the hypothesis |U − L| → 0 is fine in ℝ (equivalent to U − L → 0), but with the placeholders not constrained to be upper/lower sums, the semantic equivalence to the natural language claim is not ensured.

Step 3: Final comparison
- The natural language statement: For a bounded function on [a,b], if there exists a sequence of partitions of [a,b] with U(P_k,f) − L(P_k,f) → 0, then f is Riemann integrable and both U(P_k,f) and L(P_k,f) converge to the Riemann integral.
- The Lean code: Uses completely abstract placeholders for partitions, Darboux sums, the integrability predicate, and the integral, with no link to Mathlib’s notions. It does not guarantee that P_k partitions [a,b], nor that upper_sum/lower_sum correspond to upper/lower Darboux sums, nor that integral is the Riemann integral. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.
- Auxiliary constructs are essentially vacuous placeholders; they are not legitimate Mathlib definitions or faithful encodings.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If these placeholders were replaced with proper Mathlib definitions of partitions on [a,b], upper/lower Darboux sums, and a standard Riemann integrability predicate and integral, the statement would be faithful. As is, it fails the requirements.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line into natural language.
- Context: I : Set ℝ, f : ℝ → ℝ, c : ℝ, with hc : c ∈ I and h : DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f I c. This models a function defined on a subset I of ℝ, differentiable at c within I.

First theorem (exists_linear_approx):
- Statement: There exist real numbers a and b such that for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 with the property that for all x ∈ I, if |x - c| < δ then |a + b*(x - c) − f x| ≤ ε * |x - c|.
- This matches the first part of the natural language statement: existence of a, b giving a linear approximation with an error controlled by ε|x − c|, for x ∈ I near c.

Second theorem (exists_g):
- Statement: There exist a, b ∈ ℝ and g : ℝ → ℝ such that Tendsto g (nhds c) (nhds 0) (i.e., lim_{x→c} g(x) = 0 along the usual, unrestricted neighborhood filter in ℝ) and for all x ∈ I, |a + b*(x - c) − f x| = |x - c| * g x.
- Differences to note: g is a function ℝ → ℝ (not I → ℝ), the limit is with respect to nhds c (not nhdsWithin c I), and the equality is required for all x ∈ I (including possibly far from c and including x = c), not merely for x ∈ I near c.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- Original hypothesis: “f : I → ℝ is differentiable at c ∈ I.” Lean uses f : ℝ → ℝ with DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f I c and assumes c ∈ I, which is the standard mathlib formalization of differentiability of a function defined on a subset I. This is faithful.

- First conclusion: The Lean theorem exactly matches the form: ∃ a b, ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x ∈ I, |x − c| < δ → |a + b(x − c) − f(x)| ≤ ε|x − c|. This is faithful to the text.

- Second (equivalent) conclusion in the text: There exists g : I → ℝ with lim_{x→c, x∈I} g(x) = 0 and |a + b(x − c) − f(x)| = |x − c| g(x) for all x ∈ I near c. The Lean statement deviates in three ways:
  1) Domain of g: Lean uses g : ℝ → ℝ instead of g : I → ℝ. While one can often extend g, this is not the stated form.
  2) Limit filter: Lean requires Tendsto g (nhds c) (nhds 0), i.e., limit along the ambient nhds c, not the within-I limit nhdsWithin c I. This is strictly stronger unless I is a neighborhood of c, and does not match the subset-domain setting of the original statement.
  3) Where the equality holds: Lean requires the equality |a + b*(x − c) − f x| = |x − c| * g x for all x ∈ I, not merely for x near c. The original asserts the identity only near c. Requiring it globally is stronger and not an equivalent restatement of differentiability within I.

Step 3: Final check: Are they the same?
- The first theorem is faithful.
- The second theorem is not faithful due to the domain/limit filter mismatch and the global (not local) equality requirement. Therefore the overall translation does not match the original statement in full.

Grade rationale:
- Strong match on the first part, but the second part has multiple substantive mismatches. No vacuous definitions or placeholders; proofs are omitted which is acceptable. Given the two key issues (wrong filter and global vs local equality), the translation is not faithful. A reasonable grade reflecting substantial but partial correctness is 7.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- Docstring: States the intended theorem: if f is Fréchet differentiable at x0 with derivative f' (a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ), then for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all h with ‖h‖ < δ, the error |f(x0+h) − f(x0) − f'(h)| ≤ (‖f'‖ + ε)‖h‖. This is exactly the “operator norm times step plus arbitrarily small additive factor” formulation.
- Theorem signature: `theorem frechet_deriv_error_bound {E} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] {f : E → ℝ} {x0 : E} {f' : E →L[ℝ] ℝ} (hf : HasFDerivAt f f' x0) : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ h : E, ‖h‖ < δ → abs (f (x0 + h) - f x0 - f' h) ≤ (‖f'‖ + ε) * ‖h‖ := by sorry`.
  - This says: Let E be a real normed vector space. If f has Fréchet derivative f' at x0, then for every ε>0 there exists δ>0 such that for all h with ‖h‖<δ, the inequality holds. Here abs is the real absolute value and ‖f'‖ is the operator norm of f'.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: f : ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable at x0 ∈ ℝ^n. Show |f(x0+h) − f(x0) − Df(x0)h| ≤ ‖Df(x0)‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖) as h→0. This means the remainder is bounded by the operator norm times ‖h‖ plus a term of smaller order in ‖h‖. Equivalently: for every ε>0, for small h, |…| ≤ (‖Df(x0)‖ + ε)‖h‖.
- Lean statement is exactly this ε–δ formulation. It uses `HasFDerivAt f f' x0` for the derivative, with f' a continuous linear map, and the bound `(‖f'‖ + ε) * ‖h‖` for small h.
- The domain is generalized from ℝ^n to any real normed vector space E, which is a standard and acceptable strengthening; ℝ^n is a special case, so the translation remains faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain generalization: from ℝ^n to general E. This is a harmless generalization and still faithful to the original claim.
- Use of ε–δ versus o(‖h‖): These are equivalent formulations for this type of bound, so it matches the intended meaning “operator norm times the step plus a smaller-order term.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions (`HasFDerivAt`, `E →L[ℝ] ℝ`, operator norm), so this is proper.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language statement (indeed, in a slightly more general setting but equivalent in spirit and content).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open ...` are setup and do not affect the statement.
- `theorem isClosed_of_isCompact {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [T2Space X] {s : Set X} (hs : IsCompact s) : IsClosed s := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topological space structure and which is Hausdorff (T2), for any subset s of X, if s is compact then s is closed.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: ""In any Hausdorff space, every compact set is closed."" This is exactly the implication `IsCompact s → IsClosed s` under the hypothesis `[T2Space X]` for an arbitrary topological space X, universally quantified over s.
- The Lean code uses standard Mathlib notions: `TopologicalSpace X`, `T2Space X` (Hausdorff), `IsCompact`, and `IsClosed`. No placeholders or nonstandard definitions.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification over all Hausdorff spaces and all sets is present.
- The implication matches the exact mathematical content.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The presence of `sorry` in the proof does not affect the statement being translated; the task is about the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- import Mathlib: just imports the library.
- Theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_riemann_626 {a b : Real} {f : Real → Real} ...: States a theorem for real numbers a, b and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- (RiemannIntegrableOn : (Real → Real) → Real → Real → Prop): Introduces an arbitrary predicate symbol meant to represent “f is Riemann integrable on [a,b]”, but it is completely unconstrained (no definition or properties given).
- (Riemann_integral : (Real → Real) → Real → Real → Real): Introduces an arbitrary function symbol intended to denote the Riemann integral over [a,b], again with no definition/properties.
- (Riemann_sum : (Real → Real) → List Real → List Real → Real): Introduces an arbitrary function symbol intended to represent a Riemann sum from a partition list P and sample points cs; again unconstrained.
- (h_int : RiemannIntegrableOn f a b): Assumes the arbitrary predicate holds of f, a, b.
- {ε : Real} (hε : ε > 0): Given ε > 0.
- ∃ P : List Real, ∀ cs : List Real, cs.length = P.length.pred → abs (Riemann_integral f a b - Riemann_sum f P cs) < ε: Claims there exists a list P such that for all lists cs whose length is one less than the length of P, the absolute difference between the arbitrary “integral” and arbitrary “Riemann_sum” is < ε.
- by sorry: no proof; fine for the translation check, but it indicates the code relies on nothing substantive anyway.

Issues spotted in this translation:
- The three critical notions (integrability, integral value, Riemann sum) are not defined using Mathlib’s notions, nor are they given any axioms; they are completely arbitrary placeholders. This is a major red flag: the statement is effectively about arbitrary symbols rather than the actual mathematical concepts.
- P is just a List Real; there is no constraint that P is a partition of [a,b] (no a = x₀, b = xₙ, no monotonicity/sortedness, no nonempty, etc.).
- cs is just a List Real with a length condition; there is no constraint that each c_k ∈ [x_{k−1}, x_k].
- Riemann_sum is arbitrary; there is no guarantee it computes Σ f(c_k) Δx_k or even uses P and cs in any coherent way.
- f is declared on ℝ rather than [a,b]; that can be fine if one restricts, but here there is no restriction nor use of [a,b] beyond the parameters to the arbitrary symbols.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original requires: for Riemann integrable f on [a,b], and any ε > 0, there exists a partition P = {x₀,...,xₙ} of [a,b] such that for every choice of sample points c_k with c_k ∈ [x_{k−1}, x_k], the Riemann sum Σ f(c_k)Δx_k approximates the integral |∫_a^b f − Σ f(c_k)Δx_k| < ε.
- The Lean statement fails to enforce P being a partition of [a,b].
- It fails to enforce c_k ∈ corresponding subintervals.
- It fails to specify the Riemann sum as Σ f(c_k) Δx_k; instead it uses an arbitrary function Riemann_sum.
- It fails to use Mathlib’s actual Riemann integral notions; it uses arbitrary placeholders.
- Therefore, even if one replaced the placeholders by correct definitions, the statement would still be missing the critical constraints on P and cs; as written, it claims a stronger and different property (for all cs of matching length), and in the current form it’s almost content-free due to arbitrary symbols.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. Key structural requirements (partition of [a,b], sample points in subintervals, specific Riemann sum formula) are missing. The use of arbitrary, unconstrained placeholders for integrability, integral, and Riemann sum makes the statement not a faithful formalization of the original. It also does not use Mathlib’s established terminology/structures.

Given these discrepancies and vacuous placeholders, the translation is not faithful.

1) Translate the Lean code:
- The environment: We import Mathlib, open Filter, and work in a type α equipped with a ConditionallyCompleteLattice structure.
- Theorem liminf_le_liminf_of_le: For sequences x, y : ℕ → α, if x n ≤ y n for all n, then Filter.liminf x atTop ≤ Filter.liminf y atTop. This is the order-theoretic liminf inequality along the filter atTop (n → ∞).
- Theorem limsup_le_limsup_of_le: Similarly, with the same assumption, Filter.limsup x atTop ≤ Filter.limsup y atTop.
No proofs are provided (sorry), which is acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Suppose {x_n} converges and x_n ≤ y_n for all n. Show that liminf x ≤ liminf y and limsup x ≤ limsup y.
- The code asserts the two inequalities under the pointwise inequality x ≤ y for all n, but does not assume convergence of x. It also works over a general conditionally complete lattice α rather than, say, ℝ. The conclusions (inequalities of liminf/limsup) exactly match the NL conclusions.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Difference 1: The NL statement includes an extra hypothesis “x_n converges,” which the code omits. The inequalities are true without convergence, so the code states a stronger result. However, as a translation, it does not faithfully include the stated hypothesis.
- Difference 2: The code generalizes from real sequences to sequences in any conditionally complete lattice. This is a benign generalization, but it is not literally the same statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The Mathlib terms (Filter.liminf/limsup atTop) are appropriate.

Conclusion: The code presents a strictly stronger theorem than the NL statement and omits the explicit convergence hypothesis. Under the strict audit criteria, this is not a faithful translation of the exact statement, though it is very close in mathematical content and actually stronger.

",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for real numbers a, b and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- Assumption hbounded: there exists M such that for all x in Icc a b, |f x| ≤ M. This means f is bounded on the closed interval [a, b].
- Sequences a_n, b_n : ℕ → ℝ.
- h_an_lt: ∀ n, a < a_n n, and h_bn_lt: ∀ n, b_n n < b. So each a_n lies strictly to the right of a, and each b_n lies strictly to the left of b. However, there is no assumption relating a_n and b_n to each other (e.g., a_n < b_n).
- h_an: Tendsto a_n atTop (nhds a), h_bn: Tendsto b_n atTop (nhds b). So a_n → a and b_n → b.
- h_int: ∀ n, IntervalIntegrable f volume (a_n n) (b_n n). That is, for each n, f is Lebesgue-integrable on the interval between a_n n and b_n n (in the Mathlib sense of IntervalIntegrable with respect to volume).
- Conclusion: IntervalIntegrable f volume a b ∧ Tendsto (fun n => intervalIntegral f (a_n n) (b_n n) volume) atTop (nhds (intervalIntegral f a b volume)). That is, f is Lebesgue-integrable on [a, b], and the interval integrals over [a_n, b_n] converge to the interval integral over [a, b].

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement is about Riemann integrability; the Lean theorem uses Lebesgue/measure-theoretic IntervalIntegrable and intervalIntegral with respect to volume. These are not the same notions in Mathlib; while Riemann integrable functions are Lebesgue integrable and the integrals agree, the statement in Lean is both assuming Lebesgue integrability on each [a_n, b_n] and concluding Lebesgue integrability on [a, b], not Riemann integrability. This is a substantial mismatch in concepts.
- The NL hypotheses include for all n: a < a_n < b_n < b and both limits. The Lean code only assumes a < a_n and b_n < b and the limits; it omits the crucial a_n < b_n condition. In Mathlib, IntervalIntegrable is symmetric in endpoints, and intervalIntegral handles orientation, so the Lean statement could cover cases where a_n ≥ b_n, which are not covered by the original statement that explicitly uses the subinterval [a_n, b_n]. This is another mismatch.
- The NL hypothesis assumes only “bounded f on [a, b] and Riemann integrable on each [a_n, b_n]”. The Lean hypothesis assumes boundedness on [a, b] and Lebesgue IntervalIntegrable on each (a_n, b_n); the latter is stronger than Riemann integrability and also different in formulation.
- The conclusion in NL gives Riemann integrability on [a, b] and equality of Riemann integrals with the limit of the Riemann integrals over [a_n, b_n]; the Lean conclusion gives Lebesgue integrability and convergence of Lebesgue interval integrals.
- Minor: the Lean statement does not enforce a ≤ b. The boundedness assumption over Icc a b is vacuous if a > b, allowing degenerate cases; the original statement implicitly concerns a genuine interval [a, b]. This is less critical but is another discrepancy.

Final check: The two problems are not the same. The Lean code states a measure-theoretic version (Lebesgue) with weaker positional assumptions on a_n, b_n (missing a_n < b_n), and stronger integrability assumptions (Lebesgue integrable on each [a_n, b_n]) and concludes a measure-theoretic result, not the Riemann version. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the original Riemann statement.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholder definitions; the theorem structure mirrors the intended limit-of-integrals along expanding intervals and includes boundedness and endpoint convergence. However, the switch from Riemann to Lebesgue, missing a_n < b_n, and conclusion mismatch are substantive. Thus, not faithful; score reflects that it’s close in spirit but not the same statement.

2) Fidelity assessment:
- The natural language statement says: ""Every proper map f : X → Y to a locally compact Hausdorff space Y is a closed map."" The Lean statement precisely asserts that given Y locally compact and Hausdorff and f proper, then f is a closed map. This matches exactly. The use of `[LocallyCompactSpace Y]` and `[T2Space Y]` encodes ""locally compact Hausdorff."" `IsProperMap f` is Mathlib's notion of a proper map, and `IsClosedMap f` means f sends closed sets to closed sets.

- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib classes and predicates are used.
- No extra assumptions on X are added; none are needed by the statement.
- The requirement that Y is locally compact and Hausdorff is correctly captured.

- The Lean statement asserts exactly that: norm(gradient f x) equals opNorm(fderiv ℝ f x). In Mathlib, opNorm is defined as the supremum over the unit ball, which for linear maps coincides with the supremum over the unit sphere; for maps into ℝ, ‖L v‖ is |L v|. Thus it captures the same quantity as in the natural language.
- The hypothesis h : HasFDerivAt ... matches the differentiability assumption at x0.
- The setting is more general (any real Hilbert space F, with completeness), but includes ℝ^n and does not change the meaning of the statement; it is a standard generalization.

3) Final check and differences:
- Differences: Generalization from ℝ^n to any complete real inner product space; this is acceptable and faithful. Using operator norm instead of an explicit supremum is standard and equivalent.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It imports Mathlib and states a theorem det_row_add.
- Context: n is a natural number, R is a commutative ring, i0 is a row index, and M, M1, M2 are n×n matrices over R.
- Hypotheses:
  • h_rows: For all i ≠ i0 and all columns j, M i j = M1 i j. So M and M1 agree on every row except possibly row i0.
  • h_rows': For all i ≠ i0 and all columns j, M1 i j = M2 i j. So M1 and M2 agree on every row except possibly row i0.
  • h_sum: For all columns j, M i0 j = M1 i0 j + M2 i0 j. So the i0-th row of M is the entrywise sum of the i0-th rows of M1 and M2.
- Conclusion: Matrix.det M = Matrix.det M1 + Matrix.det M2.
Interpretation: This is the additivity of the determinant in the i0-th row while the other rows are fixed (since M, M1, and M2 all agree off row i0). It asserts linearity in one row with respect to addition, but says nothing about scalar multiplication.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement first asserts a purely combinatorial inequality about sums of absolute values of terms in the determinant expansion constrained to a subset S of entries, under the condition that S always has two entries in the same row or two entries in the same column. Then it says: use this to prove that the determinant is multilinear in the rows (i.e., linear in each row separately while fixing the others).
- The provided Lean theorem does not mention subsets S, determinant term expansions, or absolute values. There is no inequality and no use of the combinatorial property.
- The Lean theorem states only additivity in one specified row (i0), with other rows fixed. This covers only the additivity part of linearity, and only for a single row at a time. It does not state homogeneity in that row (scaling by a scalar) and does not assert multilinearity (linearity in each row simultaneously). It also does not derive the result from the combinatorial inequality.
- The Lean theorem is over a general commutative ring R, whereas the NL statement invokes absolute values (implying a normed/ordered structure, typically R or C). The mismatch in ambient algebraic structure is significant for the first part.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- They are different. The Lean code omits entirely the combinatorial absolute-value inequality and does not encode the “use this to prove” aspect.
- It captures only one piece (additivity in one row) of the ultimate goal (multilinearity), and even that is only partial linearity (no homogeneity). Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Grade justification: No vacuous definitions are introduced, and the theorem does express a standard component (row-additivity) related to the second part of the NL statement. However, it misses the main combinatorial claim and the full multilinearity. Being harsh, this merits a low score.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code fixes normed real vector spaces E and F: [NormedAddCommGroup E], [NormedSpace ℝ E], similarly for F.
- L : E ≃L[ℝ] F is a continuous linear equivalence (i.e., an invertible bounded linear operator with bounded inverse between normed spaces over ℝ). This matches the intent “L is invertible and L^{-1} is bounded,” and also ensures L itself is bounded.
- A : E →L[ℝ] F is a bounded linear operator.
- Hypothesis h: ‖A − (L : E →L F)‖ < 1 / ‖L.symm‖. This is the perturbation smallness condition with an explicit choice δ = 1/‖L^{-1}‖.

Comparison to the natural language statement:

- Scalar field restriction: The Lean theorem is stated over ℝ only, while the natural language statement says “normed vector spaces” without specifying the field (often intended ℝ or ℂ). This is a specialization, not the most general form. Under the given strictness, this is a mismatch.
- The natural statement asserts ∃ δ > 0; the Lean code encodes a specific smallness condition ‖A − L‖ < 1/‖L^{-1}‖. This is acceptable (it implies existence with δ = 1/‖L^{-1}‖), though the code does not explicitly state “δ > 0,” it is implicit since 1/‖L^{-1}‖ > 0.
- The code works with bounded linear maps explicitly; the natural statement’s use of operator norm already implies boundedness, so this is consistent.

Final check:
- Apart from the restriction to real scalars, the theorem statement in Lean faithfully captures the mathematical meaning of the original statement, including the Neumann-series norm bound. Given the instruction to be extra harsh, the ℝ-only specialization means it is not fully faithful in generality.

- variable (IntegrableOn : ((Fin n → Real) → Real) → Set (Fin n → Real) → Prop): Introduces an arbitrary predicate IntegrableOn; not tied to Riemann integrability.
- variable (integralOn : ((Fin n → Real) → Real) → Set (Fin n → Real) → Real): Introduces an arbitrary integral functional on sets; not tied to Riemann integral.
- theorem riemann_integrable_on_union_of_adjacent_rectangles ... : States that, assuming R, R', R'' are rectangles (via IsRectangle), R = R' ∪ R'', the intersection R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle, and volume(R' ∩ R'') = 0, and f is IntegrableOn R' and R'', then f is IntegrableOn R and integralOn f R = integralOn f R' + integralOn f R''. The proof is omitted by sorry.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement is specifically about Riemann integrability on rectangles in ℝ^n, with the geometrical condition that R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle with one side of length 0 (hence volume zero). The conclusion is that f is Riemann integrable on R and the integral over R equals the sum of the integrals over R' and R''.
- In the Lean code, all core concepts (rectangle, volume, integrability, integral) are abstracted as arbitrary variables: IsRectangle, volume, IntegrableOn, and integralOn. They are not defined in terms of Mathlib’s notions (e.g., Box, Riemann integration, or any established measure/volume). This makes the statement a schema over arbitrary predicates/functions, not the specific theorem about Riemann integrability.
- The code does not enforce that IntegrableOn corresponds to Riemann integrability, nor that integralOn is the Riemann integral. Therefore, the theorem does not faithfully express the Riemann-specific content of the original statement.
- The condition “R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle with one side of length 0” is only partially captured: the code requires IsRectangle (R' ∩ R'') and volume (R' ∩ R'') = 0. While volume zero is implied by a side length zero, the code’s volume is arbitrary and not tied to the notion of side lengths or Lebesgue/box volume; moreover, no relation between IsRectangle and volume is imposed. Thus, the geometric meaning is not faithfully encoded.
- The function domain mismatch (f : ℝ^n → ℝ vs. f : R → ℝ) is acceptable since integrability over a set typically uses restriction. However, this is minor compared to the larger issue that none of the mathematical notions are tied to Mathlib’s Riemann integration.
- The theorem name mentions “riemann_integrable” but the content does not ensure Riemann integrability—only an arbitrary IntegrableOn.
- Finally, the theorem ends with sorry, but per the task we judge only the statement, not the proof. The main issue remains the use of uninterpreted placeholders instead of Mathlib definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean code does not faithfully translate the original statement; it replaces all key mathematical notions with arbitrary predicates/functions, so it is not the same math problem.

Grade rationale: The structure of the hypotheses and conclusion mimics the original (rectangles, union equals R, zero-volume intersection, additivity of integral on union), so if the placeholders were replaced with genuine Mathlib notions of rectangles, Riemann integrability, and integral, it would likely be faithful. However, as-is, it is not faithful. This corresponds to a grade of 6 per the rubric.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def LocallySimplyConnectedSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`
  This defines a predicate named ""LocallySimplyConnectedSpace"" for a topological space X, but sets it to be always true. This is a placeholder, not the actual notion of local simple connectedness.

- `def FinitelyGenerated (G : Type u) : Prop := True`
  This defines a predicate named ""FinitelyGenerated"" for a type G, but again sets it to always true. This is a placeholder and not the proper notion of a group being finitely generated. In Mathlib, the standard notion for a group is `Group.fg G`.

- `theorem compact_locally_simply_connected_fundamental_group_fg (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] (x : X) (h : LocallySimplyConnectedSpace X) : FinitelyGenerated (FundamentalGroup X x) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X with a topological space structure and compact space structure, and any basepoint x : X, if X is locally simply connected (according to the placeholder predicate), then the fundamental group of X at x is finitely generated (according to the placeholder predicate). The proof is omitted via `sorry`.

Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Show that every compact, locally simply connected topological space has finitely generated fundamental group.""
- Intended formalization: For all `X` with `[TopologicalSpace X]` and `[CompactSpace X]` and any basepoint `x : X`, if `X` is locally simply connected, then `Group.fg (FundamentalGroup X x)`.
- Issues:
  1. The predicate `LocallySimplyConnectedSpace` is a vacuous placeholder (`:= True`). This does not faithfully represent the intended topological property. Red flag per guidelines.
  2. The predicate `FinitelyGenerated` is also a vacuous placeholder (`:= True`) and does not refer to the group structure of `FundamentalGroup X x`. Mathlib has `Group.fg` for finitely generated groups; not using it is a red flag and makes the statement meaningless.
  3. The theorem ends with `by sorry`. While the instructions allow omitting proofs, the major problem is that the key predicates are vacuous, making the theorem trivially true and not a faithful translation.
  4. Use of latest Mathlib terms: The code does not use `Group.fg` and invents placeholders instead. Also, Mathlib may not have a built-in `LocallySimplyConnectedSpace` (it does have `SemilocallySimplyConnected`), but introducing it as `True` is unacceptable. A faithful translation would need a proper definition or a recognized Mathlib predicate.

Comparison and final check:
- The formal statement shape (compact space, locally simply connected, fundamental group at a basepoint is finitely generated) matches the natural language in spirit, including the basepoint convention. However, since both crucial notions are replaced by `True`, the Lean code does not actually state the intended mathematics.
- Therefore, the two problems are different: the Lean code asserts a triviality that holds for any compact space and any basepoint, regardless of local simple connectedness or group structure, because both predicates are true by definition.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib notions (`Group.fg (FundamentalGroup X x)` and a legitimate definition of locally simply connected), the theorem statement itself would be faithful. As-is, it fails the audit.

- def homeomorph_of_continuous_bijective_of_compact_t2 {X Y} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (hb : Bijective f) (hX : CompactSpace X) (hY : T2Space Y) : Homeomorph X Y := by sorry
  Natural language: Given types X, Y equipped with topologies, a function f : X → Y, hypotheses that f is continuous and bijective, X is compact, and Y is Hausdorff (T2), we define/produce a Homeomorph X Y. The proof term is omitted (sorry), but the type expresses that under these assumptions, there exists a specific homeomorphism between X and Y (it constructs one as data).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: A continuous bijection f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism.
This means specifically that the given function f has a continuous inverse, i.e., the homeomorphism produced should have forward map equal to f.
The Lean code returns a Homeomorph X Y, but critically it does not assert that its toFun equals f. Thus the code only states “there exists a homeomorphism between X and Y under these hypotheses,” not that f itself is that homeomorphism. This is strictly weaker than the intended statement and does not ensure f’s inverse is continuous.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Matching parts: Assumptions match exactly (continuity of f, bijective f, CompactSpace X, T2Space Y). Conclusion is about a homeomorphism between X and Y.
- Key mismatch: The produced Homeomorph is not tied to f. The original statement asserts “f is a homeomorphism,” not merely that there exists some homeomorphism. To be faithful, the type should be something like: {e : Homeomorph X Y // e.toEquiv.toFun = f} or a theorem concluding that the inverse of f is continuous, or a construction Homeomorph with toFun := f. As written, the code is weaker and thus not faithful.
- About the sorry: Although no proof is required, the presence of sorry is acceptable for the final theorem/definition body in this context, but it doesn’t cure the mismatch in the statement.

Conclusion: The translation is close in spirit but not faithful because it fails to assert that the homeomorphism realized is exactly f.

  Natural language translation: For topological spaces X and Y, with Y Hausdorff (T2) and locally compact, if f : X → Y is continuous, injective, and a closed map (sends closed sets to closed sets), then there is a homeomorphism between X and the subspace range f ⊆ Y (i.e., f is a homeomorphism onto its image).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space and f : X → Y a closed injection. Prove that f is a homeomorphism onto its image.
- The code includes the assumptions: Y is Hausdorff and locally compact (matches), f is injective and a closed map (matches), but it also assumes hf_cont : Continuous f, which is an extra hypothesis not present in the original statement.
- The conclusion Homeomorph X (range f) matches “homeomorphism onto its image”. Using range f is the standard way to formalize “image” with subspace topology.

Differences:
- The crucial difference is the extra continuity assumption in the code. The original statement does not assume continuity; the code requires it. This makes the Lean statement strictly stronger than the natural language claim and thus not a faithful translation.
- The additional Y assumptions [T2Space Y] and [LocallyCompactSpace Y] are consistent with “locally compact Hausdorff”; they are not a problem. The local compactness of Y may be superfluous for the usual theorem with continuity, but that does not harm faithfulness since it was also in the NL statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions are made; the only placeholder is the proof (sorry), which is acceptable per the task as we are only auditing the statement.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same: the Lean code assumes continuity, the NL statement does not. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  Natural language: For any types X and Y with topological spaces, assuming X is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`) and Y is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), for any function f : X → Y, if f is continuous (`Continuous f`), then f is a proper map (`IsProperMap f`).

- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement is provided.

- `theorem isConnected_of_contractible (Y : Type u) [TopologicalSpace Y] (h : ContractibleSpace Y) : ConnectedSpace Y := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type Y with a topological space structure, if Y is a contractible space, then Y is a connected space. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: ""Prove that every contractible space is connected and has trivial homotopy groups.""
- The Lean theorem only asserts: contractible => connected (ConnectedSpace Y). It does not mention homotopy groups at all.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the theorem is a single statement. While the first part (connectedness) aligns with part of the original statement, the crucial second part (trivial homotopy groups for all n) is completely missing.
- Additionally, Mathlib’s notion of ""homotopy groups"" typically involves pointed spaces; none of that appears in the statement. The Lean code does not attempt to formalize or reference homotopy groups in any way.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code translates only the ""connected"" part of the claim and omits the ""has trivial homotopy groups"" part. Therefore the translation is incomplete and not faithful.
- Minor red flags: `open CategoryTheory` is irrelevant, but not harmful. The docstring mentions the full claim, but the formal statement does not match it.

Conclusion: The translation fails because it omits a substantial part of the natural language statement (triviality of all homotopy groups).

- The docstring matches the formal statement: in a complete metric space, closed and totally bounded implies compact.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language statement: Let X be a metric space. If S ⊆ X is closed and bounded, then S is compact.
- Differences:
  1) Completeness: The Lean code assumes [CompleteSpace X]; the natural language statement does not. This is an additional hypothesis that changes the statement.
  2) Bounded vs Totally Bounded: The Lean code assumes TotallyBounded S, while the natural language statement assumes S is bounded. In general metric spaces, bounded does not imply totally bounded; these are distinct notions. The code’s assumption is stronger and different from the stated one.
- Conclusion: The Lean theorem asserts a different (standard and true) result than the one stated in natural language. It is not a faithful translation of the given statement.

Auxiliary definitions check:
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement with sorry for the proof. However, faithfulness fails due to the mismatched hypotheses.

Final check:

  • `CompactSpace X` is the Mathlib predicate that the whole space X is compact.

This is the standard Mathlib formalization of “every sequence has a convergent subsequence”.
  • The theorem uses `↔`, giving an if and only if.
  • No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that a metric space X is compact iff X is sequentially compact.”
- In Mathlib, `CompactSpace X` means X is compact as a whole space. Sequential compactness is expressed by the property that every sequence has a convergent subsequence; the Lean statement exactly encodes this via `∀ u, ∃ a s, StrictMono s ∧ Tendsto (u ∘ s) atTop (nhds a)`.
- The use of `StrictMono s` is the standard way to represent a subsequence in Lean.
- Convergence is expressed correctly via `Tendsto ... (nhds a)`.
- Therefore, the theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- Both directions (iff) are present.
- The setting is a metric space in both statements.
- Sequential compactness is captured exactly as “every sequence has a convergent subsequence”.
- No extraneous hypotheses or missing conditions.
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions.

  Natural language reading: Given topological spaces X and Y, a function f : X → Y that is continuous and bijective, with X compact and Y Hausdorff, we define/produce a homeomorphism between X and Y. The proof/body is omitted (sorry), but for translation auditing we only care about the statement type.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement says: A continuous bijection f from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism. This means specifically that the given function f itself is a homeomorphism: there exists a Homeomorph X Y whose underlying function equals f (equivalently, f has a continuous inverse and so determines a homeomorphism structure).
- The Lean definition returns a Homeomorph X Y from the data (f, hf, hb, hX, hY), but crucially it does not state that the underlying function of the produced homeomorphism is f. The result type is just Homeomorph X Y, with no equation like H.toFun = f or H.toContinuousMap = ⟨f, hf⟩. Thus, the code asserts only that under these hypotheses, there exists some homeomorphism between X and Y, not that f is that homeomorphism.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful: it loses the essential identification that “f is a homeomorphism.”

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Original: f itself is a homeomorphism (i.e., there exists H : Homeomorph X Y with H.toFun = f, or equivalently H.toContinuousMap = ⟨f, hf⟩).
- Code: Produces some Homeomorph X Y from the hypotheses, without tying it to f.
- Difference: Missing the equality between the produced homeomorphism’s toFun and the given f. This is a substantive mismatch.

Notes:
- There are no extraneous/vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only issue is the mismatch in the statement. The use of T2Space for Hausdorff and CompactSpace for compact is standard Mathlib terminology.
- A faithful version would ensure the result’s toFun is f, e.g., by returning ∃ H : Homeomorph X Y, H.toContinuousMap = ⟨f, hf⟩, or directly constructing H with toFun := f (and then showing continuous_invFun using the compact/Hausdorff hypotheses), or giving a lemma whose conclusion is IsClosedMap/... leading to Homeomorph with toFun = f.

Given this key mismatch, the translation is not faithful.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Setup, no mathematical content.
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We fix a topological space X.
- The theorem `closed_subset_of_compact (s : Set X) (hs : IsClosed s) (hcomp : IsCompact (univ : Set X)) : IsCompact s` reads: For a set s in a topological space X, if s is closed in X and the whole space X (i.e., univ) is compact, then s is compact.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that a closed subset of a compact space is compact."" This means: if X is a compact topological space and s ⊆ X is closed, then s is compact (as a subspace or equivalently compact as a subset in the ambient space). 
- In Mathlib, `IsCompact (univ : Set X)` is equivalent to saying X is a compact space. `IsClosed s` matches s being closed in X. `IsCompact s` is the standard notion of compactness for subsets in the ambient space, equivalent to compactness of the subspace topology. 
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The statement uses standard Mathlib predicates and is precisely the intended theorem. 

Final check:
- The Lean statement is mathematically the same as the natural language statement. No discrepancies found.

  Translation: For any types X and Y equipped with topological structures, if f : X → Y is continuous (hf) and X is a compact space (hX), then f is a closed map (it sends closed sets to closed sets), expressed as `IsClosedMap f`. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is allowed for the purpose of translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: If X is compact and f : X → Y is continuous, then f is closed. In Mathlib terms, ""X is compact"" is `CompactSpace X`, ""f is continuous"" is `Continuous f`, and ""f is closed"" is `IsClosedMap f`. The Lean statement matches this exactly.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.
- Standard Mathlib notions are used appropriately.
- Note: In general topology, the truth of this theorem usually requires Y to be Hausdorff; however, the natural language statement did not include this assumption, and the Lean statement also omits it. Since we are judging translation fidelity (not correctness), this is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

- The theorem declaration: `theorem compactSpace_prod_iff {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : CompactSpace (X × Y) ↔ CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y := by sorry`
  Natural language: For types X and Y with topologies, the product space X × Y is compact if and only if X and Y are both compact. Here `CompactSpace α` is Mathlib’s standard notion that α is compact as a space (equivalently, `IsCompact (Set.univ)`). The product `X × Y` has the standard product topology induced by the instances on X and Y.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement asks: If X and Y are topological spaces, prove that X × Y is compact iff X and Y are both compact.
- The Lean statement exactly asserts: `CompactSpace (X × Y) ↔ (CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y)`. This is precisely the formalization of the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of Mathlib’s `CompactSpace` is the appropriate, standard notion. The absence of a proof (`sorry`) does not affect faithfulness of the statement itself.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: ""Topological spaces X and Y are both compact just when their product is compact."" The Lean statement precisely captures this as an iff between the conjunction of `CompactSpace X` and `CompactSpace Y` and `CompactSpace (X × Y)`. This matches the intended meaning of ""just when"" as iff. The product topology on `X × Y` is the canonical one given the instances. No extra assumptions (like Hausdorff or nonemptiness) are made, matching the general statement.

3) Final check:
- Concepts align: compactness via `CompactSpace`, product space via `X × Y` with product topology.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just a theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable per instructions.
- No discrepancies in scope or conditions.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This asserts (by providing a definition) a homeomorphism between the one-point compactification of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (i.e., R^n) and the unit sphere in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1))` (i.e., S^n as the set `{x | ‖x‖ = 1}` with the subspace topology). The body is `sorry`, meaning the proof/construction is omitted, but the statement itself is clear and precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement claims: the one-point compactification of R^n is homeomorphic to S^n.
- The Lean statement exactly provides a `Homeomorph` between `OnePoint (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))` and the unit sphere `{x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1)) | ‖x‖ = 1}`. This matches the standard interpretation of S^n as the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1} with its subspace topology.
- It is even slightly stronger in format (it gives a homeomorphism object rather than an existential statement), which is acceptable and faithful to the original claim.
- Edge case n = 0 is handled correctly: OnePoint of a point is a two-point compact Hausdorff space, homeomorphic to S^0 = {−1, 1} ⊂ ℝ, so the statement remains valid for all n ≥ 0.

3) Final check for differences or red flags:
- No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- All Mathlib concepts used are standard and correct: `OnePoint`, `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, and the sphere as the subtype `{x | ‖x‖ = 1}`.
- The theorem/def statement is exactly the mathematical content of the NL statement.
- The omission of the proof via `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing, since we only check the statement's faithfulness, not its proof.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: For a metric space X, if X is sequentially compact, then every open cover of X has a finite subcover.
- In Mathlib, CompactSpace X means that the whole space X is compact (isCompact_univ), which is equivalent to the Heine–Borel open-cover definition: every open cover of X has a finite subcover. Thus, the theorem's conclusion CompactSpace X exactly matches the intended conclusion in standard topological terms.
- The definition of SequentiallyCompact X given matches the usual metric-space definition (every sequence has a convergent subsequence in X). No placeholders or vacuous definitions are used.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The Lean code asserts exactly the metric-space result that sequential compactness implies compactness (i.e., open-cover compactness). This is logically equivalent to the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X]`: Work with a type X equipped with a topology.
- `def is_simply_connected (U : Set X) : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate meaning “U is simply connected,” but it is defined as True for all U. This is vacuous and does not capture the intended mathematical notion.
- `def has_countable_basis_of_simply_connected_open_sets (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`: Another placeholder, asserting X has a countable basis of simply connected open sets, but defined as True for all X. Vacuous; it does not reference bases, openness, or simply connectedness.
- `def is_path_connected_space (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`: Placeholder for path connectedness, again vacuously True.
- `def fundamental_group (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] (x0 : X) : Type := PUnit`: Defines the fundamental group type at basepoint x0 to be PUnit (a one-element type), which is not the actual fundamental group. This is a non-faithful stand-in and forces triviality.
- Theorem `fundamental_group_countable_of_countable_basis_simply_connected`: Statement: If X is path connected and has a countable basis of simply connected open sets, then the “fundamental group” at x0 is countable. However, since the hypotheses are vacuous (always true) and the “fundamental group” is defined to be PUnit, the conclusion is trivially true and unrelated to the real mathematical content. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

Step 2: Does the whole Lean statement faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language claim: If X is a path connected topological space with a countable basis of simply connected open sets, then π1(X) is countable.
- The Lean version uses placeholders: path connectedness and the basis condition are both defined as True, and the fundamental group is replaced by PUnit. Thus, the statement does not capture the intended concepts from topology and algebraic topology. It also does not use Mathlib’s existing notions (e.g., PathConnectedSpace, FundamentalGroup) and hence is not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Core notions (simply connected, countable basis, path connected) are replaced by vacuous predicates (True). This is a major mismatch.
- The fundamental group is replaced by PUnit, not Mathlib’s FundamentalGroup X x0. This changes the meaning drastically.
- The theorem depends on a basepoint x0, which is fine in a rigorous formalization, but the code does not relate different basepoints or the path-connected equivalence; still, the main issue is the vacuous and incorrect definitions.
- No Mathlib terms for these notions are used, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation; it relies on vacuous placeholders and an incorrect stand-in for the fundamental group. If the placeholders were replaced by the correct Mathlib notions and the fundamental group, the theorem statement’s shape would be faithful (modulo basepoint), but as written it fails.

- The theorem `compact_space_pi_iff : CompactSpace (∀ i, X i) ↔ ∀ i, CompactSpace (X i)` states: The product space (the Pi-type) `∏ i, X i` is compact if and only if each factor `X i` is compact. This is the standard Tychonoff theorem formulation in Mathlib: the product (with the product topology) is compact iff each factor is compact.

2) Does this faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that every product of topological spaces is compact if and only if a product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
- Read literally, the left side “every product of topological spaces is compact” is a global statement across all families of spaces (i.e., for all families, the product is compact). The right side “a product of compact topological spaces is compact” is the usual Tychonoff direction (if each factor is compact, then the product is compact).
- The Lean theorem instead asserts, for a given family X, an equivalence: the product is compact if and only if each factor is compact. This is strictly stronger and more precise than “if each factor is compact then the product is compact,” and it is not equivalent to the odd global statement “every product of topological spaces is compact.”

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem precisely formalizes: For any given family (∀ i), product compact ↔ all factors compact.
- The natural language statement as written is an equivalence between two different global claims: (A) every product of (arbitrary) topological spaces is compact, and (B) a product of compact topological spaces is compact. (A) trivially implies (B), while (B) does not imply (A). Thus, as written, the NL statement is not equivalent to the Lean theorem.
- Therefore, despite the likely intended meaning being Tychonoff’s equivalence, the literal NL wording does not match the Lean statement. No vacuous definitions or placeholders occur in the Lean code, and it uses standard Mathlib notions, but the mismatch in quantifier structure/meaning remains.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the literal natural language statement.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MeasureTheory Filter` just bring in libraries and namespaces.
- The theorem is named `improper_integral_exists_iff_tails_small` with variables:
  - `f : ℝ → ℝ` a real-valued function on ℝ.
  - `h_int : ∀ M, IntervalIntegrable f volume 0 M`: for every real M, f is Lebesgue-interval-integrable on [0, M] (in mathlib, interval integrable with respect to the Lebesgue measure `volume`). Note: this quantifies over all real M, not just M ≥ 0.
  - `h_abs : True`: a placeholder hypothesis that is vacuous. This appears intended to stand in for “∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞” but does not encode it.
- Conclusion (equivalence):
  - Left side: `∃ L, Tendsto (fun R => intervalIntegral f 0 R volume) atTop (nhds L)` says the net of interval integrals ∫_0^R f (Lebesgue interval integral) converges to some L as R → ∞ (R → atTop in ℝ). This formalizes “the improper integral ∫_0^∞ f exists.”
  - Right side: `∀ ε > 0, ∃ M, ∀ R, M ≤ R → |intervalIntegral f M R volume| < ε` says for every ε>0 there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, the absolute value of the tail integral ∫_M^R f is < ε.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- NL statement hypotheses:
  1) f : [0, ∞) → ℝ is Riemann integrable on every [0, M].
  2) ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞ (absolute integrability of f over [0, ∞) in the improper/Riemann sense).
- Conclusion: ∫_0^∞ f exists iff the tails ∫_M^R f are uniformly small for large M.

Mismatches and issues:
1) Vacuous placeholder for absolute integrability: `h_abs : True` is a blatant red flag. It does not encode the hypothesis “∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞.” This violates the guideline about non-vacuous auxiliary definitions/hypotheses. The original assumption is central and is not represented.
2) Riemann vs Lebesgue integrability: The code uses `IntervalIntegrable ... volume`, i.e., Lebesgue interval integrability, while the NL statement explicitly says “Riemann integrable” on each [0, M]. These are not the same; Lebesgue integrable is strictly more general (e.g., characteristic of ℚ is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable). This is a conceptual mismatch.
3) Domain mismatch: The NL function domain is [0, ∞), whereas the code takes f : ℝ → ℝ and quantifies `h_int` over all real M (including negative M). That is stronger than, and different from, the NL setup.
4) Missing/unused absolute integrability: Even if `h_abs` were replaced by a correct formalization of ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞, the theorem statement does not use it in the equivalence—it merely places it as a hypothesis but the equivalence itself imposes no dependence. The NL problem is “Suppose ... Show ...,” so having the assumption as a hypothesis is fine; however, the current code fails to encode it at all.
5) The main equivalence itself (existence of limit of ∫_0^R f as R→∞ ↔ tails small) is correctly expressed in measure-theoretic terms and matches the mathematical content of the conclusion. But because the premises are not faithfully encoded, the overall translation is not faithful.

Final check:
- The core equivalence matches the intended conclusion but the hypotheses are not faithfully represented: absolute integrability is missing (replaced by `True`), integrability notion differs (Lebesgue vs Riemann), and domain/quantification differ. Given the strict guidelines, this is not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- There is a vacuous placeholder for a central hypothesis and additional mismatches (Riemann vs Lebesgue, domain, quantification). Even if the placeholder were fixed, other mismatches remain. Hence the translation fails. A low grade is warranted.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines are just imports/namespace openings.
- Docstring: ""Let X and Y be topological spaces, and assume Y is Hausdorff (T2). If continuous maps f,g : X → Y agree on a dense subset D of X, then f = g."" This is just a comment; it is not enforced by the theorem signature.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y]` means: X and Y are topological spaces and Y is Hausdorff (T2).
  - `{f g : X → Y}` arbitrary functions from X to Y (no continuity assumed).
  - Hypothesis `(h : Dense {x | f x = g x})`: the set of points where f and g agree is dense in X.
  - Conclusion `f = g` as functions.
  - `by sorry` means no proof is provided; but we only check the statement translation.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL says: ""Let X be a Hausdorff space and Y any topological space. If continuous maps f,g : X → Y agree on a dense subset of X, prove that f=g.""
- Differences:
  - Hausdorff assumption: NL places it on X; Lean places it on Y. This is a core mismatch.
  - Continuity: NL requires f and g to be continuous; Lean does not assume continuity at all.
  - Dense agreement: NL states agreement on a dense subset of X. Lean encodes this as the set {x | f x = g x} being dense, which is equivalent to the existence of a dense subset on which they agree. This part matches.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Hausdorff assumption is on the wrong space in the Lean code (Y instead of X). Also, the Lean statement omits the continuity assumption entirely. These are substantial discrepancies. While the known correct theorem requires the target Y to be Hausdorff and continuity of f,g, the provided NL statement specifies X Hausdorff and Y arbitrary, so the Lean code does not faithfully translate that statement. Additionally, the docstring mentions continuity but the theorem does not include it, which further diverges from the NL statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X is a type with a topology, and X is compact and path connected: [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [PathConnectedSpace X].
- Hypothesis hloc: for every point x : X, there exists an open set U ⊆ X with x ∈ U such that the subspace U is simply connected. In symbols: ∀ x, ∃ U, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ SimplyConnectedSpace (the subspace on U). This encodes “each point has some open simply connected neighborhood.”
- Conclusion: For every base point x0 : X, there exists a finite set S of elements of the fundamental group π1(X, x0) such that the subgroup generated by S is the whole group (Subgroup.closure S = ⊤). This is the usual algebraic characterization of “π1(X, x0) is finitely generated.”

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: “Prove that the fundamental group of any compact, path connected, and locally simply connected topological space is finitely generated.”
- The code requires compactness and path connectedness as in the NL statement. It states the conclusion that for every basepoint the fundamental group is finitely generated, which is appropriate in a path-connected space (basepoint-independence up to isomorphism).
- The mismatch is in the meaning of “locally simply connected.” Standard usage is that each point has a basis of simply connected neighborhoods (equivalently: for every neighborhood U of x, there exists an open simply connected V with x ∈ V ⊆ U). The code assumes only that for each x there exists some open simply connected neighborhood U of x. This is strictly weaker than having a basis of such sets and thus asserts a stronger theorem than the NL statement.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: compactness, path connectedness, conclusion (π1 finitely generated), and basepoint quantified version is fine.
- Different: the local simply connectedness hypothesis in the code is weaker (∃ one simply connected neighborhood) than the standard “locally simply connected” (basis of simply connected neighborhoods). Because of this, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the NL statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the issue is solely the mismatch in the locality quantifier.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  This intends to define the linear map B: R^n → R given by Bx = Σ b_i x_i (the usual dot product), but the linearity proofs are left as sorry placeholders.
- def dot_continuous_linear_map : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] ℝ := ContinuousLinearMap.mk (dot_linear_map (b := b)) (by sorry):
  This turns the linear map into a continuous linear map, but the continuity proof is also a sorry placeholder.

  This claims the operator norm of the above continuous linear functional equals the norm of b (as an element of Fin n → ℝ). The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The NL statement uses the standard Euclidean norm on R^n (the ℓ^2 norm) and asserts that the operator norm of the functional x ↦ b · x equals ‖b‖₂.
- In the Lean code, the underlying space is (Fin n → ℝ), which in Mathlib carries by default the sup (ℓ^∞) norm, not the Euclidean (ℓ^2) norm. Therefore, the operator norm computed here is with respect to ‖·‖_∞ on the domain, and the right-hand side ‖(b : Fin n → ℝ)‖ is also the sup norm of b, not the Euclidean norm. This directly contradicts the NL statement which requires the Euclidean norm.
- Moreover, with the sup norm on the domain, the operator norm of x ↦ Σ b_i x_i is actually the ℓ^1 norm of b (duality between ℓ^∞ and ℓ^1), not the sup norm of b. So even the Lean theorem statement (op norm equals ‖b‖ in the same space) is mathematically false in that setting.
- Multiple sorry placeholders appear in the definitions and theorem. Per the guidelines, the presence of sorry in auxiliary definitions and the final theorem disqualifies the translation.

Step 3: Final comparison
- Differences:
  1) Norm mismatch: NL uses Euclidean (ℓ^2) norm on R^n; code uses the default sup (ℓ^∞) norm on (Fin n → ℝ). The correct way would be to use EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) (or otherwise ensure the Euclidean norm/inner product structure).
  2) The claimed equality in code is incorrect for the chosen normed structure; the operator norm would be ‖b‖₁, not ‖b‖_∞, and certainly not ‖b‖₂ as in the NL statement.
  3) The code relies on sorry placeholders for linearity, continuity, and the main result, violating the requirement against vacuous placeholders.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation of the NL statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Context: E is an arbitrary real normed vector space (NormedAddCommGroup E, NormedSpace ℝ E). A is a bounded (continuous) linear operator A : E →L[ℝ] E.

- Theorem opNorm_eq_supr_unit_sphere:
  Statement: A.opNorm = ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ = 1), ‖A x‖.
  Natural language: The operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ taken over all x with ‖x‖ = 1.

- Theorem opNorm_eq_supr_closed_unit_ball:
  Statement: A.opNorm = ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ ≤ 1), ‖A x‖.
  Natural language: The operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ taken over all x with ‖x‖ ≤ 1.

- Theorem opNorm_eq_supr_open_unit_ball:
  Statement: A.opNorm = ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ < 1), ‖A x‖.
  Natural language: The operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ taken over all x with ‖x‖ < 1.

Step 2: Compare with the original natural language statement
Original statement: Let A be a linear operator on ℝ^n. Show that the operator norm on ℝ^n defined by ||A|| = max{||Ax|| : ||x|| = 1} is equal to sup{||Ax|| : ||x|| ≤ 1} and equal to sup{||Ax|| : ||x|| < 1}.

Key points:
- Domain: The original statement is about ℝ^n (finite-dimensional), while the Lean code states theorems for an arbitrary real normed space E. This is a generalization. While the equalities (with suprema) do hold in general normed spaces, the original uses a definition via a maximum on the unit sphere, which relies on compactness in ℝ^n.
- Notion of maximum vs supremum on the sphere: The original defines the operator norm by a maximum over the unit sphere. The Lean code uses equality to a supremum (⨆) over the unit sphere, not a maximum. In ℝ^n these coincide, but the code does not capture or mention the “max” aspect.
- Technical encoding of the supremum over a subset: The code writes ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ = 1), ‖A x‖ to model sup over {x | ‖x‖ = 1}. This is a nonstandard way to index a supremum in Mathlib: the second binder ranges over proofs hx : ‖x‖ = 1, and the expression ‖A x‖ does not depend on hx. This construction typically collapses to the constant value when such a proof exists and to a bottom element otherwise, which is delicate and potentially ill-formed for ℝ (which is not a complete lattice). A faithful formalization should index over the subtype {x : E // ‖x‖ = 1} or use sSup over the image set. Thus, even as a translation of “sup over x with ‖x‖ = 1,” the chosen encoding is suspect.
- A.opNorm: Mathlib’s opNorm is defined via a supremum (least upper bound) characterization, not via a maximum on the sphere. The Lean statements are consistent with that general definition but do not reflect the original’s specific definition via max in ℝ^n.

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
- Differences:
  1) The Lean code generalizes from ℝ^n to an arbitrary real normed space E. The original statement crucially mentions ℝ^n and defines the norm via a maximum, which relies on finite dimensionality and compactness of the unit sphere.
  2) The Lean code replaces the “max over the unit sphere” by a supremum, losing the attainment aspect present in the original definition.
  3) The supremum is encoded in a nonstandard and likely incorrect way (iSup over a proof binder), which does not faithfully represent “sup over the set {x | ‖x‖ = 1}.”

Given these issues, especially the mismatch in domain (ℝ^n vs arbitrary E), lack of the “max” aspect, and the problematic encoding of the supremum index, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the original statement.

  -- Proof omitted.
  sorry
",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem declares: for each natural number n, there exists a homeomorphism between the topological space `Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit` and the unit sphere in `Fin (n+1) → ℝ`, i.e., the subtype `{x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // x ∈ Metric.sphere (0 : Fin (n+1) → ℝ) 1}`.
- Interpreting the types/topologies:
  - `Fin n → ℝ` is standard ℝ^n with its usual topology (via the product topology).
  - `PUnit` is a singleton type (a one-point space) with its usual topology (discrete/Trivial topology).
  - `Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit` is the disjoint union (coproduct) of ℝ^n and a point, equipped with the sum topology (i.e., the point is an isolated open component; the space is the topological disjoint union ℝ^n ⊔ {⋆}).
  - `{x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // x ∈ Metric.sphere (0) 1}` is the unit sphere S^n.
- The statement is: Nonempty (Homeomorph (ℝ^n ⊔ {⋆}) S^n), i.e., there exists a homeomorphism between the disjoint union of ℝ^n with an isolated point and the unit sphere S^n.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: Prove that the one-point compactification of ℝ^n is homeomorphic to S^n.
- In Mathlib, the one-point compactification is represented by `OnePoint α` (Alexandroff one-point compactification), not by `Sum α PUnit`. The topology on `OnePoint α` is different from the sum topology; it is compact and makes α an open dense subset with neighborhoods of the added point corresponding to complements of compact subsets of α.
- `Sum α PUnit` is the disjoint union topology; the extra point is isolated and the space is not compact if α is noncompact (e.g., ℝ^n). Thus `Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit` is not the one-point compactification of ℝ^n and is not homeomorphic to S^n in general.
- Therefore, the Lean statement asserts the existence of a homeomorphism between the wrong space and S^n.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The natural statement is about `OnePoint (ℝ^n)` ≅ S^n; the code states `(ℝ^n ⊔ {⋆})` ≅ S^n.
- Key differences:
  - Topology on the added point: one-point compactification has non-isolated added point with neighborhoods cofinite in the sense of complement compact; the sum topology isolates the added point.
  - Compactness: OnePoint(ℝ^n) is compact; ℝ^n ⊔ {⋆} is not compact (since ℝ^n isn’t).
  - Thus the spaces are not homeomorphic, and the code does not faithfully translate the statement.
- Additionally, the code does not use Mathlib’s standard `OnePoint` construction, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

  - `by sorry`: proof omitted; that's acceptable per the auditing instructions.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:

- The Lean theorem does NOT assume `[T2Space Y]`; it only assumes `[TopologicalSpace Y]`.
- Everything else (dense subset A, continuity of f and g, agreement on A, and the conclusion f = g) matches the intended content.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- The missing Hausdorff (T2) assumption is critical. The result in general needs Y to be Hausdorff (so that the equalizer is closed via closed diagonal). Without `[T2Space Y]`, the theorem claims a stronger statement than the original and is not faithful to it.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the only issue is the missing `[T2Space Y]` assumption.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem name suggests the setting: continuous bijection from a compact space to a T2 (Hausdorff) space.
- Context: {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] declares X and Y as topological spaces.
- [CompactSpace X] assumes X is compact.
- [T2Space Y] assumes Y is Hausdorff.
- [Nonempty X] assumes X is nonempty.
- {f : X → Y} with (hf : Continuous f) and (hbij : Function.Bijective f) assumes f is a continuous bijection.
- Conclusion: Continuous (Function.invFun f) states that the inverse function (as a function Y → X extracted by invFun from bijectivity) is continuous.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: f: X → Y is a continuous bijection, X is a topological space (no further property), Y is Hausdorff. Conclude f^{-1}: Y → X is continuous.
- Lean statement adds two extra assumptions:
  - X is compact (CompactSpace X).
  - X is nonempty (Nonempty X).
- The use of T2Space Y matches “Hausdorff”. The use of Function.invFun f as the inverse is appropriate under bijectivity.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
- The Lean theorem is not the same as the natural language statement. It proves continuity of the inverse under stronger hypotheses (compactness of X, and also assumes nonemptiness). The original statement does not assume compactness, and in fact is false without additional conditions. Hence the Lean code does not faithfully translate the given statement; it proves a different, stronger (and standard) theorem.
- Additional note: The Nonempty X assumption is unnecessary given bijectivity if one also knew Y is nonempty, but since nonemptiness of Y is not assumed, this still restricts the scope compared to the natural language statement, which allows empty cases. In any case, the main mismatch is compactness of X.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` sets up a natural number n, the dimension.
- `def linear_of_vec (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)` defines a linear map A: ℝ → (Fin n → ℝ) by A x = x • a. The proofs inside `AddMonoidHom.mk` and the scalar compatibility `by intros m x; simp` verify additivity and ℝ-linearity of x ↦ x • a.
- `def A (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ →L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)` upgrades that linear map to a continuous linear map, justified by continuity of scalar multiplication.
- `theorem opNorm_of_smul_vec (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ‖A a‖ = ‖a‖ := by sorry` states that the operator norm of A equals the norm of a in the codomain.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement explicitly says we work with the standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^n, and that for A(x) = x a (a ∈ ℝ^n), the operator norm of A equals the Euclidean norm of a.
- In the Lean code, the codomain is `(Fin n → ℝ)`. In mathlib, this type by default carries the sup norm (ℓ∞) from the Pi-type normed structure, not the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm. To get the Euclidean norm, one should use the type alias `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (or ensure the inner product space instance intended for Euclidean space is in force). The current code does not do this.
- Thus, the theorem `‖A a‖ = ‖a‖` is formulated with the default norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)`, which is generally the sup norm, not the Euclidean norm. So the statement proven in Lean is: the operator norm equals the codomain's default norm of a, not specifically the Euclidean norm.
- While the equality `‖A‖ = ‖a‖` holds for any normed target space (so the formula is true regardless), the natural language problem explicitly specifies the Euclidean norm on ℝ^n. The code does not encode that specificity; it uses `(Fin n → ℝ)` without the EuclideanSpace instances.

Auxiliary definitions:
- `linear_of_vec` and `A` are legitimate, faithful constructions (no vacuous placeholders). The final theorem is stated but left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing translation as per the instructions.

Final check:
- The two mathematical statements are not the same because the Lean code does not ensure the Euclidean norm on ℝ^n; it uses the default Pi-type norm. Therefore, the translation is not faithful to the requirement ""Using the standard Euclidean norm ℝ^n"".

Grade rationale:
- Almost faithful except for the crucial mismatch of the norm on the codomain. No vacuous definitions. Hence, not faithful (score 0), with a high grade reflecting being very close: 9.

  ∃ y : I → M, IsSmooth (y) ∧ HomotopicRel x y := by sorry
",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib. No specific topology or manifold structures are imported/used explicitly.
- def I : Type := { t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1 }: Defines the unit interval I as the subtype of real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive. This is a reasonable model of [0,1] as a type, but no topology is attached explicitly here.
- def IsSmooth {M : Type u} (f : I → M) : Prop := True: Declares a predicate IsSmooth on maps I → M, but it is defined to be True for all such maps. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not encode any notion of smoothness, nor does it require any manifold structure on M.
- def HomotopicRel {M : Type u} (f g : I → M) : Prop := True: Declares a predicate HomotopicRel on pairs of maps I → M, but again it is defined to be True always. It does not encode homotopy, nor the “relative to {0,1}” constraint. Completely vacuous.
- theorem path_homotopic_rel_endpoints_to_smooth {M : Type u} (x : I → M) : ∃ y : I → M, IsSmooth y ∧ HomotopicRel x y := by sorry: States that for any type M and any map x : I → M, there exists y : I → M such that IsSmooth y and HomotopicRel x y. Because both predicates are always True, this reduces to “for any M and x, there exists y”, with no real content about topology/smoothness/homotopy. Also, M is just a type, not a smooth manifold; x is just a function, not a (continuous) path.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation matches the original statement.
Original statement: Let M be a smooth manifold and x : [0,1] → M be a path. Prove x is homotopic relative to {0,1} to a smooth path.
- Missing manifold structure: The code quantifies over arbitrary M : Type u with no topological or smooth structure. There is no SmoothManifold/Manifold structure present.
- Missing path hypothesis: The code treats x as any function I → M, not necessarily continuous (let alone piecewise smooth). No TopologicalSpace M, no continuity assumptions.
- Smoothness is vacuous: IsSmooth := True makes every map “smooth,” ignoring charts and differentiability.
- Homotopy relative to endpoints is vacuous: HomotopicRel := True ignores the homotopy notion and the “relative to {0,1}” condition.
- Endpoints {0,1}: The relative condition is not modeled at all.
Thus, the code does not faithfully state the theorem; it is a trivial statement about arbitrary types and functions with vacuous predicates.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are different. Key discrepancies:
- The original requires M to be a smooth manifold; the code has no such structure.
- The original requires x to be a path (continuous map); the code allows any function.
- The original targets existence of a smooth path; the code’s “smoothness” is True for all functions.
- The original requires homotopy relative to {0,1}; the code’s HomotopicRel is True and does not mention endpoints.
- The code introduces vacuous placeholder predicates, violating the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: Multiple vacuous placeholder definitions, and even if those were replaced by real Mathlib notions, the statement still lacks the necessary manifold and topological structure and the path hypothesis. Hence it falls into the category “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.” A harsh grade of 3 is appropriate.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `constant DeckTrans : Type u → Type u`: Introduces an arbitrary type family DeckTrans assigning to any type X another type, intended as a placeholder for “the deck transformation group of X,” but with no structure or connection to topology.
- `constant FundamentalGroup : Type u → Type u`: Introduces an arbitrary type family FundamentalGroup assigning to any type X another type, intended as a placeholder for the fundamental group, but again with no structure, no basepoint, and no topology assumed.
- The theorem `deck_transformation_group_of_universal_cover_is_fundamental_group (X : Type u) (is_hausdorff : Prop) (is_path_connected : Prop) (is_locally_simply_connected : Prop) : DeckTrans X ≃ FundamentalGroup X := by sorry` states: Given any type X and any propositions is_hausdorff, is_path_connected, is_locally_simply_connected (which are not tied to X in any way), there is a type equivalence between DeckTrans X and FundamentalGroup X. No topological structure is assumed on X, no universal covering is mentioned or constructed, and the result is only a bare equivalence of types, not a group isomorphism.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The NL statement: Let X be Hausdorff, path connected, and locally simply connected. Then the deck transformation group of the universal covering of X is precisely π1(X), with group operation induced by concatenation of loops ([x][y] = [x*y]).
Key features required:
- X must be a topological space with Hausdorff, path connected, and locally simply connected hypotheses that actually apply to X.
- There must be a universal covering space of X; the deck transformation group refers to automorphisms of that universal cover covering map.
- The conclusion is a group isomorphism (not just a bijection of underlying sets) between the deck transformation group and π1(X), and the group law corresponds to concatenation of loops.
- π1(X) in mathlib depends on a basepoint; path-connectedness is used to identify different basepoints up to isomorphism.

The Lean code fails on all these:
- It uses bare constants as placeholders for both deck transformations and fundamental group, not mathlib definitions. No TopologicalSpace instance is required.
- The hypotheses `is_hausdorff`, `is_path_connected`, `is_locally_simply_connected` are arbitrary Props, not connected to X and not used. They do not impose any properties on X.
- The theorem asserts an `Equiv` (type equivalence), not a group isomorphism; hence it ignores the group structure entirely and certainly does not encode the operation [x][y]=[x*y].
- It does not involve the universal covering space or deck transformations in the proper sense.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The Lean statement is vastly weaker and in fact unrelated: it claims a bijection between two arbitrary placeholder types for any type X and any unrelated Props, with no group structure or topology. The NL statement is a precise group isomorphism statement under specific topological hypotheses, tied to the universal cover and concatenation of loops.

Additional red flags per guidelines:
- Use of non-mathlib placeholders for core concepts (DeckTrans, FundamentalGroup) and lack of TopologicalSpace structure is a serious deviation.
- The conclusion is an `Equiv` rather than a group isomorphism.
- The universal covering is not modeled at all.
- The comments mention the intended meaning, but comments do not enforce semantics in Lean.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: Vacuous placeholders are used, and even if one replaced them with legitimate definitions, the theorem as stated (an `Equiv` with arbitrary Props) would still not be faithful because it lacks the correct hypotheses, the universal cover, and group structure. This matches the rubric around 3.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X and Y are types. X has a PseudoMetricSpace structure (not a MetricSpace). f : X → Y is a function, assumed surjective.
- Statement: There exists a PseudoMetricSpace structure m on Y such that the topology arising from the uniform space of m equals the coinduced topology on Y from f and the topology on X coming from its pseudometric uniform structure. In words: the coinduced (i.e., quotient) topology on Y via f is the topology of some pseudometric on Y.

Assessment vs the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let f : X → Y be a surjective map, where X is a metric space. Prove that the quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric on Y.”
- Key points in NL:
  1) X is a metric space (not just pseudometric).
  2) The quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric (not just a pseudometric) on Y.

Comparisons and differences:
- Metric vs Pseudometric on X: The Lean statement assumes [PseudoMetricSpace X], which is weaker than “X is a metric space.” While a MetricSpace is a PseudoMetricSpace, the Lean statement is not stating exactly the NL assumption; it generalizes the hypothesis. This could be acceptable if the conclusion matched, but see next point.
- Metric vs Pseudometric on Y: The crucial mismatch. The Lean theorem asserts existence of a PseudoMetricSpace structure on Y whose topology equals the coinduced topology. The NL statement explicitly claims that the quotient topology arises from a metric on Y. A pseudometric permits distinct points at distance 0, so it is strictly weaker. In general, the quotient of a metric space by a surjection need not be metrizable (Hausdorff/T1), so one typically only gets a pseudometric without additional separation hypotheses. Thus the Lean statement is not equivalent to the NL statement; it proves a weaker conclusion.
- Quotient/coinduced topology: The Lean code uses TopologicalSpace.coinduced f t_X, which is indeed the usual quotient (final) topology induced by a surjective map. So that part matches the NL statement conceptually.
- Use of UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace: This is a standard way in Mathlib to refer to the topology induced by a (pseudo)metric, and it is fine.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is just a single theorem with a “sorry” proof placeholder, which is acceptable for the translation audit.

Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean code claims existence of a pseudometric on Y giving the quotient topology, whereas the NL statement claims existence of a metric on Y. This is a substantive and central difference. Additionally, the Lean assumptions allow X to be only pseudometric, while the NL requires metric. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

The proof is omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Let X be a Hausdorff topological space and Y any compact topological space. Prove that the first projection X × Y → X is a closed map."" 
- The Lean statement exactly assumes X Hausdorff (T2Space X), Y compact (CompactSpace Y), and concludes IsClosedMap for Prod.fst. This matches the mathematical content precisely.

3) Final check and differences:
- No extra or missing hypotheses: No assumption on Y being Hausdorff (not needed), and exactly the intended compactness and Hausdorff assumptions are present.
- Correct Mathlib notions: T2Space, CompactSpace, IsClosedMap, and Prod.fst are standard.

This is the classical definition of the topological closure of `A`.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts: For a subset `A` of a topological space `X`, `A ⊆ closure A`. The code defines `my_closure` as the intersection of all closed supersets of `A`, which is a standard and correct definition of the closure of `A`. The theorem then exactly asserts `A ⊆ my_closure A`. Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the claim using a legitimate definition of closure.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is naming: the code uses `my_closure` instead of Mathlib’s `closure`. However, `my_closure` is a faithful, standard definition (intersection of all closed supersets), not a vacuous placeholder. No additional or missing hypotheses are present. There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions. Therefore, the mathematical content matches the original statement.
- While the code does not explicitly identify `my_closure` with Mathlib’s `closure`, that is not required for faithfulness to the English mathematical statement, which did not commit to a specific formalization of closure.

- The theorem asserts the equivalence: `Continuous f` ↔ `∀ x : X, ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ y : X, dist y x < δ → dist (f y) (f x) < ε`.
  • `Continuous f` is the topological notion: preimages of open sets are open, for the topologies induced by the metric structures.
  • The right-hand side is the ε–δ definition of continuity in a metric space: for every point x and every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if y is within δ of x (in X’s metric), then f y is within ε of f x (in Y’s metric).
- There are no auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions; only a single theorem statement with `by sorry` (proof omitted), which is acceptable per the instructions.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For X and Y subsets of Euclidean spaces with the subspace topologies, f : X → Y is continuous (preimages of open sets are open) iff f is continuous in the usual ε–δ sense.
- The Lean theorem is stated for general metric spaces X and Y, which strictly generalizes “subsets of Euclidean spaces” (since those are particular metric spaces with the subspace metric). The docstring explicitly notes this: “in particular subspaces of Euclidean spaces with the subspace topologies.”
- The left side `Continuous f` matches the topological continuity (preimages of opens are open) under the metric-induced topologies.
- The right side exactly matches the ε–δ definition in metric spaces.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- The Lean statement is strictly more general (metric spaces instead of subsets of Euclidean spaces), but it directly implies the original statement as a special case. There is no mismatch in the notion of continuity or in the ε–δ condition. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The terminology and structures are standard Mathlib.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful (indeed, a standard generalization).

Assessment against the original statement:
- The original statement: “Every proper local diffeomorphism f : P → Q between manifolds without boundary, with Q connected, is a covering map.”
- Problems:
  1) All key notions (manifold without boundary, local diffeomorphism, proper, covering map) are defined as vacuous True-valued classes. This obliterates the actual mathematical content.
  2) The connectedness assumption is modeled as an arbitrary Prop variable Q_connected, not as “Q is connected” (e.g., ConnectedSpace Q or isConnected (univ)). It is not even related to Q; it is an independent Prop parameter.
  3) The code does not use Mathlib’s manifold or covering map frameworks at all. There are no topological or smooth structures on P, Q, so the context of diffeomorphism/proper/covering is not captured.
  4) While the outer shape of the lemma name and English comment resembles the original theorem, the formal statement is vacuous: from meaningless assumptions we conclude a meaningless conclusion, and the “connectedness” is not represented correctly.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is not a faithful formalization: it replaces all substantive definitions by trivial ones and misrepresents connectedness as an arbitrary Prop. Even if the proof is omitted, the translation must accurately encode the mathematical content, which it does not.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definitions throughout (major red flag).
- Connectivity is not properly tied to Q.
- If all placeholders were replaced with legitimate Mathlib notions (manifolds without boundary, local diffeomorphism, proper map, covering map, and connectedness of Q), the overall intended statement would match the natural language. Hence, while currently unfaithful, it could become faithful with substantial replacement of placeholders.
- According to the rubric, that corresponds to a mid-range score because the final theorem would be faithful if placeholders were fixed.

  This sets up X and Y as types with topological space structures, each Hausdorff (T2) and path connected. This matches part of the hypotheses: X and Y are path connected Hausdorff topological spaces.
- `variable (x0 : X) (y0 : Y) (f : X → Y) (h : f x0 = y0)`:
  Chooses basepoints x0 ∈ X, y0 ∈ Y, a function f : X → Y, and a proof that f x0 = y0. This matches the basepoint condition y0 = f(x0), but there is no assumption that f is continuous or a covering map.
- `variable (pi_quot : Type*) (to_fiber : pi_quot → {x : X // f x = y0})`:
  Introduces an arbitrary type `pi_quot` and an arbitrary function `to_fiber` from that type to the fiber `{x : X // f x = y0}`. There is no connection to the fundamental group or to the quotient π1(Y, y0)/f_* π1(X, x0); this is a pure placeholder.
- `theorem covering_space_quotient_bijection : Function.Bijective (to_fiber : pi_quot → {x : X // f x = y0}) := by sorry`:
  Asserts, with no additional hypotheses, that the arbitrary function `to_fiber` is bijective. This is not justified by any of the given assumptions and does not encode the claimed map from the π1-quotient.

2) Does the whole Lean statement faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: If X and Y are path connected Hausdorff topological spaces and f : X → Y is a covering map with y0 = f(x0), then the map π1(Y, y0)/f_* π1(X, x0) → X_{y0} is bijective.
- The Lean code:
  - Does not assume f is a covering map (not even continuity).
  - Does not define π1(Y, y0), f_* π1(X, x0), or their quotient. Instead, it uses an arbitrary type `pi_quot`.
  - Does not define the canonical map from the quotient to the fiber; instead, it assumes an arbitrary function `to_fiber` and asserts it is bijective without conditions.
  - While it correctly models the fiber as `{x : X // f x = y0}` and includes the basepoint condition `h : f x0 = y0`, it omits the essential mathematical structures and hypotheses that make the statement true.
  - The theorem as stated claims bijectivity for any function from an arbitrary type to the fiber, which is not only unrelated to the intended statement but also false in general.

3) Final check: Are the two math statements the same?
- Differences:
  - Missing covering map assumption (critical).
  - Missing use of the fundamental group and its subgroup image; `pi_quot` is an arbitrary type, not π1(Y, y0)/f_* π1(X, x0).
  - Missing the specific canonical map defined via path lifting; `to_fiber` is arbitrary.
  - Asserts bijectivity unconditionally, unlike the conditional statement in the natural language.
  - No use of Mathlib's fundamental group or covering map definitions; heavy placeholders contrary to the guideline of using applicable Mathlib terms.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It replaces the key mathematical objects with arbitrary placeholders and asserts a bijection without the necessary hypotheses or definitions.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Using Mathlib.
- def IsCovering {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : Y → X) : Prop := True: Introduces a predicate IsCovering for maps p : Y → X, but it is defined to be always true. This is an explicit placeholder, not the real notion of a covering map.
- theorem exists_universal_cover (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (hpc : PathConnectedSpace X) (hlsc : ∀ x : X, ∃ U : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U)) : ∃ (Y : Type*) (tY : TopologicalSpace Y) (p : Y → X), IsCovering p ∧ SimplyConnectedSpace Y := by sorry:
  Translation: For any topological space X that is path connected and such that for every point x there exists an open neighborhood U containing x whose induced-topology subtype is simply connected, there exists a type Y with a topology and a map p : Y → X such that p is a “covering map” (as per the placeholder IsCovering) and Y is simply connected. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement: Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space X has a universal covering space \tilde{X} → X. In standard terms, this means: if X is path connected and locally simply connected, then there exists a simply connected space \tilde{X} and a genuine covering map \tilde{X} → X.

Discrepancies:
- Covering map predicate: The code uses IsCovering p := True, a vacuous placeholder. This does not enforce any covering-map properties. By the guidelines, this is a fatal issue: an auxiliary definition is vacuous.
- Locally simply connected: The code formalizes this as ∀ x, ∃ open U containing x with SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U). The standard definition of “locally simply connected” is that each point has a neighborhood basis of simply connected open sets (or equivalent formulations). Requiring just the existence of one simply connected neighborhood per point is generally weaker than the standard definition and not equivalent in general. Thus, even if the covering map predicate were fixed, the hypothesis would not faithfully match the usual notion of locally simply connected.
- Universal cover: The intended conclusion is the existence of a simply connected covering map \tilde{X} → X. The code’s conclusion, with IsCovering being True, collapses to the existence of some simply connected space Y and an arbitrary map p : Y → X. This is much weaker and not faithful to “universal covering space”.
- Use of Mathlib concepts: The code does not use Mathlib’s actual covering map definition (e.g., CoveringMap), and instead introduces a placeholder. This is a red flag per the guidelines. The rest (PathConnectedSpace, SimplyConnectedSpace) may be Mathlib notions, but the key notion is missing.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
The Lean statement is not a faithful translation. It introduces a vacuous predicate for covering maps and weakens the locally simply connected hypothesis. Therefore, it fails the strict translation test.

Grade rationale: Because of the vacuous IsCovering and the mismatch in the locally simply connected hypothesis, even fixing the placeholder would still leave a non-faithful statement. This aligns with a low score: 3.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- universe u; variables {X Y : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]: We work with topological spaces X and Y.
- variable (IsCovering : (X → Y) → Prop): Introduces an arbitrary predicate on maps X → Y meant to stand for ""f is a covering map"". This is a placeholder, not Mathlib’s definition.
- variable (pi1 : Type u → Type u): Introduces an arbitrary assignment of a type to each type, intended to represent the fundamental group of a space. This ignores basepoints and also ignores the topological structure (it only depends on the underlying type), so it’s a placeholder.
- variable (pi1_map : ∀ (f : X → Y), pi1 X → pi1 Y): Introduces an arbitrary function assigned to each map f : X → Y, intended to be the induced map on fundamental groups. This is again a placeholder; it’s defined for any map, not just covering maps, and does not account for basepoints.
- theorem covering_map.induced_on_fundamental_group_injective (f : X → Y) (hcov : IsCovering f) [T2Space X] : Function.Injective (pi1_map f) := by sorry: States that if f is a covering map (as per the placeholder IsCovering) and X is Hausdorff, then the induced map (as per the placeholder pi1_map) is injective. Proof omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: ""The morphism of fundamental groups f_* : π1(X) → π1(Y) induced by a covering map f : X → Y on a Hausdorff space X is injective.""
- The code’s theorem shape matches the high-level claim: under the assumption that f is a covering map and X is Hausdorff, the induced map on fundamental groups is injective.
- However, all core mathematical notions are placeholders:
  - Covering map is an arbitrary predicate IsCovering, not Mathlib’s concept.
  - Fundamental group is modeled by pi1 : Type → Type, ignoring basepoints and even the topological structure.
  - The induced map pi1_map is an arbitrary function for any f, not specifically defined via homotopy classes or basepoint constraints.
- The statement in topology generally requires basepoints for π1 and the induced map f_*. The code completely omits basepoints, which is a significant mismatch (even if sometimes suppressed in informal writing). Moreover, the code does not ensure the map is a group homomorphism (though injectivity as a function is the relevant property, the term “morphism” suggests group structure).
- The code adds the Hausdorff assumption on X via [T2Space X], which matches the wording, though this is nonstandard and not needed for the usual theorem; but this is acceptable as a translation if intended.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
- Due to the placeholders, the code does not faithfully represent “covering map,” “fundamental group,” or “induced map.” It treats them as arbitrary parameters without any of the defining structure. This makes the translation not faithful per the strict guidelines.
- The omission of basepoints is another substantive deviation from the standard meaning of the statement.
- Therefore, the Lean code is not a legitimate, faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale
- The final theorem’s form aligns loosely with the intended claim (injectivity of an induced map under a covering map and Hausdorff assumption on X), but every crucial concept is a placeholder and basepoints are omitted. If the placeholders were replaced with faithful Mathlib definitions (including basepoints), the shape could be repaired, but as-is it fails the faithfulness requirement.
- Following the rubric and being extra harsh, this earns a non-faithful score with a mid-range grade for being structurally close but using vacuous placeholders.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set` just bring in Mathlib and set notation; no mathematical content changes.
- `theorem boundary_eq_inter_closure_compl_extracted {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X} : frontier A = closure A ∩ closure (univ \ A) := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type X with a topological space structure and any subset A of X, the frontier (boundary) of A equals the intersection of the closure of A and the closure of `univ \ A`. Here `frontier` is Mathlib’s term for boundary, `closure` is the topological closure, and `univ \ A` denotes the set difference X \ A (since `univ` is the whole space X viewed as a set). There is no proof, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let X be a topological space and let A ⊆ X be any subset. Prove that the boundary of A equals the closures of A and X − A intersected: ∂A = \overline{A} ∩ \overline{X − A}.”
- The Lean code states: `frontier A = closure A ∩ closure (univ \ A)`. In Mathlib, `frontier A` is exactly the boundary of A, and `univ \ A` is the complement of A in X, i.e., X − A. Thus the expressions match exactly: ∂A = cl(A) ∩ cl(X − A).

3) Final check for differences:
- Boundary vs frontier: same concept in Mathlib.
- X − A vs univ \ A: identical in a type X (univ is the entire space X), so this matches.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it is a single theorem statement.
- Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is correct and faithful.

- The theorem declaration:
  • Variables: X is a type with a TopologicalSpace structure.
  • p : Real → X is a map.
  • hconn : ConnectedSpace X is the hypothesis that X is connected.
  • hcov : IsCoveringMap p states that p is a covering map in the mathlib sense.

- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; IsCoveringMap and Circle are standard mathlib.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the only topological spaces with ℝ as a covering space are ℝ and S¹."" This means: if there exists a covering map from ℝ onto a space X, then X is (homeomorphic to) ℝ or S¹.
- Lean theorem: Assumes there is a covering map p : ℝ → X, and concludes X is homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹. This matches the classification direction stated.
- The Lean theorem also assumes X is connected. This is redundant because the continuous image of connected ℝ under a surjective covering map is connected; covering maps are surjective in mathlib (or surjectivity follows from the evenly-covered condition). Hence this extra hypothesis does not change the meaning.
- The conclusion is expressed via existence of a homeomorphism (Nonempty (Homeomorph ...)), precisely encoding ""is homeomorphic to"".

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous placeholders; all concepts use mathlib.
- No auxiliary definitions.
- The only apparent difference is the explicit connectedness assumption, which is implied by the existence of a covering map from ℝ. Therefore, there is no substantive mismatch.
- The natural language statement does not assert the converse (that ℝ and S¹ indeed have ℝ as a covering space), and the Lean theorem likewise only proves the classification direction. So they match in logical direction.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- We work over a scalar field 𝕜 which is a nontrivially normed field. E and E' are finite-dimensional normed vector spaces over 𝕜. H, H' are topological model types, and I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H, I' : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H' provide the manifold models.
- M and M' are types equipped with charted space structures modelled on H and H' respectively. So M, M' are (smooth) manifolds modelled on E, E' via I, I'.
- f : M → M' is a map that is ContMDiff I I' (⊤) f, i.e., smooth (C^∞) between these manifolds.
- The dimension hypothesis is Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E', i.e., dim M < dim M' since M and M' are modelled on finite-dimensional E and E'.
- Conclusion: IsNowhereDense (range f), i.e., the image f(M) is nowhere dense in the ambient space M'.

2) Comparing with the natural language statement:
- NL: Let φ : P → Q be a smooth map of manifolds with dim P < dim Q. Show that φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.
- Lean: Exactly asserts: given a smooth map f between manifolds M → M' with dim M < dim M' (interpreted via model spaces E, E'), then range f is nowhere dense in M'.
- The statement is expressed with standard mathlib notions: smoothness via ContMDiff to top order, finite-dimensionality via FiniteDimensional and dimension via Module.rank, and nowhere denseness via IsNowhereDense (range f).

3) Differences or red flags:
- Generality: The Lean statement is over an arbitrary nontrivially normed field 𝕜, while the NL statement typically assumes real manifolds. This is a harmless generalization for translation purposes (it implies the real case) and does not change the mathematical meaning of the claim in the intended context.
- Manifold structure: The code uses ChartedSpace and ModelWithCorners rather than explicitly assuming SmoothManifoldWithCorners instances. In mathlib, ContMDiff is the right predicate for smoothness and is tied to the chosen models; this still reflects a “smooth map of manifolds.”
- Technical parameter: The use of (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞) to denote C^∞ regularity is slightly unusual but still conveys “smooth.” There are no fake or vacuous definitions; no auxiliary defs; only a theorem statement.

Given these points, the Lean theorem statement faithfully translates the NL statement. The minor generalization in the base field and the slightly technical presentation of smoothness are not deviations in meaning.

Since all predicates are True, the statement reduces to: for any types M, N and any function f : M → N, there exists g : M → N. The existential may even be false if M is nonempty and N is empty; but this is irrelevant to translation—the key issue is that the predicates are vacuous and not the actual Mathlib notions.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original statement: Let M and N be smooth manifolds and let f ∈ C^0(M, N) (i.e., f is continuous). Show that f is homotopic to a smooth map M → N.
Lean statement shape: Existence of a smooth g homotopic to a continuous f between smooth manifolds. At a high level, the logical form matches. However, all relevant concepts (smooth manifold, continuous map, smooth map, homotopy) are defined as True, not using Mathlib's real structures (TopologicalSpace, ChartedSpace, Smooth manifold with corners, ContMDiff, Continuous, Homotopy). Thus the code does not faithfully encode the intended mathematical content.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code uses vacuous placeholder predicates for all key notions, and M, N lack any manifold or even topological structure. No Mathlib terminology for manifolds or homotopy is used. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Auxiliary definitions assessment: All four introduced predicates are vacuous (:= True), violating the guideline against vacuous placeholders. Hence the translation fails.

If placeholders were replaced with the proper Mathlib structures (e.g., [TopologicalSpace], [ChartedSpace H M], [SmoothManifoldWithCorners], Continuous f, ContMDiff, Homotopy), then the theorem statement would be faithful in form. As is, it is not.

Also, Y is arbitrary and not specified as a quotient, and q is arbitrary and not specified as the quotient map.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: Given a free action by isometries with discrete orbits, prove that the canonical quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map.
Lean theorem: claims existence of some Y and some q : X → Y with (vacuous) properties. It does not:
- construct or mention the quotient space X/Γ,
- assert that q is the quotient map,
- use non-vacuous notions of “covering map” or “local isometry,”
- tie q in any way to the action.
Thus even ignoring the vacuity, the statement is strictly weaker (existential vs. a specific map and specific codomain).

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- Major red flag: MyIsCoveringMap and MyIsLocalIsometry are defined as True (vacuous). This violates the guidelines.
- Even if those were replaced by proper Mathlib definitions, the theorem would still be too weak: it asserts existence of some Y and some locally isometric covering map q, not that the quotient map X → X/Γ has these properties. No quotient is formed or referenced.
- Therefore, the code does not faithfully translate the given statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The code works in a topological space X and takes f, g, h as continuous maps from the unit interval to X (i.e., paths in a very broad sense).
- The theorem `concat_defined_iff` states: (f(1) = g(0) ∧ g(1) = h(0)) ↔ (f(1) = g(0) ∧ g(1) = h(0)). This is a tautology (P ↔ P). There is no definition of concatenation `(f * g)` or a predicate for “is defined.” There is only an informal comment that says they “formalise ‘defined’ as the conjunction of the required endpoint equalities.”

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- The original statement: For paths x, y, z : [0,1] → X, prove that (x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.
- Mathematically, definability of (x*y)*z requires x(1) = y(0) and y(1) = z(0), and definability of x*(y*z) requires the same two conditions. Thus the equivalence holds.
- However, the Lean code does not mention concatenation at all, nor does it define or even name a predicate that corresponds to “(f*g)*h is defined” or “f*(g*h) is defined.” It simply proves (as a theorem statement) that the same conjunction implies itself, i.e., P ↔ P. The connection between this P and the definability of either concatenation is only in a comment, not in formal code.

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement does not encode the definability of (f*g)*h or f*(g*h) in any form. It replaces both sides by the same raw conjunction and then asserts P ↔ P. Without formalizing that “defined” for (f*g)*h and for f*(g*h) are both exactly this conjunction, the theorem does not faithfully translate the original statement. The code’s theorem is strictly weaker (and in fact trivial), and it bypasses the actual content by not relating the conjunction to concatenation at all.

Other checks:
- No vacuous definitions are introduced, but the critical notion (“defined”) is never defined in code; it is only described in a comment. The theorem is thus disconnected from the intended meaning.
- Use of Mathlib terms: They use C(unitInterval, X), which is fine, but they do not use or define path concatenation nor a predicate for definability.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It does not formally capture the relationship between the definability of (x*y)*z and x*(y*z); it merely states a tautology with no connection to concatenation.

- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib. Fine.
- universe u v; variable {X : Type u} {Y : Type v} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]: Two types X, Y with topologies. OK.
- def fiber (p : X → Y) (y0 : Y) := { x : X // p x = y0 }: Defines the fiber p^{-1}(y0) as a subtype. Faithful to X_{x0} := p^{-1}(x0) notion.
- variables (p : X → Y) (y0 : Y) (pi1 : Type u) [Group pi1]: Introduces p, y0 and an abstract group pi1. This is not the fundamental group π1(Y, y0) or π1(X, x0); it’s an arbitrary group. Red flag.
- variable (is_covering : Prop) (path_connected : Prop) (locally_simply_connected : Prop): Introduces three arbitrary propositions, not tied to Y nor using Mathlib’s notions of covering spaces, path-connectedness, or local simple connectedness. These are vacuous placeholders, not faithful.
- theorem fundamental_group_acts_on_fibre_continuous : is_covering → path_connected → locally_simply_connected → ∃ (act : pi1 → fiber p y0 → fiber p y0), True := by sorry: States that under those three (arbitrary) conditions, there exists some function act : pi1 → fiber p y0 → fiber p y0, with no properties (just True). There is no group action structure enforced (no identity/compatibility axioms), no specification that pi1 is a fundamental group of Y at y0, no description matching [x][y] = [x*y], and no continuity. Also, the proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural statement: For every covering space p : X → Y of a path connected and locally simply connected topological space Y, the fundamental group π1(X, x0) acts on the fiber X_{x0} = p^{-1}(x0) by [x][y] = [x*y], and the action is continuous.
Issues:
- Group identity: The code uses an arbitrary group pi1, not the fundamental group. It is not tied to X or Y. This is a serious mismatch. (Also, mathematically the acting group should be π1(Y, y0), not π1(X, x0), but regardless, the code doesn’t even attempt to reference the fundamental group.)
- Hypotheses: is_covering, path_connected, locally_simply_connected are arbitrary Props, not actual conditions about p and Y. Not faithful.
- Action structure: The code produces a bare function pi1 → fiber p y0 → fiber p y0 without asserting group action laws. Not faithful.
- Specific action formula: The code does not encode the action [x][y] = [x*y] or any path-lifting description. Not faithful.
- Continuity: The code does not state continuity of the action; it puts a trivial True placeholder. Not faithful.
- Quantification: The natural language says “for every covering space p ... of Y” and ties properties to Y. The code fixes arbitrary p, y0 and hypotheses that are not tied to Y, so it does not express the universal quantification properly.

Step 3: Final check
The two statements are different in multiple critical ways: the acting group, the nature of the hypotheses, the existence vs. structure of an action, the continuity claim, and the specific formula for the action are all missing or incorrect in the Lean code. Furthermore, several vacuous placeholders are used. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: Multiple vacuous placeholders, missing core content (fundamental group, action axioms, continuity, specific formula), and hypotheses are not tied to the intended objects. Even if placeholders were replaced with real definitions, the theorem statement as written still doesn’t require group action laws or continuity. Hence grade 3 per rubric.

With the above vacuous definitions, this statement is meaningless (and in fact trivial because num_sheets is constantly none), and it is left as sorry. Conceptually, it talks about overlap of evenly covered sets, not about a path.
- theorem covering_map_n_to_one_of_path_connected ... : ∃ (n : Option Nat), ∀ (y : Y), ∃ (U : Set Y), y ∈ U ∧ IsOpen U ∧ evenly_covered p U ∧ num_sheets p U = n := by sorry: States that if p is a covering map and Y is path connected, there exists a fixed n (Option Nat, with none = ∞) such that every point has an evenly covered open neighborhood with exactly n sheets. With placeholders, this is vacuous; also proved by sorry.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement: “Prove that the number n of sheets (possibly ∞) above an evenly covered open set is constant along any path in Y. In particular, if Y is path connected, this number n is constant, and we say the covering map is n to 1.”
- Core notions (covering map, evenly covered, number of sheets, path connectedness) are replaced by trivial/vacuous definitions (True or constant none). This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be faithful and non-vacuous.
- The code does not state the main claim “constant along any path in Y.” There is no definition of a path, no theorem quantifying over paths, nor any path argument. The overlap lemma is weaker and not expressed in terms of paths.
- The “in particular” part is approximated by the second theorem: existence of n such that each point has some evenly covered neighborhood with n sheets. This matches a common formulation of n-to-1 coverings, but because all predicates are vacuous, it does not faithfully capture the intended meaning.
- Even ignoring vacuity, the second theorem asserts existence of one evenly covered neighborhood per point with n sheets; it does not assert that every evenly covered open set anywhere in Y has n sheets. The original first part (constancy along any path) would imply a stronger global constancy across all evenly covered opens in a path-connected space; the code does not state this.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code uses vacuous placeholders for all key concepts, so it does not formalize the intended notions.
- It omits any theorem about constancy along a path; it only includes an overlap lemma and a global “path connected implies fixed n” statement, both with vacuous definitions and no proofs.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Verdict: Not faithful. Major issues: vacuous auxiliary definitions, missing path-based statement, and weakened/ambiguous global constancy claim even if definitions were fixed.

- The theorem statement:

  Natural language: Let f : X → Y be a map between topological spaces, assume f is continuous and Y is Hausdorff (T2). Then f is a proper map if and only if every fiber f^{-1}({y}) is compact for all y in Y, and f is a closed map.
  Here `IsProperMap f` is Mathlib’s notion of a proper map (the standard one), `IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})` says the fiber over y is compact, and `IsClosedMap f` says f maps closed sets to closed sets. The continuity hypothesis `hf : Continuous f` and Hausdorff assumption `[T2Space Y]` match the statement’s assumptions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Let f : X → Y be a continuous map to a Hausdorff space Y. Prove that f is proper iff both (a) every fiber f^{-1}(y) is compact, and (b) f is a closed map.”
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly this equivalence under the assumptions that f is continuous and Y is Hausdorff, using standard Mathlib predicates: `IsProperMap f` for “f is proper”, fiber compactness expressed as `IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})`, and `IsClosedMap f` for “f is closed.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The presence of the continuity hypothesis `hf` and the Hausdorff assumption `[T2Space Y]` matches the natural language. Even if `IsProperMap f` in Mathlib may or may not include continuity internally, the theorem assumes `hf`, so it faithfully reflects the stated context.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Quantifiers and conditions align: continuity of f, Y Hausdorff, equivalence between being proper and (compact fibers ∧ closed map).
- The Lean statement uses the preimage of singleton sets to express fibers, which is standard and faithful.
- No extra or missing hypotheses compared to the natural language statement.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: Γ is a group, X is a metric space with a Γ-action (MulAction Γ X). There is an assumption h_isometry that for every γ ∈ Γ, the map x ↦ γ • x is an isometry. This encodes “a group action on a metric space by a group of isometries.”
- Statement: For an arbitrary proposition `others : Prop`, the lemma claims
  (∀ x y : X, ∃ U V : Set X,
    IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V ∧ Disjoint U V ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V ∧
    (∀ γ : Γ, Set.image (fun z : X => γ • z) U ⊆ U) ∧ (∀ γ : Γ, Set.image (fun z : X => γ • z) V ⊆ V)) ↔ others.
  
  The left-hand side expresses: for any two points x,y in X, there exist open sets U,V containing x and y respectively, disjoint from each other, and satisfying (for all γ) γ • U ⊆ U and γ • V ⊆ V. For a group action, the condition ∀ γ, γ • U ⊆ U is equivalent to ∀ γ, γ • U = U (since also applying γ⁻¹ gives the reverse inclusion), so this does capture “Γ-invariant open sets.” Similarly for V.

Comparing to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement says: Under a group action by isometries on a metric space X, the condition “Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets” is equivalent to the other conditions (in some list of equivalences). So the target is: a specific condition (the one about disjoint invariant open sets) is logically equivalent to the conjunction (or some precise proposition) encoding the “other” conditions.

Issues/mismatches:
1) The code introduces `others : Prop` as an arbitrary proposition and then asserts an equivalence to it. This is far stronger and not faithful: the NL statement refers to a specific collection of “other” equivalent conditions, not an arbitrary proposition. The code as written claims equivalence to any proposition whatsoever, which is a major overstatement.
2) The isometry hypothesis `h_isometry` is included but not reflected in the equivalence statement (it is unused in the proposition being equated). Including it is acceptable as context, but it neither restricts nor clarifies what “others” is. This is not by itself wrong, but it underscores that the statement is not tied to a meaningful “others.”
3) The encoding of Γ-invariance as ∀ γ, γ • U ⊆ U (and same for V) is acceptable because Γ is a group, making this equivalent to γ • U = U for all γ. So this part is fine.
4) There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; however, the use of `others : Prop` as a placeholder for the other equivalent conditions is effectively a vacuous stand-in that makes the main statement unfaithfully general.

Final check:
- The Lean lemma claims: “the Γ-invariant disjoint open sets condition” ↔ others, for arbitrary others. The NL statement says: this condition is equivalent to the other conditions (a specific proposition). Because `others` is unconstrained and arbitrary, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- The core condition on U, V, disjointness, openness, and Γ-invariance is correctly encoded.
- But the equivalence target is an arbitrary Prop, not the specific “others,” which makes the translation unfaithful. If `others` were replaced by the precisely defined proposition representing the rest of the equivalences, the statement would be faithful. Hence a mid-low score.

- import Mathlib: Using Mathlib.
- variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]: We fix topological spaces X and Y, and we assume Y is locally compact and Hausdorff (T2).

- First declaration (with docstring):
  Name: closed_injective_is_homeomorphism_of_locally_compact_t2
  Content: Given a function f : X → Y with hypotheses: f is a closed map (IsClosedMap f), f is injective (Function.Injective f), and f is continuous (Continuous f), the code asserts a Homeomorph X (Set.range f), i.e., a homeomorphism between X and the image of f (as a subspace of Y).
  Interpretation: If Y is locally compact Hausdorff, any closed, injective, continuous map f is a homeomorphism onto its image.

- Second declaration (with docstring):
  Name: proper_injective_is_homeomorphism_of_locally_compact_t2
  Content: Given f : X → Y with hypotheses: f is a proper map (IsProperMap f), f is injective, and f is continuous, the code asserts a Homeomorph X (Set.range f).
  Interpretation: In a locally compact Hausdorff codomain, any proper, injective (continuous) map is a homeomorphism onto its image.

Both are stated as defs returning an explicit homeomorphism. The use of `by sorry` indicates the proofs/constructions are omitted, which is acceptable for statement-auditing as long as the statements themselves are faithful.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- Original statement: ""Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Prove that any closed injection f : X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image. In particular, any proper injection f : X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image.""
- The Lean code assumes Y is locally compact Hausdorff globally and then states two results:
  1) If f is a closed injective continuous map, then f is a homeomorphism onto its image.
  2) If f is a proper injective continuous map, then f is a homeomorphism onto its image.
- This matches the intended mathematical content. The second statement is indeed a corollary of the first in LCH spaces (proper maps are closed in LCH Hausdorff spaces). Representing ""homeomorphism onto its image"" as a `Homeomorph X (Set.range f)` is standard and accurate.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- Continuity assumption: The code explicitly assumes `Continuous f` in both statements. The natural language does not state continuity explicitly in the first sentence (“closed injection”), but in typical topology context a “map” is assumed continuous, and “proper map” usually includes continuity by definition. So adding `Continuous f` is aligning with standard usage rather than strengthening the statement improperly. This is a minor wording discrepancy, likely acceptable.
- Extra assumptions on Y for the first statement: The code globally assumes Y is locally compact Hausdorff even for the first result. This is stronger than necessary (the first result does not actually require LCH), but it is consistent with the given natural language which begins with that assumption. So this does not harm faithfulness.
- Use of def vs theorem: Using `def` to produce a `Homeomorph` is a stronger, constructive form of the claim but is a faithful way to express “is a homeomorphism onto its image.” No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; all Mathlib notions used (IsClosedMap, IsProperMap, Continuous, Function.Injective, Homeomorph, Set.range, LocallyCompactSpace, T2Space) are standard.
- There are no vacuous placeholders like `:= True` or bogus auxiliary defs. The `sorry` placeholders are only for the proofs/constructions, not for definitions of concepts, which is acceptable under the auditing rules.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully capture the natural language statements, with the only minor difference being the explicit mention of continuity, which is standard and expected. Therefore, the translation is essentially faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- variable (Γ : Type*) [Group Γ]: Γ is a group.
- variable (X : Type*) [MetricSpace X] [MulAction Γ X]: X is a metric space, and Γ acts on X (by a group action).

- def is_isometric_action : Prop := ∀ (γ : Γ) (x y : X), dist (γ • x) (γ • y) = dist x y
  This states: the action is by isometries; each γ acts as a distance-preserving map on X.

- def covering_action : Prop := ∀ x : X, ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ ∀ γ : Γ, γ ≠ 1 → ((fun y => γ • y) '' Metric.ball x r ∩ Metric.ball x r) = ∅
  This states: for every point x in X, there exists a radius r > 0 such that for all non-identity γ, the image of the ball B(x,r) under γ is disjoint from B(x,r). In a group action, this implies the family {γ • B(x,r)}γ is pairwise disjoint, which is the usual local disjointness condition for a covering action.

- def free_action : Prop := ∀ γ : Γ, γ ≠ 1 → ∀ x : X, γ • x ≠ x
  This states: the action is free (no nontrivial group element fixes any point).

- def orbit (x : X) : Set X := Set.range (fun γ : Γ => γ • x)
  This is the orbit of x under the action.

- def discrete_orbits : Prop := ∀ x y, y ∈ orbit Γ X x → ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ Metric.ball y r ∩ orbit Γ X x = {y}
  This states: every orbit is a discrete subset of X in the metric sense (each orbit point y has a neighborhood whose intersection with the orbit is exactly {y}). Using balls is fine in a metric space since they form a basis.

- theorem covering_action_iff_free_and_discrete_orbits (h_iso : is_isometric_action Γ X) : covering_action Γ X ↔ (free_action Γ X ∧ discrete_orbits Γ X) := by sorry
  This asserts the main equivalence: assuming the action is by isometries, the action is a covering action iff it is free and has discrete orbits.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Given X a metric space and Γ acts by isometries, prove Γ acts on X as a covering action iff the action is free with discrete orbits.

- The hypothesis “acts by isometries” is captured by is_isometric_action and assumed in the theorem.
- “acts on X as a covering action” is modeled by covering_action via the standard local disjointness criterion (for all x, small ball U around x s.t. U and γU are disjoint for γ ≠ 1). This matches a common definition of covering action in this context.
- “free with discrete orbits” is exactly the conjunction of free_action and discrete_orbits as defined.
- The statement is an iff between covering_action and (free ∧ discrete orbits), under the isometry assumption, which matches the natural language equivalence.

Step 3: Final check for mismatches or red flags
- No vacuous definitions: all defs have meaningful content; no placeholders like True or none.
- Use of Mathlib: While the code does not use the IsometricSMul typeclass, it provides a faithful explicit predicate capturing isometries. This is acceptable per the guidelines.
- The notion of covering_action is appropriately captured for metric spaces via disjointness of γ-translates of a small ball. In a group action, disjointness with the base ball for all nontrivial γ implies pairwise disjointness of translates, so it matches the covering action intuition.
- Discrete_orbits uses metric balls and singleton intersection, which is equivalent to discreteness for subsets in metric spaces.
- The statement of the theorem exactly matches the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language theorem with legitimate auxiliary definitions and the correct equivalence.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X, Y, Z are topological spaces. C(U, V) denotes continuous maps U → V (Mathlib’s ContinuousMap).
- snd_comp : C(Y, Z) → C(X × Y, Z) is defined as precomposition with the second projection snd: X × Y → Y. Concretely, it sends f: Y → Z to (x, y) ↦ f(y). This produces functions independent of x.
- is_constant_on_X_fiber (h : C(X × Y, Z)) : Prop is the property ∀ x1 x2 y, h (x1, y) = h (x2, y). Equivalently, h is constant along X-fibers X × {y} (independent of x).
- Theorem snd_comp_range_eq states: the range of snd_comp equals the set of continuous maps X × Y → Z that are constant on each X-fiber X × {y}.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Suppose X and Y are topological spaces and A ⊂ X is dense. Prove that the inclusion of C(Y) → C(X × Y) is an isomorphism onto the functions which are constant on each set {x} × Y with x ∈ X.”

Key mismatches:
1) Dense subset A ⊂ X: The Lean code does not mention A or density at all. The statement explicitly assumes a dense subset A, suggesting some subtlety might be needed, but the code’s formulation ignores it completely.
2) Which fibers are constant: The NL requires functions constant on each set {x} × Y (i.e., independent of y). But the code characterizes the image of C(Y) → C(X × Y) as the functions constant on X × {y} (i.e., independent of x). This is the opposite fiber condition. The map C(Y) → C(X × Y) indeed gives functions independent of x, so the code is internally consistent, but it does not match the NL statement, which talks about constancy in the y-variable.
3) Codomain generality: The code allows an arbitrary target Z. This generalization could be acceptable, but given the other mismatches, it does not salvage faithfulness.
4) Structural form: The code proves an equality of the range with a set of functions having a property, which is the appropriate formalization of “isomorphism onto its image.” That aspect is fine. However, due to (1) and especially (2), the overall translation does not match the NL statement.

Final check: The formal statement proved by the code is different from the natural language statement in two substantial ways: it ignores the dense subset A, and it swaps the fiber direction (constant on X × {y} instead of {x} × Y). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- import Mathlib: We use Mathlib, so FreeGroup and group homs are available.
- universe u v: Universe levels for types S and G.
- noncomputable def freeGroup_lift_equiv {S : Type u} {G : Type v} [Group G] : (S → G) ≃ (FreeGroup S →* G) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any set S and group G, there is an equivalence (bijection) between the set of functions from S to G and the set of group homomorphisms from the free group on S to G. The body is left as sorry (no construction/proof is provided).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The original statement: “Every map of sets f : S → G to a group extends uniquely to a morphism of groups f : ⟨S⟩ → G from the free group on the set S, mapping each s ∈ S to f(s), extending linearly to all words on the alphabet S.”
- Mathematically, this is the universal property of the free group: for each function f : S → G, there exists a unique group hom φ : FreeGroup S →* G such that φ ∘ FreeGroup.of = f. This is often packaged as a canonical equivalence (S → G) ≃ (FreeGroup S →* G), where the equivalence is inverse to precomposition with the canonical inclusion FreeGroup.of : S → FreeGroup S.

Does the Lean statement express this? The type (S → G) ≃ (FreeGroup S →* G) is a bijection between those sets, which is classically equivalent to existence and uniqueness of the extension. However, the bare existence of an equivalence does not specify that the equivalence is the one sending f to the unique hom φ with φ ∘ of = f. The crucial ""extends f on generators"" property is not encoded in the type; it would typically be expressed by naming or by equations relating the equivalence to precomposition with FreeGroup.of. Here, the docstring claims that property, but the declaration’s type alone does not enforce it, and the body is sorry, so we cannot verify it implements the intended equivalence.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
- Similarity: The code’s type suggests the intended universal property via an equivalence between S → G and FreeGroup S →* G, which matches the usual packaging of ""every map extends uniquely"".
- Differences:
  - The Lean statement does not state that the equivalence is inverse to precomposition with FreeGroup.of, i.e., it does not explicitly enforce that the lifted hom sends generators s to f(s). The original statement explicitly requires mapping s to f(s).
  - The definition is left as sorry, so no guarantee is provided that the equivalence is the canonical one or even that it satisfies the extension property.

Given the strict guidelines (extra harsh) and the need for the statement to faithfully capture the original, the absence of the generator-matching condition in the type and the use of sorry mean the translation is not fully faithful.

  Natural language: For any center c in ℝ × ℝ and any radius r > 0, there exists a homeomorphism between the entire plane ℝ × ℝ and the open ball of radius r centered at c (considered as a subtype with the induced topology). The existence is expressed by Nonempty.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: The Euclidean plane ℝ^2 is homeomorphic to any open ball in ℝ^2.
- Code statement: For every c and r > 0, there exists a homeomorphism between ℝ × ℝ and Metric.ball c r (as a subtype). This matches the quantification over center and positive radius and asserts existence of a homeomorphism, which aligns with “is homeomorphic to any open ball.” Using Nonempty (Homeomorph ...) is the standard way to say “there exists a homeomorphism.” Representing ℝ^2 as ℝ × ℝ is standard.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- The only subtlety is the underlying metric on ℝ × ℝ in Mathlib: Metric.ball c r on ℝ × ℝ uses the product/sup metric, whereas “Euclidean plane” typically suggests the Euclidean (ℓ^2) metric. Thus, the open balls appearing in the code are sup-norm balls, not Euclidean (round) balls. Both define the same topology, and in fact each such ball is homeomorphic to ℝ^2, so the truth of the statement is unaffected. However, as a literal translation of “open ball in ℝ^2” (usually meaning Euclidean ball), a more precise formalization might use EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2). Still, the mathematical meaning intended (homeomorphic to any open ball in the plane) is captured: it asserts a homeomorphism from the plane to the open ball in the ambient metric/topology, which is the usual reading in Mathlib when modeling ℝ^2 as ℝ × ℝ.

Given the above, the translation is essentially faithful, with a minor norm/metric convention subtlety that does not change the topological content.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement universally quantifies over all topological spaces X and all subsets A ⊆ X, asserting A ⊆ closure A. This matches the natural language statement: given a topological space X and a subset A, prove A ⊆ \overline{A}. The terms used (`Set`, `closure`, `⊆`) are standard Mathlib constructs. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

The two statements are the same mathematically. The Lean version is a direct formalization of the natural language claim, even slightly more general by being universally quantified (which is standard and faithful). No differences or extra assumptions are present.

- `(K : Set X)`: There is a subset K of X.
- `(hK : @IsCompact X tX K)`: K is compact in X (with topology tX). This matches “there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X”.

- `(ht : tY = TopologicalSpace.coinduced f tX)`: The topology on Y is the coinduced topology from f and tX; i.e., Y is endowed with the quotient topology making f continuous. This matches “Y is compact in the quotient topology”.
- `@IsCompact Y tY (Set.univ : Set Y)`: The conclusion is that the entire space Y (i.e., univ) is compact under tY. In mathlib, “Y is compact” is precisely `IsCompact (Set.univ : Set Y)`, so this matches the desired conclusion.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statement captures exactly the hypotheses and conclusion of the natural language statement: surjective f, existence of a compact K with f(K) = Y, and Y equipped with the coinduced (quotient) topology. The conclusion asserts Y is compact under that topology.
- The hypothesis `hf : Surjective f` is redundant given `f '' K = univ`, but the natural language also states surjectivity, so including it is fine and faithful.
- All concepts are standard mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace, IsCompact, coinduced, image, univ). There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions.
- The use of `IsCompact univ` is the standard way to state that Y is compact. This is equivalent to saying Y is a compact space.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: n : ℕ, S : Set (Fin n → ℝ) (so S ⊆ ℝ^n), and x y : ℝ^n.
- Hypothesis (commented as “whenever there exists a continuous path from x to y avoiding S”):
  ∃ γ : ℝ → ℝ^n, ContinuousOn γ on Icc 0 1, γ 0 = x, γ 1 = y, and range γ ⊆ univ \ S.
  In words: there exists a curve γ defined on all of ℝ that is continuous on [0,1], joins x to y at parameters 0 and 1, and such that every value γ t for all real t lies in the complement of S. Note: this is stronger than the usual notion of a path on [0,1] avoiding S, since it requires the entire range over ℝ to avoid S, not just the image on [0,1].
- Conclusion: ∃ m : ℕ, ∃ v : Fin (m+1) → ℝ^n, ∀ i, v i ∈ S.
  In words: there exist finitely many points v₀,…,v_m, all lying in S. There is no relation stated between these points and any path, nor any statement about segments or polygonal structure, nor any avoidance property or length minimization.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original statement asserts: Among paths in ℝ^n \ S from x to y, a shortest path (when such a shortest path exists) can be taken to be a polygon whose corners lie on S. This involves notions of path length/shortest (geodesic in the obstacle-avoiding class), polygonality (piecewise linear in ℝ^n \ S), and the property that vertices lie on S.
- The Lean statement does not mention length, shortest paths, polygonal or piecewise linear paths, or even that the polygonal segments lie in ℝ^n \ S. It does not even produce a path, only a finite list of points in S, with no connection to x, y, or any path.
- The hypothesis is also misaligned: it assumes existence of a continuous path on [0,1] but requires avoidance of S for the entire ℝ-domain of γ (range γ), which is stronger than necessary. The original premise “whenever this makes sense” is about the existence of a shortest path in the class of S-avoiding paths; the code only assumes existence of some continuous S-avoiding path and then claims a conclusion unrelated to shortestness.
- Therefore the code is not a faithful formalization. It omits essential concepts (length, minimality, polygonality, edges avoiding S) and adds an unrelated existential about points of S with no link to the path.

Final check: The two math problems are different. Differences:
- Original: existence and structure of a shortest path (minimal length) in ℝ^n \ S that is polygonal with vertices on S.
- Lean: from existence of a continuous path (with an overly strong avoidance condition), conclude the existence of finitely many points in S, with no relation to a path, polygonal structure, or shortestness.
- Also, the domain handling (range over ℝ vs image on [0,1]) is incorrect.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

- `def is_covering_map (f : X → Y) : Prop := True`: This defines a predicate ""is_covering_map"" on functions as the proposition True. In natural language: every function is (by definition) a covering map. This is an explicit placeholder and not the genuine topological definition.

The proof is omitted.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The intended statement: If X → Y and Y → Z are covering maps (in the standard topological sense), then the composition X → Z is a covering map. This is a standard closure property for covering maps.
- The code uses a vacuous placeholder `is_covering_map := True`, so it does not capture the real notion of covering map at all. As a result, the theorem becomes trivial and does not assert the genuine topological property.
- The code does not use any Mathlib definitions related to covering maps (nor does Mathlib necessarily have a fully developed covering map structure, but a faithful translation would need to define the correct topological predicate, not `True`). This is a red flag per the guidelines.
- There are no other auxiliary definitions besides the vacuous predicate; the theorem’s statement shape matches the intended closure under composition, but because the predicate is vacuous, the translation is not faithful.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code asserts composition preserves a trivially true predicate, whereas the natural language statement is about the genuine covering map property. Therefore, they are different.

Given the rubric: The code makes a vacuous definition; if that were replaced by a faithful definition of covering map, the theorem statement would match the natural language claim. Hence this fits the case where vacuous definitions exist but the final theorem’s shape would be faithful if fixed.

    (x0 : X) (y0 : Y) :
    pi1 (X × Y) (x0, y0) ≃ pi1 X x0 × pi1 Y y0 := by sorry
  Natural language: Assert that there is a type equivalence between pi1 of the product space (with product basepoint) and the product of pi1(X, x0) and pi1(Y, y0). With the placeholder definition, this reads: there is an equivalence PUnit ≃ (PUnit × PUnit). The proof is omitted (sorry). The statement uses type equivalence (≃), not a group isomorphism.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement
Original: Let X and Y be topological spaces with basepoints x0∈X and y0∈Y. Prove that π1(X×Y,(x0,y0)) ≅ π1(X,x0) × π1(Y,y0).
- The original is a statement about an isomorphism of fundamental groups (i.e., as groups), not merely an equivalence of underlying types.
- The code defines pi1 as PUnit, a vacuous placeholder. This is not Mathlib’s fundamental group and destroys the intended meaning. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- The result in code is a type equivalence (≃), not a group isomorphism (e.g., ≃* or a GroupCat isomorphism). Even if pi1 were the correct group, the correct formalization should express a group isomorphism, not just a type equivalence.
- Because pi1 is defined as PUnit, the statement reduces to PUnit ≃ PUnit × PUnit, which is trivially true and bears no relation to the genuine topological result.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Fundamental group replaced by a trivial type (PUnit): major mismatch.
- Missing group structure and isomorphism: the code uses a type equivalence rather than a group isomorphism.
- Uses a placeholder rather than Mathlib’s π₁ construction: not the latest/applicable Mathlib terms.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a legitimate, faithful translation of the natural language theorem.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

  (Xφ : Type*) (pφ : Xφ → X) (action : Γ → Xφ → Xφ) :
  is_Gamma_covering (pφ : Xφ → X) := by sorry
  This states: Given any topological space X, group Γ, another group π1X (just an arbitrary group type, not tied to X’s fundamental group), a function φ : π1X → Γ (not a group homomorphism type), a type Xφ, a map pφ : Xφ → X, and a function action : Γ → Xφ → Xφ (not declared as a group action), then pφ is a Γ-covering in the sense of is_Gamma_covering. Since is_Gamma_covering is defined as True, this is a vacuous claim. There are no hypotheses of path connectedness or local simple connectedness; no relation between π1X and X; no requirement that φ is a homomorphism; no structure that Xφ carries a Γ-action; no claim about Γ ≃ π1(X); and no classification statement for all connected Γ-coverings.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement asserts two substantive facts:
- Construction: Given X path connected and locally simply connected, a group Γ, and a group morphism φ : π1(X) → Γ, and a Γ-action on Xφ producing pφ : Xφ → X, then pφ is a Γ-covering and moreover Γ ≅ π1(X). (Even this phrasing is a bit unusual: usually one gets a covering corresponding to a subgroup or a quotient via φ, not necessarily Γ ≅ π1(X), but we take the user statement as given.)
- Classification: Any connected Γ-covering Y → X arises from such a construction for some φ.
The Lean code does not encode any of these: it lacks the hypotheses (path connected, locally simply connected), lacks the correct fundamental group object tied to X, lacks a homomorphism structure for φ, lacks a Γ-action structure, lacks the isomorphism claim Γ ≃ π1(X), and completely omits the universal classification clause about any connected Γ-covering arising from this construction. It asserts only a vacuous predicate on pφ, which is always true.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
They are different. The code:
- Uses a vacuous definition is_Gamma_covering := True.
- Does not mention or enforce path connectedness, local simple connectedness, or connectedness of the covering.
- Treats π1X as an arbitrary group unrelated to X; φ is just a function, not a homomorphism.
- Does not assert Γ ≃ π1(X) or any classification correspondence.
- Omits the “any connected Γ-covering Y → X comes from this construction” part entirely.
Given the vacuous predicate and the lack of essential structure, this is not a faithful translation.

Auxiliary definitions check:
- is_Gamma_covering is vacuous (:= True), violating the guidelines.
- No Mathlib fundamental group or covering space structures are used.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: Let X be a topological space and n ∈ ℕ. Suppose f,g : X → ℝ^n are continuous. Then f+g : X → ℝ^n is continuous.
- The Lean code models ℝ^n as `(Fin n → ℝ)`, which is the canonical representation in mathlib. The assumptions (X topological space, n ∈ ℕ, f and g continuous) and the conclusion (f+g is continuous) match exactly.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions as long as the statement is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:

- Continuity assumptions and conclusion: identical.
- Edge case n = 0 is included in both formulations and is standard; no conflict.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let f : X → Y be surjective. Suppose there exists a compact K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Equip Y with the quotient topology induced by f. Prove Y is compact.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes: with Y carrying the coinduced (quotient) topology from f, Y (i.e., univ) is compact, assuming f is surjective and there exists K compact with f '' K = univ. It uses IsCompact univ under the explicit coinduced topology, which is the standard way in mathlib to assert the space is compact without introducing a CompactSpace instance.
- The inclusion of hf (surjective) is consistent with the NL statement; himage already implies surjectivity, so hf is redundant but not contradictory. The theorem is parametric in K with the properties, which is stronger than the existential assumption and thus faithful to the intended statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; all notions (coinduced topology, IsCompact, image equality) are standard mathlib.

- It considers a smooth map f : M → M' with hf : ContMDiff I I' (⊤) f, i.e., f is C^∞ (smooth).
- It assumes a strict inequality of dimensions encoded as h_dim : Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E'. This corresponds to dim(M) < dim(M').
- The theorem statement: IsNowhereDense (range f). That is, the image of f is a nowhere dense subset of M'.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- NL statement: For a smooth map φ : P → Q between manifolds with dim P = dim Q, there is a dense set of points p₀ ∈ P such that φ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of each such p₀.
- Code statement: For a smooth map f : M → M' with dim M < dim M', the image of f is nowhere dense in M'.
- These concern entirely different properties:
  - NL: equal dimensions, property about local diffeomorphism at a dense set of source points.
  - Lean: strict dimension inequality, property about topological smallness (nowhere dense) of the image in the target.

Step 3: Final check — Same or different?
- Different dimensions: NL uses dim equality; Lean uses strict inequality.
- Different conclusions: NL asserts existence of a dense subset of P where f is a local diffeomorphism. Lean asserts the image range f is nowhere dense in M'.

- The natural statement speaks about: X being path connected and locally simply connected; p : C → X a covering map; f a deck transformation, i.e., a homeomorphism C ≃ₜ C with p ∘ f = p; γ a path in X; tildeγ a lift of γ; conclusion: f ∘ tildeγ is also a lift of γ (i.e., p ∘ (f ∘ tildeγ) = γ).
- Major mismatches:
  - Path connectedness and locally simply connectedness: in the code they are mere arbitrary Props, not linked to X, and unused; they do not use Mathlib notions (e.g., `PathConnectedSpace X`) or any local simple connectivity concept.
  - Covering map and deck transformation: the code does not define or assume `p` is a covering map; `f` is not a homeomorphism (`Homeomorph C C`) nor even continuous—just a function with `p ∘ f = p`.
  - Path vs arbitrary function: `γ : Y → X` and `tildeγ : Y → C` are arbitrary functions; no domain interval, continuity, or `Path` structure from Mathlib.
  - The statement proved is a trivial compositional equality that holds in far greater generality than intended and does not capture the topological content or the definitions used in the natural statement.

The Lean code states a purely algebraic fact about functions under `p ∘ f = p` and `p ∘ tildeγ = γ`, with no topological or homeomorphic structure, and with unused placeholder Props. The natural statement requires deck transformations (homeomorphisms commuting with p) and paths/lifts in the covering space context, and mentions path connected and locally simply connected spaces.

  • Eigenvalues with inequalities > 1 and < −1 → expressed via existence of eigenpairs with nonzero eigenvectors and the respective inequalities.
  • Conclusion that A (as a function) is a covering map → `IsCoveringMap` predicate.
- The representation of ℝ^n as `(Fin n → ℝ)` is standard and faithful. Requiring explicit eigenvectors is the usual way to formalize existence of eigenvalues over ℝ.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous assumptions are added; no assumptions from the NL statement are dropped.
- The use of linear equivalence (invertible linear map) precisely captures ""invertible matrix"" at the level of linear maps. The eigenvalue conditions are correctly stated over ℝ with strict inequalities and nonzero eigenvectors.
- The conclusion uses a standard Mathlib predicate name (`IsCoveringMap`) for being a covering map. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The proof is omitted but irrelevant to translation fidelity.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem universal_cover_unique_up_to_iso {X Y Z : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z] {f : X → Y} {g : Z → Y}`: We have topological spaces X, Y, Z with continuous maps f: X → Y and g: Z → Y.
- `(hf : IsCoveringMap f) (hg : IsCoveringMap g)`: f and g are covering maps.
- `(hX : SimplyConnectedSpace X) (hZ : SimplyConnectedSpace Z)`: X and Z are simply connected spaces.
- `: ∃! (h : Homeomorph X Z), g ∘ (h : X → Z) = f`: There exists a unique homeomorphism h: X ≃ Z such that g ∘ h = f; i.e., the triangle X --h→ Z --g→ Y equals X --f→ Y commutes, and among homeomorphisms over Y, h is unique.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement assumes X → Y and Z → Y are universal covering maps. In standard usage, a universal covering map is a covering map whose total space is simply connected. The Lean code encodes exactly this by assuming IsCoveringMap f, IsCoveringMap g, and SimplyConnectedSpace X, SimplyConnectedSpace Z. So the hypotheses align with a common formalization of “universal covering maps.”
- The NL conclusion: “X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y, i.e. there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle commute.” Interpreting “isomorphic as a covering” means: there is a homeomorphism h: X ≃ Z such that g ∘ h = f. The Lean statement asserts existence—and moreover uniqueness—of a homeomorphism h with g ∘ h = f. This matches the isomorphism-over-Y phrasing and adds uniqueness, consistent with the NL’s “unique map” clause.

3) Comparison and potential differences:
- The Lean statement’s uniqueness quantifies over homeomorphisms (isomorphisms of topological spaces), while the NL phrasing says “unique map.” Given that the first part says “isomorphic,” it is natural to interpret the “unique map” as “unique isomorphism over Y.” So the Lean formalization is in line with that reading. If one took “unique map” to mean among all continuous maps, Lean’s statement is slightly narrower (uniqueness among homeomorphisms). However in the context of “isomorphic as coverings,” the intended uniqueness is for isomorphisms, so this is not a substantive mismatch.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (IsCoveringMap, SimplyConnectedSpace, Homeomorph) are standard Mathlib terms. The code is a direct theorem statement mirroring the NL claim.

Final check: The Lean code faithfully encodes the hypothesis and the intended conclusion (existence and uniqueness of an isomorphism over Y). The only subtlety is the word “map” vs “homeomorphism,” but given the “isomorphic as a covering” preface, this is a reasonable and faithful formalization.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language
- structure CoveringMap (X Y) with fields:
  - to_fun : X → Y (the projection map)
  - is_covering : Prop (a bare proposition asserting it is a covering map; no definition)
  - basepoint : X (chosen basepoint x₀ in X)
  - targetpoint : Y (chosen basepoint y₀ in Y)
  - is_universal : Prop (a bare proposition asserting the map is universal; no definition)
  This is a very minimal, largely uninterpreted encoding. There is no topology or covering-space structure built in.

- structure Morphism f g between covering maps f : CoveringMap X Y and g : CoveringMap Z Y with:
  - map : X → Z (a map of total spaces)
  - map_basepoint : map f.basepoint = g.basepoint (preserves basepoints in the total spaces)
  - commute : g.to_fun ∘ map = f.to_fun (commutes with the projections to Y)
  This encodes a morphism of coverings over Y that preserves basepoints on the total spaces. There is no mention of the basepoint in Y being the same, and no topological hypotheses.

- The theorem universal_covering_map_iff_unique_factor:
  For any f : CoveringMap X Y, we assert
  f.is_universal ↔ (∀ {Z} (g : CoveringMap Z Y), ∃! (h : Morphism f g), True).
  This states: f is universal if and only if, for every covering map g over the same base Y, there exists exactly one Morphism f → g. The predicate in the unique-existence is True, so this means ""there exists exactly one element of the type Morphism f g."" No assumptions about Hausdorffness, about Y admitting a universal cover, or even that f and g actually satisfy is_covering are used in the statement.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: Suppose Y is a Hausdorff topological space which admits a universal covering space. Prove that a covering map (X,x₀) → (Y,y₀) is universal iff every covering map (Z,z₀) → (Y,y₀) has a unique morphism (X,x₀) → (Z,z₀).

Key components of the original:
- Y is a Hausdorff topological space.
- Y admits a universal covering space (existence assumption).
- We work with pointed coverings over the same basepoint y₀ in Y.
- The universality of (X,x₀) → (Y,y₀) is equivalent to the unique-lifting/unique-morphism property to any other pointed covering (Z,z₀) → (Y,y₀).

What the Lean code includes or omits:
- No TopologicalSpace instance on X or Y, no Hausdorff assumption, and no mention of Y admitting a universal cover. These assumptions are entirely missing.
- is_covering and is_universal are bare Props with no definitions linking them to topology; the theorem does not demand or use is_covering anywhere. This is effectively a placeholder encoding.
- Pointedness: The structure includes basepoint : X and targetpoint : Y, but the theorem does not require that any g has the same targetpoint as f, i.e., it does not enforce that all coverings considered are over the same basepoint y₀ in Y. The Morphism only requires preservation of the total-space basepoints and commutation over Y, but the common y₀ condition is not encoded or invoked.
- The theorem states the universal property as an equivalence with is_universal, but is_universal itself is an uninterpreted Prop; there is no connection made in the code between is_universal and the unique morphism property beyond this theorem's assertion.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two statements the same?
They are different.
- Missing hypotheses: The Lean statement omits that Y is Hausdorff and that Y admits a universal covering space.
- Missing constraints: It does not restrict to coverings over the same basepoint y₀ in Y (no requirement that g.targetpoint = f.targetpoint), which is required in the original pointed setting.
- Uninterpreted placeholders: is_covering and is_universal are not defined via Mathlib concepts or any meaningful structure; the theorem does not even assume f.is_covering or g.is_covering in its statement.
- The category-theoretic notion of morphism is approximated, but the essential topological content and the crucial assumptions are absent.

Because of these gaps, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language theorem. It uses vacuous/placeholder fields, omits the stated hypotheses, and does not enforce the pointed basepoint condition on Y across all coverings.

Grade rationale:
- Significant omissions (Hausdorff, existence of universal cover, basepoint-on-Y alignment) and placeholder Props make this unfaithful. However, the shape of the final equivalence mirrors the intended universal property of covering maps, so if the placeholders were replaced by proper definitions and the missing assumptions added, the statement could be made faithful. This matches the rubric level where vacuous definitions are present but fixable to yield a faithful statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: imports the Mathlib library.
- Comment: says the goal is to formalize that for continuous maps f,g,h : unit interval → X, the condition that both concatenations (f*g)*h and f*(g*h) are defined reduces to the same endpoint equalities, and that ""defined"" is formalized as the conjunction f(1)=g(0) and g(1)=h(0).

  This declares a topological space X and continuous maps f,g,h from the unit interval to X, and then states the logical equivalence between the exact same conjunction of endpoint equalities on both sides: (f(1)=g(0) ∧ g(1)=h(0)) ↔ (f(1)=g(0) ∧ g(1)=h(0)). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement has two parts:
  (a) Associativity up to homotopy rel {0,1}: (x*y)*z is homotopic relative to endpoints to x*(y*z).
  (b) Definedness equivalence: (x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.
- The Lean code addresses neither concatenation nor homotopy. It does not define or reference concatenation `*`, nor homotopy relative to {0,1}. It only states a tautology about endpoint equalities, and even the “definedness” part is not expressed as a comparison between the conditions for (f*g)*h vs f*(g*h); instead it states p ↔ p with the exact same formula on both sides. There is no predicate or definition introduced for ""defined"" or concatenation.
- Consequently, the core associativity-up-to-homotopy claim is entirely missing, and even the definedness equivalence is not properly formalized (it should compare the condition for (f*g)*h to be defined to the condition for f*(g*h) to be defined). The code only asserts a trivial tautology that does not mention concatenation at all.

3) Final comparison:
- Different. The Lean theorem is a tautology about endpoint equalities and does not formalize homotopy or concatenation, nor does it explicitly tie the endpoint equalities to the definedness of the two different concatenations. It therefore fails to translate the original statement in both substance and structure.
- Additional note: The proof uses `sorry`, which is acceptable for a statement-only audit, but the absence of any proper definitions or references to the actual concepts is the primary issue.

Given the above, the translation is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: Given Y with the final topology from a family of maps f_i : X_i → Y (i ∈ I), prove that Y is Hausdorff iff there exists a space X and a map P : X → Y that ""includes"" all the f_i (i.e., they factor through P), and P is injective.
- The second theorem in the code matches this structure closely by choosing the canonical choice X = Σ i, X_i and P(i, x) = f_i x, and stating “Y is T2 with the coinduced topology from P iff P is injective.” This captures “includes all f_i” via the sigma aggregator.
- A minor mismatch: The natural language presumes each X_i is a topological space and Y has the final topology from the family (meaning the sigma space carries the standard coproduct topology from the X_i). The code instead quantifies over an arbitrary topology t on Σ i, X_i i rather than explicitly building it from individual topologies on each X_i. However, this is a generalization: specializing t to the coproduct topology recovers exactly the intended setting. The statement is thus faithful as a generalization.
- The first theorem is an even more general statement (for any X and P) and is not required by the original claim, but its presence does not invalidate the translation; it’s an extraneous generalization. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; all terms are standard Mathlib.

3) Final comparison:
- The core claim “Y is Hausdorff under the final topology from the family iff the canonical P is injective” is expressed in the second theorem. It matches the original statement modulo the minor generalization of allowing an arbitrary topology on the sigma space (which contains the coproduct topology case). The code uses appropriate Mathlib notions (coinduced, T2Space, Function.Injective). No auxiliary vacuous definitions.
- Small differences: (i) the code does not explicitly assert that the sigma topology is the coproduct of topologies on the X_i; instead it treats an arbitrary t on the sigma space, which strictly generalizes the setup; (ii) there is an additional more general theorem not demanded by the statement. These do not change the essential meaning of the main claim.

Given the above, the translation is essentially faithful, with a slight generalization and an extra theorem. Hence, high score but not perfect.

- def fiber (f : X → Y) (y0 : Y) : Type u := { x : X // f x = y0 }: The fiber over y0 as a subtype. This part is reasonable.
- def pi (n : ℕ) (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z) : Type u := Z: Defines “π_n(Z, z0)” to be the underlying type Z. This is a placeholder and not the homotopy group; it ignores basepoints and group structure.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The original statement asserts: for a Serre fibration f : X → Y, the induced maps on homotopy groups π_n(F, x0) → π_n(X, x0) → π_n(Y, y0) form a long exact sequence … → π_n(F, x0) → π_n(X, x0) → π_n(Y, y0) → π_{n-1}(F, x0) → …, where F is the fiber over y0 and x0 ∈ F (so f x0 = y0).
The code:
- Uses a vacuous definition of SerreFibration (equivalent to True), so every map qualifies.
- Uses a vacuous definition of π_n (equal to the underlying type), so it is not homotopy groups.
- The theorem statement does not even attempt to express a long exact sequence; it asserts True and is proved by sorry.
- No condition relating x0 and y0 (x0 ∈ fiber over y0) is included.
- No exactness, maps, or sequences are mentioned in the formal statement.
Therefore, the code does not formalize the content of the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check
The math problems are different. The Lean code provides a vacuous placeholder: a trivial proposition True with dummy definitions. It neither states nor implies the existence of the long exact sequence, does not define the correct objects (homotopy groups), and fails to assert the needed relationships (x0 over y0, exactness, sequence). Multiple auxiliary definitions are vacuous, and even if those were fixed, the final theorem still only claims True, so it would remain unfaithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y Z : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z]`: X, Y, Z are topological spaces.
- `[T2Space X]`: X is Hausdorff.
- `(f : X → Y)`: f is a function from X to Y.
- `(IsCoveringMap : (X → Y) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate on maps X → Y to stand in for ""is a covering map"" (not Mathlib’s actual definition).
- `(hf : IsCoveringMap f)`: Assumes f satisfies this predicate (i.e., f is a covering map in this abstract sense).
- The theorem `covering_map_lift_unique`: For maps `g1 g2 : Z → X`, with hypotheses: `Continuous g1`, `Continuous g2`, equality `f (g1 z) = f (g2 z)` for all z, a point `z0 : Z` with `g1 z0 = g2 z0`, and `ConnectedSpace Z`, we conclude `g1 = g2`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: Let f be a covering map from Hausdorff X to Y. If g1, g2 : Z → X satisfy f ∘ g1 = f ∘ g2 for all z, and g1(z0) = g2(z0) for some z0, then g1 = g2. No continuity of g1, g2 is assumed, and no connectedness of Z is assumed.
- Lean theorem adds significant extra hypotheses: g1 and g2 must be continuous, and Z must be connected. These are not in the NL statement. This is a stricter, different statement.
- The code uses an abstract predicate `IsCoveringMap` instead of Mathlib’s covering map notion. This is not a faithful use of Mathlib terms and weakens the semantic connection to ""covering map""; however, the more critical issue is the added continuity and connectedness assumptions.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same: the Lean code requires continuity of the lifts and connectedness of Z, which the NL statement does not. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Other red flags:
- Not using Mathlib’s covering map definition, but an arbitrary predicate `IsCoveringMap`.
- The proof is `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task as we're judging the statement, but it underscores that no properties of covering maps are actually used.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem continuous_iff_closure_preimage_eq_preimage_closure {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] {f : X → Y} :` declares a theorem for types X and Y equipped with topological space structures and a function f : X → Y.
- `Continuous f ↔ ∀ (A : Set Y), closure (f ⁻¹' A) = f ⁻¹' (closure A)` states the equivalence: f is continuous if and only if for every subset A of Y, the closure in X of the preimage of A equals the preimage under f of the closure of A in Y.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing guidelines that focus on the statement, not the proof.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
The natural language says: For a map f : X → Y between topological spaces, f is continuous if and only if for every subset A ⊆ Y one has cl(f^{-1}(A)) = f^{-1}(cl(A)). This matches exactly the formal Lean statement: same domains (topological spaces), same function, an if-and-only-if, same universal quantification over all subsets A of Y, and the same equality of closures and preimages (with closure taken in the appropriate spaces).

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.
- The Mathlib notions used (`TopologicalSpace`, `Continuous`, `closure`, preimage notation) are standard and appropriate.
- The statement is exactly the same as the natural language statement. There are no differences in quantifiers, spaces, or operations.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- The module imports Mathlib and opens Topology.
- It fixes a topological space X.
- The theorem statement:
  • Inputs: a basepoint x0 : X; a hypothesis hpath : PathConnectedSpace X (path connectedness); a hypothesis hlocal : ∀ x : X, True (explicitly marked as a placeholder for locally simply connected); a subgroup Γ : Subgroup (FundamentalGroup X x0).
  • Conclusion: there exist a type XΓ with a TopologicalSpace structure, a map p : XΓ → X, a proof that p is a covering map (IsCoveringMap p), and a point xΓ : XΓ, such that: (1) XΓ is connected (formulated as IsConnected (univ : Set XΓ)); and (2) the image of the induced map on fundamental groups Subgroup.range (FundamentalGroup.map p xΓ x0) equals Γ.
- The proof is omitted with sorry (allowed per instructions for translation auditing).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original statement: For a path connected and locally simply connected space X and a subgroup Γ ⊆ π₁(X), there exists a connected covering p : X_Γ → X whose induced map on π₁ has image Γ, and this covering is unique up to unique isomorphism of coverings.

What the Lean statement attempts to assert:
- Existence: A covering p : XΓ → X with connected total space, and image of π₁ equals Γ. This part aligns in spirit.
- Assumptions on X: Path connectedness is stated (hpath). However, “locally simply connected” is replaced by the vacuous hypothesis hlocal : ∀ x, True. This is an explicit placeholder and imposes no condition on X. Thus the theorem claims the existence result without the required local simple connectivity assumption. This is not faithful.
- Basepoints: The statement uses FundamentalGroup.map p xΓ x0. In algebraic topology, the induced map on π₁ depends on basepoints and usually requires p xΓ = x0 (or a choice of path between them). The theorem does not state p xΓ = x0 or provide a path, so the induced map is under-specified. This is another mismatch with the usual precise formulation “p_*: π₁(XΓ, xΓ) → π₁(X, x0)” where p(xΓ) = x0.
- Uniqueness: The original statement asserts uniqueness up to unique isomorphism of coverings. The Lean statement contains no uniqueness clause at all; it only asserts existence.

Step 3: Final check — are the two statements the same?
They are different for multiple reasons:
- The locally simply connected hypothesis is missing and replaced by a vacuous placeholder (∀ x, True), making the theorem much stronger than intended and not a faithful translation.
- The uniqueness up to unique isomorphism is completely omitted.
- The basepoint compatibility p xΓ = x0 (or path data) is not included but is needed to define the induced map on fundamental groups precisely; the code references FundamentalGroup.map p xΓ x0 without expressing this requirement.
- Although the connectivity and image-of-π₁ parts are in the right direction, the above issues make the translation unfaithful.

Given these discrepancies, the translation fails the audit: it uses a vacuous placeholder for a crucial hypothesis and omits the uniqueness part.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `universe u`: Universe declaration.
- `theorem fundamental_group_conjugation_isomorphism {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] {x0 x1 : X} (p : Path x0 x1) : MulEquiv (FundamentalGroup X x0) (FundamentalGroup X x1) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a topological space X, points x0, x1 in X, and a path p from x0 to x1, there is a group isomorphism (a multiplicative equivalence) between the fundamental groups π1(X, x0) and π1(X, x1).

Assessment of whether it matches the original statement:
- The original statement specifies a very particular map: given a path x from x0 to x1, it sends a loop class [y] in π1(X, x0) to the loop class [x̄ * (y * x)] in π1(X, x1), and claims this assignment is a group isomorphism.
- The Lean code only asserts the existence (indeed, constructs some specific element of MulEquiv) of an isomorphism between π1(X, x0) and π1(X, x1) given a path p, but it does not specify that the isomorphism is precisely the conjugation map [y] ↦ [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)]. It doesn’t mention loops, reversal, or concatenation.
- Therefore, while the Lean statement is a standard consequence of the natural language statement, it is weaker/less specific: it does not encode the explicit formula for the induced isomorphism. The theorem name suggests conjugation, but names are not part of the formal content.

Other checks:
- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced. The objects used (Path, FundamentalGroup, MulEquiv) are standard Mathlib notions.
- The use of `sorry` is acceptable for our task, which audits the statement rather than the proof.

Final comparison:
- The two statements are not the same. The natural language requires the specific conjugation-by-path map to be the isomorphism. The Lean code merely asserts there exists an isomorphism (or provides some isomorphism) without specifying it is that conjugation map. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Almost correct in spirit (existence of a path-induced isomorphism) but missing the critical explicit description of the map required by the problem. No vacuous placeholders. This warrants a high but non-passing grade.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib definitions and theorems.
- open MulAction Set: Opens namespaces to use MulAction and Set notation.
- variable (Γ : Type*) [Group Γ]: Γ is a type with a group structure.
- variable (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X]: X is a type with a topology.
- variable [MulAction Γ X]: Γ acts on X (abstract group action).

The main theorem:
- theorem compact_orbit_space_implies_compact_stabilizer_and_compact_fundamental_set
  {Γ : Type*} [Group Γ] [TopologicalSpace Γ] [IsTopologicalGroup Γ]
  {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [MulAction Γ X] [ContinuousSMul Γ X]

  ∃ (K : Set X), IsCompact K ∧ ∀ x : X, (K ∩ MulAction.orbit Γ x).Nonempty := by sorry

Natural language unpacking of the theorem statement:
- Assumptions:
  - Γ is a group with a topology, and in fact a topological group ([IsTopologicalGroup Γ]).
  - X is a topological space with a continuous action of Γ ([ContinuousSMul Γ X]).
  - The orbit space X/Γ, modeled as the quotient by the orbit equivalence relation, is compact as a topological space (CompactSpace (Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X))).
- Conclusions:
  1) For every x ∈ X, there exists y in the orbit Γ·x such that the stabilizer subgroup Stab_Γ(y) is compact as a subset of Γ.
  2) There exists a compact set K ⊆ X that intersects every Γ-orbit: for all x, K ∩ (Γ·x) is nonempty.

There are no auxiliary fake definitions; all objects (orbit, stabilizer, quotient, IsCompact) are standard Mathlib notions.

Step 2: Compare with the original natural language statement
Original: ""If a group Γ acts on a topological space X and X/Γ is compact, prove that every orbit Γ x ⊆ X contains a point x with compact stabilizer, and moreover that X contains a compact set intersecting every Γ-orbit.""
- The conclusions in Lean match exactly:
  - Existence of a point with compact stabilizer in each orbit.
  - Existence of a compact subset meeting every orbit.
- The hypothesis about the compactness of X/Γ matches: CompactSpace (Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X)).

Step 3: Check for mismatches
- The Lean code imposes strictly stronger hypotheses than stated:
  - It requires Γ to be a topological group ([TopologicalSpace Γ] and [IsTopologicalGroup Γ]).
  - It requires the action to be continuous ([ContinuousSMul Γ X]).
- The natural language statement only says ""a group Γ acts on a topological space X"" with no explicit topology on Γ nor continuity of the action. However, it then speaks of ""compact stabilizer"" (a subset of Γ), which implicitly requires a topology on Γ to make sense. Minimal extra assumption to formalize this would be a topology on Γ; the code goes further by requiring a topological group structure and continuity of the action.
- Therefore, while the conclusions are right, the Lean theorem is not a faithful translation if we take the NL statement literally, because it adds additional (stronger) structure beyond what is minimally needed or stated.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are legitimate Mathlib constructs.

Final judgment: Almost faithful in content, but not exact due to stronger hypotheses (topological group + continuous action), so it does not strictly match the original statement.

  Let X be a topological space, and let A and U be subsets of X.

- `theorem closure_inter_subset_closure_inter_closure : closure (A ∩ U) ⊆ closure A ∩ closure U := by sorry`:
  This states the general inclusion: the closure of A ∩ U is contained in the intersection of the closures, i.e., cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ cl(U). No hypothesis on U being open or closed.

- `theorem closure_inter_subset_closure_inter_of_closed (hU : IsClosed (U : Set X)) : closure (A ∩ U) ⊆ closure A ∩ U := by sorry`:
  This states: if U is closed, then cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ U. This relies on U being closed so that cl(U) = U.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: For any subset A ⊆ X and open set U ⊆ X, prove cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ U.
- The Lean code does not assert this. Instead, it asserts:
  - The always-true general inclusion cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ cl(U) (no openness/closedness required).
  - A refined inclusion cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ U under the assumption that U is closed (not open).

3) Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The requested statement assumes U is open and concludes cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ U. This is generally false for open U (counterexample: in R, A = (1/2, 3/2), U = (0,1); then cl(A ∩ U) = [1/2,1] but cl(A) ∩ U = (1/2,1)).
- The Lean code provides a correct general inclusion with cl(U) on the right, and then a correct specialization when U is closed (not open). Thus, the Lean statements are different in hypothesis and conclusion from the NL claim and do not translate it.

4) Auxiliary definitions check:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only theorem statements (with sorry proofs). No vacuous definitions like `:= True` etc. However, faithfulness is judged on matching the NL statement, which fails here.

Conclusion: The Lean code does not faithfully translate the NL statement. It asserts different theorems (one general, one for closed U) rather than the claimed (and in fact false) open-set version.

  - f, g : X → Y are maps.
  - h : Homotopy f g asserts that f and g are homotopic (in mathlib, this entails a continuous homotopy between them, so f and g are continuous).
  - hf : f x0 = y0 and hg : g x0 = y0 are the basepoint conditions at the endpoints.

- Section variables: {Γ} [Group Γ], {Y} [TopologicalSpace Y] [MulAction Γ Y] [SimplyConnectedSpace Y], and a parameter h_loc : LocallySimplyConnectedSpace Y.

Issues in translation:
- CoveringAction is defined as True (vacuous). It does not encode properly discontinuous, free, nor that the quotient map is a covering map. This violates the requirement to faithfully represent the assumptions.
- LocallySimplyConnectedSpace is defined as True (vacuous), so the local simple connectivity assumption is also not encoded.
- Missing Hausdorff assumption: The original explicitly requires Y to be Hausdorff; the code does not include [T2Space Y] or equivalent.
- Topology on X: The code assumes an arbitrary [TopologicalSpace (X)], not necessarily the quotient topology. The original refers to the quotient space Γ\Y with its quotient topology.
- Universal covering map: The code concludes IsCoveringMap p, and since [SimplyConnectedSpace Y] is an assumption, this is close to “p is a universal covering map,” but it does not explicitly assert universality; still, IsCoveringMap together with simply connected domain is typically equivalent to “universal covering.” This part is acceptable only if the other assumptions are faithful, which they are not.
- Group isomorphism type: The conclusion uses (FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃ Γ), which is a type equivalence, not a group isomorphism (MulEquiv ≃*). The statement claims a group isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ, so the correct Lean counterpart should be (FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* Γ). Using ≃ is strictly weaker and not faithful.

Step 3: Final check
- Multiple vacuous placeholders (CoveringAction, LocallySimplyConnectedSpace) violate the requirements.
- The Hausdorff assumption is omitted.
- The topology on the quotient is not specified to be the quotient topology.
- The isomorphism asserted is a type equivalence, not a group isomorphism.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- The comment block describes (informally) a version of van Kampen's theorem, but comments are not code and do not enforce any content.
- `theorem van_kampen_amalgam {X : Type} [TopologicalSpace X] {ι : Type} (x0 : X) (U : ι → Set X) (h_cover : (⋃ i, U i) = (Set.univ : Set X)) (h_open : ∀ i, IsOpen (U i)) (h_contains : ∀ i, x0 ∈ U i) (π : Type) (π_i : ι → Type) (π_ij : ι → ι → Type) : True := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any topological space X, any index type ι, a basepoint x0 in X, and a family of open sets U i covering X and each containing x0; and for any types π, π_i, π_ij, we assert True. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement is the van Kampen theorem: for a path connected, locally simply connected X, with a cover by path connected open sets whose pairwise intersections are path connected and all contain x0, letting π = π1(X, x0), π_a = π1(X_a, x0), π_ab = π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0), we have π is the amalgamated free product of the π_a over the π_ab.
- The Lean code does not encode:
  - Path connectedness of X or of U_i and U_i ∩ U_j.
  - Local simple connectedness of X.
  - The fundamental group π1 or any group structure at all; π, π_i, π_ij are arbitrary types, not groups, not π1.
  - Inclusion-induced homomorphisms from π_{ij} to π_i (needed for amalgamation).
  - Any notion of free product or amalgamated product.
  - Any universal property or equality/isos asserting π ≅ amalgamated free product.
- Instead, it concludes `True`, which is vacuous and unrelated to the specific mathematical content. The use of `by sorry` indicates no proof, but more importantly, the statement itself is vacuous.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a trivial tautology (`True`) parameterized by some open cover conditions and arbitrary type parameters. It lacks the essential hypotheses (path connected, locally simply connected, path-connected intersections), the precise objects (fundamental groups), the morphisms, the algebraic structures (group structure, amalgamated free product), and the claimed isomorphism/identification. It therefore does not translate the original theorem at all.
- Additional red flags per guidelines:
  - Uses arbitrary `π`, `π_i`, `π_ij` as Types, not fundamental groups.
  - No Mathlib concepts for fundamental groups or free products are used.
  - The conclusion is `True` with `sorry`, i.e., vacuous.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open the `Set` namespace for set-theoretic notation such as `×ˢ` (set product), `interior`, and `closure`.
- The theorem `benmckay_top_topology_556` states: For types `X` and `Y` equipped with topological spaces, and for subsets `A : Set X` and `B : Set Y`, we have the two assertions simultaneously:
  (i) `interior (A ×ˢ B) = interior A ×ˢ interior B`, and
  (ii) `closure (A ×ˢ B) = closure A ×ˢ closure B`.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable under the instructions as long as the statement itself is the intended translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: “Let X be a topological space. Prove that (A × B)^∘ = A^∘ × B^∘ and that \overline{A} × \overline{B} = \overline{A × B}.”
- The Lean code treats two possibly different spaces `X` and `Y`, with `A ⊆ X` and `B ⊆ Y`, whereas the natural language mentions only one space `X`. In the one-space reading, `A, B ⊆ X` and the product is taken in `X × X`. The Lean statement is a standard generalization to two (potentially distinct) spaces `X` and `Y`.
- The second equality in Lean is written as `closure (A ×ˢ B) = closure A ×ˢ closure B` instead of `closure A ×ˢ closure B = closure (A ×ˢ B)`, but equality is symmetric, so this is not a substantive difference.
- Content-wise, both assertions (interior and closure distributing over set product) match the standard facts intended in the natural language. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions; Mathlib’s genuine `interior`, `closure`, and set product `×ˢ` are used.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - The Lean theorem assumes two topological spaces `X` and `Y`, whereas the natural language mentions only `X`. The Lean statement is strictly more general (works for `X × Y` instead of just `X × X`).
  - The equality order in the second claim is reversed but immaterial.
- There are no other mismatches or red flags. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The code is a standard generalization of the natural language statement. Being extra harsh, this is not perfectly “the same” because of the extra space `Y`, so it is “almost the same but not strictly faithful.”

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- We work in a topological space X with a subset A ⊆ X. In Lean, the subspace A is represented by the subtype `Subtype A` with the inclusion map `coe : Subtype A → X` and the induced (subspace) topology.

- Theorem `isClosed_in_subspace_iff`:
  For a subset s of the subspace A (i.e., s : Set (Subtype A)), s is closed in the subspace topology on A if and only if there exists a closed set C in X such that s is exactly the preimage of C under the inclusion `coe`. In symbols: IsClosed s ↔ ∃ C ⊆ X, IsClosed C ∧ s = coe⁻¹(C). Under the standard identification of subsets of `Subtype A` with subsets of X of the form A ∩ C, this says the closed sets in A are precisely those of the form {a ∈ A | a ∈ C}, i.e., A ∩ C with C closed in X.

- Theorem `closure_in_subspace_preimage`:
  For a subset S of the subspace A (S : Set (Subtype A)), the closure of S in the subspace A equals the preimage under the inclusion of the closure in X of the image of S in X. In symbols: closure_A(S) = coe⁻¹(closure_X(coe '' S)). Identifying subsets of `Subtype A` with subsets of X via `coe`, this is exactly closure_A(S) = A ∩ closure_X(S_as_subset_of_X).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First claim (closed sets): The natural statement says closed subsets of A in the subspace topology are exactly A ∩ C where C is closed in X. The Lean theorem restates this as: s ⊆ Subtype A is closed iff there is a closed C in X with s = coe⁻¹(C). Since `coe⁻¹(C)` corresponds to A ∩ C under the standard identification, this is faithful.
- Second claim (closure): The natural statement says the closure in A of S ⊆ A is A ∩ closure_X(S). The Lean theorem expresses this using the canonical coercions: closure_A(S) = coe⁻¹(closure_X(coe '' S)), which is exactly the same content, because `coe '' S` is S viewed as a subset of X, and `coe⁻¹` corresponds to intersecting with A.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean statements are phrased in terms of the subtype `Subtype A` and the inclusion map, while the natural language phrases everything as subsets of X with S ⊆ A. These are canonically equivalent formulations. No extraneous assumptions are introduced, and no essential content is lost.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only theorem statements (with omitted proofs), which is allowed for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language claims, modulo the standard identification between subsets of a subtype and subsets of the ambient type intersected with A.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Context: X and Y are types with topologies. s is a Setoid (an equivalence relation) on X. The quotient space is Quotient s, and the canonical map is Quotient.mk s : X → Quotient s.

- Theorem continuous_comp_of_continuous_on_quotient:
  Statement: For any continuous h : Quotient s → Y, the composition h ∘ Quotient.mk s : X → Y is continuous.
  Natural language: If h is continuous on the quotient space X/∼, then h ∘ q is continuous on X. This matches the first part of the problem exactly.

- Theorem continuous_map_factors_through_iff_const_on_classes:
  Statement: (∃! h : Quotient s → Y, Continuous h ∧ f = h ∘ Quotient.mk s) ↔ ∀ x₁ x₂, s.r x₁ x₂ → f x₁ = f x₂.
  Natural language: There exists a unique continuous h : X/∼ → Y such that f = h ∘ q if and only if f is constant on equivalence classes.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- Original second part: ""Conversely, show that a continuous map f : X → Y arises in this way (i.e., f = h ∘ q for a unique continuous h) if and only if f is constant on equivalence classes."" This requires f to be continuous as part of the equivalence.
- Lean theorem omits the continuity of f on the right-hand side (the equivalence classes condition) and on the statement altogether: it claims that mere constancy on equivalence classes is equivalent to the existence of a unique continuous h with f = h ∘ q. In general topology, this is false unless one also assumes f is continuous, because the universal property of the topological quotient says:
  • Set-theoretic factorization (unique h with f = h ∘ q) ⇔ f respects the equivalence relation.
  • Continuity of h ⇔ continuity of f (with the quotient topology).
  Therefore, the correct topological statement is: (f is continuous ∧ f is constant on equivalence classes) ↔ (∃! h, Continuous h ∧ f = h ∘ q).
- The provided Lean code asserts a stronger, incorrect equivalence by dropping ""f is continuous"" from the right side.

Step 3: Final check.
- Part 1 matches faithfully.
- Part 2 is not faithful: it is missing the continuity assumption on f in the iff, thereby asserting an equivalence that generally fails. No vacuous definitions are present; the mismatch is purely in the logical content of the second theorem.

Conclusion: The translation fails due to the incorrect equivalence in the second theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `variables {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We have topological spaces X and Y.
- `variable (F : ({t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1} × X) → Y)`: A function F from the unit interval (as a subtype of ℝ) times X to Y. No continuity is assumed; it is not asserted to be a homotopy in the topological sense.
- `variable (x0 x1 : X) (x : Path x0 x1)`: Two points x0, x1 in X and a path x from x0 to x1 (this is a genuine Mathlib Path).
- `variable (y0 y1 : Y) (y : Path y0 y1)`: Two points y0, y1 in Y and a path y from y0 to y1. No relation to F or x is imposed.
- `variable (x_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup X x1)`: An arbitrary function x_* between fundamental groups (not defined via conjugation by x, not assumed to be an isomorphism or a homomorphism).
- `variable (y_star : FundamentalGroup Y y0 → FundamentalGroup Y y1)`: An arbitrary function y_* between fundamental groups (again, no definition or properties).
- `variable (f0_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup Y y0)`: An arbitrary function from π1(X,x0) to π1(Y,y0), not specified to be induced by any continuous map f0.
- `variable (f1_star : FundamentalGroup X x1 → FundamentalGroup Y y1)`: An arbitrary function from π1(X,x1) to π1(Y,y1), not specified to be induced by any continuous map f1.
- `lemma ... : (y_star ∘ f0_star) = (f1_star ∘ x_star) := by sorry`: States, without hypotheses, that the composite y_* ∘ f0_* equals f1_* ∘ x_* as functions π1(X,x0) → π1(Y,y1). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement specifies:
  - F is a homotopy F: [0,1] × X → Y (i.e., continuous), and defines f_t(x) = F(t,x).
  - y0 = f0(x0), y1 = f1(x1).
  - x is a path from x0 to x1; y(t) = F(t, x(t)) is a path from y0 to y1.
  - x_* and y_* are specific change-of-basepoint isomorphisms defined by conjugation with x and y: x_*([γ]) = [x̄ * γ * x], y_*([δ]) = [ȳ * δ * y].
  - f0_* and f1_* are the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups by the continuous maps f0 and f1.
  - The conclusion is the naturality equality y_* ∘ (f0)_* = (f1)_* ∘ x_*.

The Lean code, however:
- Does not assert or use continuity of F; F is not even used in the lemma.
- Does not define f0, f1, y0 = f0(x0), y1 = f1(x1); y0, y1 are arbitrary.
- Does not define y(t) = F(t, x(t)); y is arbitrary and unrelated to F and x.
- Does not define x_* and y_* via conjugation by the paths, nor prove they are isomorphisms; they are arbitrary functions.
- Does not define f0_* and f1_* as induced maps from continuous maps; they are arbitrary functions.
- Asserts the equality of two arbitrary composites with no hypotheses and no connection to the given F, x, y.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a vacuous equality of arbitrary functions between fundamental groups, without any link to homotopies, induced homomorphisms, or basepoint-change isomorphisms. The NL statement is a precise naturality statement derived from a homotopy and specific paths, with concrete definitions of x_*, y_*, f0_*, f1_*.
- Key differences:
  - Continuity/homotopy structure is missing in Lean.
  - y0, y1 are not tied to f0 and f1.
  - y is not defined from F and x.
  - x_*, y_* are not defined as the standard conjugation maps; no isomorphism property.
  - f0_*, f1_* are not the induced homomorphisms; just arbitrary functions.
  - The lemma contains `sorry` and no hypotheses ensuring any of the required structure.

Given these, the translation is not faithful. However, if one replaced the arbitrary placeholders with the correct Mathlib definitions (paths-to-change-of-basepoint isos, induced maps from f0,f1, and y defined from F and x), the final target equality matches the NL conclusion. So while currently unfaithful, it could become faithful with substantial fixes.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: X is a topological space.
- `variable {A : Type*} (U : A → Set X) (hcover : ⋃ a, U a = univ)`: We have an indexed family of subsets U a of X whose union is all of X. No openness is assumed.
- The theorem statement introduces `x : ℝ → X` with `hcont : ContinuousOn x (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)`, i.e., x is a function ℝ → X that is continuous on [0,1].
- Conclusion: There exists a natural number n, a function `ts : Fin (n+1) → ℝ` and `as : Fin n → A` such that:
  - `ts 0 = 0` and `ts (Fin.last n) = 1` (the partition endpoints are 0 and 1),
  - for each `i : Fin n`, `ts (i.castSucc) < ts (i.succ)` (strictly increasing partition),
  - for each `i : Fin n`, `image x (Icc (ts (i.castSucc)) (ts (i.succ))) ⊆ U (as i)` (the image of each subinterval is contained in one of the sets U a).
- No auxiliary definitions are made; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which doesn't affect the translation audit.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- NL statement: X is covered by open sets {X_a}, and x : [0,1] → X is a path (so continuous). There exist 0 = t0 < t1 < ... < tn = 1 and indices a_i such that x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) ⊆ X_{a_i} for each i.
- Agreements:
  - X is a topological space covered by a family of sets indexed by A.
  - x is continuous on [0,1] (Lean uses ℝ→X with continuity on [0,1], which is a standard equivalent formulation for the purposes of using subintervals of ℝ).
  - Existence of a finite partition with strictly increasing times from 0 to 1.
  - For each subinterval, the image lies inside one of the covering sets.
- Discrepancy:
  - The Lean code does not assume that each U a is open. The natural language statement explicitly says “covered by open sets.” This is a key hypothesis used in the usual proof (via Lebesgue number lemma or openness of the pullback cover of [0,1]). The code’s statement is strictly stronger than the NL statement and thus not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check
- The two problems are not the same: the Lean statement omits the openness assumption. All other aspects (domain formulation, partition conditions, inclusion statements) match. Because openness is central to the intended result, the translation fails the fidelity test.

Grade rationale
- Almost correct structure and quantification, but missing the crucial “open” assumption makes it not faithful. Hence a high but not perfect score.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- Context: E is an arbitrary real normed vector space (not specifically ℝ^n).
- The theorem asserts the existence of a function f from the closed unit ball {x : E | ‖x‖ ≤ 1} to ℝ × E such that:
  - Injectivity on the interior: For any x, y in the closed unit ball with ‖x‖ < 1 and ‖y‖ < 1, if f x = f y then x = y as elements of E.
  - Boundary collapse: For any x in the closed unit ball with ‖x‖ = 1, we have f x = (-1, 0) ∈ ℝ × E.
- There is no explicit definition of f; it is purely an existence claim.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original statement:
- Fix X = closed unit ball in ℝ^n, A = its boundary sphere, Y = the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}.
- Define a specific function f: X → Y by f(x) = (cos(π‖x‖), sin(π‖x‖) x/‖x‖) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = (1, 0).
- Prove: (i) f is injective on the interior X \ A (i.e., {‖x‖ < 1}), and (ii) f maps every point of A to the single point (-1, 0) ∈ Y.

Differences:
- Specific function vs existence: The NL statement defines an explicit f using cosine, sine, and x/‖x‖ and asks to prove properties of that specific map. The Lean code only asserts there exists some f with these two properties. This is a major mismatch.
- Codomain: The NL codomain is Y, the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}. The Lean codomain is ℝ × E, with no constraint that f lands on the unit sphere. The clause “(−1, 0) ∈ Y” is also not enforced; Y is not even defined.
- Ambient space: The NL fixes E = ℝ^n. The Lean code allows any normed space E, potentially infinite-dimensional. This is a nontrivial generalization and changes the statement.
- Missing value at 0: The NL statement specifies f(0) = (1, 0). The Lean code does not mention this.
- No explicit use of the formula (cos, sin, x/‖x‖). The Lean code omits all the explicit structure.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean theorem is an existence statement in a far more general setting and with a different codomain, omitting the explicit definition of f, the requirement that f map into the unit sphere Y, and the special value at 0. While the two properties (injectivity on the open ball and constant image on the boundary) are present, they are not asserted for the explicitly defined f, and the target set Y is not accounted for. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem factor_through_gram (n : Nat) (f : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f) (hU : ∀ (U : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ), (Matrix.transpose U) * U = 1 → ∀ V, f (U * V) = f V) :` 
  This sets up: fix n, a function f from n×n real matrices to ℝ, assume f is continuous, and assume invariance under left-multiplication by any orthogonal matrix U (encoded as Uᵀ U = I). This corresponds to f(U · V) = f(V) for all V and all U in O(n).
- `∃ g : ({A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // ∃ V : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ, A = Matrix.transpose V * V} → ℝ), Continuous g ∧ ∀ V, f V = g ⟨Matrix.transpose V * V, ⟨V, rfl⟩⟩ := by sorry`
  This asserts the existence of a function g defined on the subtype of matrices A that can be written as A = Vᵀ V (i.e., Gram matrices), with g continuous, and such that for every matrix V, f(V) = g(Gram(V)) where Gram(V) = Vᵀ V. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted but the statement is precise.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL sets f as a continuous function of n vectors v₁, …, vₙ in ℝⁿ invariant under simultaneous orthogonal transformations: f(Uv₁, …, Uvₙ) = f(v₁, …, vₙ) for all U ∈ O(n). Representing the n-tuple (v₁, …, vₙ) as the n×n matrix V whose columns are vᵢ, the invariance becomes f(UV) = f(V). This matches `hU`.
- NL defines Y as the set of all positive semidefinite symmetric n×n matrices (Gram matrices), and claims there exists a continuous g : Y → ℝ such that f(v₁, …, vₙ) = g(A) where A is the Gram matrix with entries ⟨vᵢ, vⱼ⟩. In matrix form, A = Vᵀ V. The Lean code takes Y to be the subtype `{A | ∃ V, A = Vᵀ V}`, which over ℝ is exactly the set of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. It asserts existence of continuous g on this Y and the identity f(V) = g(Vᵀ V) for all V. This matches the NL statement precisely.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain of f: NL uses n-tuples of vectors in ℝⁿ; Lean uses n×n matrices. These are canonically identified (columns-as-vectors), so no substantive difference.
- Group action: NL uses O(n); Lean encodes orthogonality as Uᵀ U = I. Equivalent.
- Target space Y: NL describes Y as symmetric PSD matrices; Lean uses the set of matrices of the form Vᵀ V. Over ℝ these sets coincide, so the formalization is faithful.
- Continuity: Both require f continuous and conclude g is continuous.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof. All terms are standard Mathlib constructs.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- We fix a topological space X with basepoint x0, an index type A, and a family of subsets X_a : A → Set X.
- Assumptions:
  - hopen: each X_a a is open.
  - hbase: x0 ∈ X_a a for all a (so that π1(X_a, x0) makes sense).
  - h_path: X is path connected.
  - h_Xa_path: each X_a is path connected (as a Subtype).
  - h_Xab_path: each pairwise intersection X_a ∩ X_b is path connected.
  - h_loc_simply: X is locally simply connected (each point has a simply connected open neighborhood).
- Definitions of fundamental groups:
  - π := π1(X, x0).
  - π_a a := π1(X_a, x0) where X_a is treated as a Subtype with basepoint ⟨x0, hbase a⟩.
  - π_ab a b := π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0) with basepoint ⟨x0, (hbase a, hbase b)⟩.
- Fix a target group Γ.
- Given group homomorphisms φ_a : π_a a →* Γ for each a.
- Introduce maps claimed to be inclusion-induced, but only as abstract variables:
  - incl_a : π_a a →* π (from each X_a to X)
  - incl_ab_a : π_ab a b →* π_a a (from intersections into the first piece)
  - incl_ab_b : π_ab a b →* π_a b (from intersections into the second piece)
- Compatibility on overlaps: hcompat asserts φ_a a ∘ incl_ab_a a b = φ_a b ∘ incl_ab_b a b as homs π_ab a b →* Γ.
- Theorem statement: There exists a unique φ : π →* Γ such that for all a, φ ∘ incl_a a = φ_a a.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL assumptions: X path connected and locally simply connected; a covering by path connected open sets {X_a} such that every (pairwise) intersection X_ab is path connected. Basepoint x0 is used to define π1(X_a, x0), so implicitly x0 ∈ X_a for all a.
- NL data: a group Γ and homomorphisms π_a → Γ agreeing on each intersection π_ab via the canonical inclusion-induced maps.
- NL conclusion: There exists a unique group morphism π → Γ extending the given morphisms.

Matches:
- Path connectedness of X and of each X_a and each pairwise intersection are assumed in Lean.
- Local simple connectivity is assumed.
- Basepoint x0 is in each X_a.
- π, π_a, and π_ab are defined appropriately.
- The overlap compatibility condition is stated in the expected compositional form.
- The conclusion is the appropriate existence and uniqueness of φ with φ ∘ incl_a = φ_a.

Mismatches and issues:
1) Missing cover condition: The Lean code never assumes that the X_a cover X (i.e., ⋃ a, X_a a = Set.univ). The NL statement explicitly says ""a covering by path connected open sets,"" which entails that they cover X. This is a significant difference.
2) Inclusion maps not enforced to be induced by inclusions: The variables incl_a, incl_ab_a, incl_ab_b are declared as arbitrary group homomorphisms with the right source/target types. The NL statement uses the canonical maps induced by the inclusions of subspaces. In the Lean code, there is no constraint that these are the canonical inclusion-induced maps; they are merely arbitrary parameters. This makes the theorem statement strictly stronger and potentially false in general, and thus not a faithful translation.
3) No compatibility between incl_a and incl_ab_*: For a proper van Kampen-type universal property, one expects the diagram of inclusion-induced maps to satisfy natural compatibilities. The statement only uses hcompat for φ_a on overlaps and does not relate incl_a to incl_ab_a/incl_ab_b, further divorcing the statement from the canonical situation in the NL statement.
4) The code assumes only pairwise intersections are path connected (h_Xab_path). The NL text says “every finite intersection X_ab := X_a ∩ X_b is also path connected,” which, by its notation, appears to mean pairwise intersections. So this point is likely fine.
5) While local simple connectivity is included as a hypothesis, the theorem does not use it structurally (it’s just a parameter). That’s acceptable for translation, but it could be a red flag in terms of intended theorems.

Step 3: Final check.
- The Lean theorem as stated is not faithful: it omits the cover assumption and treats the inclusion maps as arbitrary homomorphisms rather than the canonical inclusion-induced ones. These are substantial deviations from the NL statement. Hence the translation fails.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem claims a homeomorphism:
  Homeomorph (AddCircle (1 : ℝ)) { y : ℝ × ℝ // y ∈ Set.range (fun t : ℝ => (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi * t), Real.sin (2 * Real.pi * t))) }
  In words: the additive circle with period 1 (i.e., ℝ modulo translations by integer multiples of 1, typically denoted ℝ/ℤ) is homeomorphic to the subset of ℝ × ℝ consisting of all points of the form (cos(2πt), sin(2πt)) as t ranges over all real numbers. This subset is exactly the unit circle in ℝ², presented as a subtype via the range of the map t ↦ (cos(2πt), sin(2πt)).
- There are no auxiliary (fake) definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib constructs. The proof is omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original statement: Let X = [0,1] ⊆ ℝ and Y = {(cos(2πt), sin(2πt)) : t ∈ [0,1]} ⊆ ℝ². Define f(t) = (cos(2πt), sin(2πt)). Prove that the quotient space obtained by identifying 0 and 1 in X, namely X/{0,1}, is homeomorphic to Y.
- Code’s domain: AddCircle (1 : ℝ), i.e., ℝ/ℤ. This is not the quotient of the interval [0,1] with endpoints identified; it is the quotient of the entire real line by integer translations. While ℝ/ℤ is indeed homeomorphic to [0,1] with endpoints glued, the code statement does not mention [0,1]/∼ or establish that homeomorphism.
- Code’s codomain: the range of t ↦ (cos(2πt), sin(2πt)) with t over ℝ. The natural language Y uses t ∈ [0,1]. These two sets coincide (both describe the unit circle), so this part is acceptable.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code proves (states) a homeomorphism between ℝ/ℤ and the unit circle, whereas the natural language problem asks for a homeomorphism between the specific quotient [0,1]/(0 ∼ 1) and the unit circle. Although the two domain spaces are homeomorphic, the code does not assert or use that identification; it replaces the intended domain with a different but equivalent model. Under the auditing guidelines (extra harsh), this is not a faithful translation.
- Minor difference in Y’s definition (range over ℝ vs over [0,1]) is harmless since the sets are equal.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the domain mismatch ([0,1]/(0 ∼ 1) vs AddCircle ℝ). Everything else is fine, and the statement is very close, but not the same.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- We fix a topological space X.
- We consider functions x, y : ℝ → X that are continuous on the closed interval Icc 0 1 = [0,1]. These are intended to represent paths [0,1] → X.
- We assume a function τ : ℝ → ℝ that is continuous on [0,1], strictly increasing on [0,1] (StrictMonoOn τ (Icc 0 1)), and satisfies τ(0) = 0, τ(1) = 1.
- We assume y ∘ τ = x on [0,1], expressed as ∀ s ∈ Icc 0 1, y (τ s) = x s.
- Conclusion: There exists H : ℝ × ℝ → X that is continuous on [0,1] × [0,1] and satisfies the boundary conditions:
  - For all s ∈ [0,1], H (s, 0) = x s (the bottom edge is x),
  - For all s ∈ [0,1], H (s, 1) = y s (the top edge is y),
  - For all t ∈ [0,1], H (0, t) = x 0, H (1, t) = x 1 (the left and right edges are fixed at the endpoints of x). Since from y ∘ τ = x and τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1 we have x 0 = y 0 and x 1 = y 1, this is exactly the endpoints being fixed.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: x, y are paths [0,1] → X; τ : [0,1] → [0,1] continuous, strictly increasing, τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1, and y ∘ τ = x. Prove x and y are homotopic relative {0,1}.
- Lean encoding: Uses x, y, τ defined on ℝ but only requires the relevant properties on [0,1]. This is a standard encoding and is faithful.
- Strictly increasing and endpoint equalities are properly captured via StrictMonoOn and τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1. The codomain [0,1] condition is not explicitly stated, but it follows from strict monotonicity and endpoint values that τ([0,1]) ⊆ [0,1], so this is implicitly satisfied; additionally, y is defined on ℝ so y ∘ τ is meaningful regardless.
- The conclusion provides a continuous H on [0,1]×[0,1] with H(s,0)=x(s), H(s,1)=y(s), H(0,t)=x(0), H(1,t)=x(1), i.e., a homotopy between x and y that fixes the endpoints for all t. Since x 0 = y 0 and x 1 = y 1 follow from the hypotheses, this matches “homotopic relative {0,1}”.

Step 3: Final comparison
- No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions are present.
- The encoding of paths and homotopy is standard and accurate.
- Boundary conditions are exactly those required for a homotopy rel {0,1}.
- The reparametrization condition is correctly expressed.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The comment states the intended mathematical content: classification of finite-dimensional field extensions of ℝ as ℝ or ℂ, and two consequences about splitting fields and factorization over ℂ.
- `theorem finite_dimensional_field_over_R_is_R_or_C (k : Type*) [Field k] [Algebra Real k] [FiniteDimensional Real k] (h_inj : Function.Injective (algebraMap Real k)) : Nonempty (k ≃ₐ[Real] Real) ∨ Nonempty (k ≃ₐ[Real] Complex) := by sorry`
  Translation: Let k be a field with an ℝ-algebra structure, finite-dimensional as an ℝ-vector space, and such that the algebra map ℝ → k is injective (i.e., ℝ embeds in k). Then k is ℝ-algebra isomorphic either to ℝ or to ℂ. This matches “k = ℝ or k = ℂ up to isomorphism,” with the injectivity condition faithfully encoding “containing ℝ.”
- `theorem finite_algebraic_extension_degree_le_two (K : Type*) [Field K] [Algebra Real K] [FiniteDimensional Real K] : Module.rank Real K ≤ 2 := by sorry`
  Translation: If K is a field that is finite-dimensional over ℝ, then the ℝ-linear dimension (as a cardinal, Module.rank) is ≤ 2. For finite-dimensional vector spaces this corresponds to the usual dimension being ≤ 2. This captures the content that any finite algebraic extension of ℝ has degree at most 2; it is more general than specifically mentioning splitting fields, but implies that splitting fields of real polynomials have degree ≤ 2 over ℝ.
- `theorem complex_is_alg_closed : IsAlgClosed Complex := by sorry`
  Translation: ℂ is algebraically closed, i.e., every complex polynomial splits as a product of linear factors over ℂ. This directly matches the final clause of the natural language statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- First main claim (classification): The Lean theorem states exactly the classification “k ≃ₐ[ℝ] ℝ or k ≃ₐ[ℝ] ℂ” under the right hypotheses. The extra hypothesis of injectivity of `algebraMap ℝ k` is appropriate to model “k contains ℝ.” This is faithful.
- “In particular” about splitting fields having degree ≤ 2 over ℝ: The code does not state this explicitly for splitting fields, but proves a stronger general fact that any finite-dimensional field extension over ℝ has (vector space) dimension ≤ 2. Since splitting fields over ℝ are finite algebraic extensions of ℝ, this implies the stated “in particular.” This is acceptable as a faithful translation of the content, though it is phrased more generally and does not explicitly mention “splitting field.”
- “Every complex polynomial splits into linear factors over ℂ”: The Lean theorem `IsAlgClosed Complex` is exactly this.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Match: The first theorem is a faithful formalization of “k = ℝ or k = ℂ up to isomorphism.”
- Minor difference: The “in particular” about splitting fields is not stated verbatim; instead, a strictly stronger corollary is stated (“any finite-dimensional ℝ-field extension has degree ≤ 2”). This still entails the intended consequence about splitting fields, so the mathematical meaning is preserved.
- Match: The statement that every complex polynomial splits over ℂ is captured precisely by `IsAlgClosed Complex`.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all statements use standard Mathlib notions. Proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is allowed per the instructions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement, with the only mild deviation being that the splitting-field corollary is stated in a more general form rather than mentioning splitting fields explicitly.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- Variables: We have a topological space X with an equivalence relation s : Setoid X, and a (possibly arbitrary) topology on the quotient type Quotient s, plus a topological space Y.
- def q : X → Quotient s := Quotient.mk s. This is the canonical projection map sending x to its equivalence class [x].
- Theorem continuous_iff_comp_quotient: Under the hypothesis ht that the topology on Quotient s is the coinduced (final/quotient) topology via q (i.e., the usual quotient topology), for any function h : Quotient s → Y, we have Continuous h ↔ Continuous (h ∘ q s). This is precisely the universal property of the quotient topology.
- Theorem continuous_descend_iff: Under the same quotient-topology hypothesis ht, suppose F : X → Y is continuous (hF). Then the following are equivalent: (∃ G : Quotient s → Y, Continuous G ∧ G ∘ q s = F) ↔ ∀ x1 x2, Setoid.r s x1 x2 → F x1 = F x2. That is, a continuous map F from X to Y descends to a continuous map on the quotient if and only if F is constant on equivalence classes.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First part: “Let q : X → X/~ be the quotient map for an equivalence relation ~ on X. A map h : X/~ → Y is continuous iff h ∘ q : X → Y is continuous.” The Lean theorem continuous_iff_comp_quotient states exactly this, with the explicit assumption ht ensuring the topology on the quotient is the quotient (coinduced) topology. This matches the statement faithfully.
- Second part: “Conversely, a continuous map F : X → Y descends to a continuous map X/~ → Y iff F(x1) = F(x2) whenever x1 ~ x2.” The Lean theorem continuous_descend_iff assumes F is continuous (hF) and proves the equivalence between existence of a continuous G on the quotient with G ∘ q = F and the condition that F is constant on equivalence classes. This matches the natural language precisely.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No vacuous placeholders: q is the actual quotient projection; theorems use real Mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace.coinduced, Continuous, Setoid.r). No fake definitions.
- The added hypothesis ht aligns exactly with “q is the quotient map/topology,” ensuring faithfulness.
- The requirement that F is continuous before descending matches the natural-language assumption “a continuous map F … descends … iff …”.
- No extra or missing conditions relevant to the statements.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]
  Interprets X as a type equipped with a topology.

- def one_point_open (U : Set (WithTop X)) : Prop :=
  (U ⊆ Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X) ∧ IsOpen (WithTop.some ⁻¹' U)) ∨
  ((Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X))ᶜ ⊆ U ∧ ∃ C : Set X, IsCompact C ∧
   U = (Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X))ᶜ ∪ (Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X) \ (WithTop.some '' C)))

  Natural language: A subset U of WithTop X (i.e., X with an extra point ∞) is declared open if either:
  (1) U is contained entirely in the copy of X inside WithTop X (that copy is the range of the inclusion x ↦ some x), and the preimage of U under the inclusion X → WithTop X is open in X; or
  (2) U contains the extra point ∞ (the complement of the range is {∞}) and there exists a compact set C ⊆ X such that U = {∞} ∪ (copy of X \ image of C). This is precisely U = {∞} ∪ (X \ C) expressed inside WithTop X. The first conjunct ((range)ᶜ ⊆ U) is redundant given the equality, but consistent with the intention that U contains ∞.

- def one_point_topology : TopologicalSpace (WithTop X) := by sorry
  Intended: Define the topology on WithTop X whose open sets are exactly those specified by one_point_open. However, this is left as a placeholder (sorry), i.e., no actual TopologicalSpace is provided or verified to satisfy the axioms.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
- The original statement: Define the open sets on X ∪ {∞} such that U is open if either U is open in X (i.e., does not contain ∞), or U = {∞} ∪ (X \ C) for some compact C ⊆ X; then prove this defines a topology (the one-point compactification).
- The predicate one_point_open faithfully encodes the two cases:
  • Case 1: U avoids ∞ and is open in X (captured via inclusion into WithTop and open preimage).
  • Case 2: U contains ∞ and equals {∞} ∪ (X \ C) for some compact C.
  So the declaration of which subsets are open is accurate.
- However, the second part of the statement — that these opens define a topology — is not carried out. The code attempts to define a TopologicalSpace via one_point_topology but leaves it as sorry. By the auditing rules, any auxiliary definition filled with sorry is vacuous and fails the translation requirement.
- Additionally, Mathlib’s standard type for the one-point compactification is OnePoint X, not WithTop X. Using WithTop X is nonstandard and may be misleading, though the encoding of the extra point and inclusion is conceptually correct if treated as a separate construction. This is a stylistic/terminological concern rather than a correctness one, but it is a red flag regarding the use of standard Mathlib terms.

Step 3: Final comparison
- Do they state the same mathematical content? The predicate one_point_open matches the intended definition of opens. But the crucial claim “this defines a topology” is not provided: the TopologicalSpace structure is missing (replaced by sorry). Therefore, the overall translation does not faithfully realize the full statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous definition with sorry. If the sorry were replaced by a proper construction of TopologicalSpace (e.g., by setting IsOpen := one_point_open and verifying the axioms), the translation would be faithful.
