1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α]`: We work in an arbitrary topological space α.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_2_19a {A B : Set α} (hA : IsClosed A) (hB : IsClosed B) (hdisj : A ∩ B = ∅) : closure A ∩ B = (∅ : Set α) ∧ A ∩ closure B = (∅ : Set α)` states: If A and B are closed subsets of a topological space α and they are disjoint (their intersection is empty), then the closures of A and B satisfy closure A ∩ B = ∅ and A ∩ closure B = ∅; i.e., A and B are separated.

2) Whole translation vs natural language:
- The natural language statement: In a metric space X, if A and B are disjoint closed sets, then they are separated.
- The Lean statement asserts exactly the definition of “separated” (closure A ∩ B = ∅ and A ∩ closure B = ∅) under the hypothesis that A and B are closed and disjoint. This matches the intended conclusion.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: Lean works in a general topological space rather than a metric space. This is a slight generalization but consistent with topology (the result is true in any topological space). This generalization is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct and faithful to the meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language result, with a benign generalization from metric spaces to topological spaces.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_4 {α : Type*} [Preorder α] {E : Set α} {a b : α}`: We work in a type α equipped with a Preorder (i.e., an ordered set in the broad sense). E is a subset of α, and a, b are elements of α.
- Hypotheses:
  - `hne : ∃ x, x ∈ E`: E is nonempty.
  - `h_lower : ∀ x, x ∈ E → a ≤ x`: a is a lower bound of E.
  - `h_upper : ∀ x, x ∈ E → x ≤ b`: b is an upper bound of E.
- Conclusion: `a ≤ b`.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; irrelevant for checking the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: Let E be a nonempty subset of an ordered set; suppose α is a lower bound of E and β is an upper bound of E. Prove that α ≤ β.
The Lean statement exactly encodes this: E nonempty (hne), a lower bound (h_lower), b upper bound (h_upper), conclude a ≤ b. The structure `[Preorder α]` is a mild generalization of “ordered set” and is sufficient; this is acceptable per the guidelines.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is that the code assumes a Preorder rather than a stricter order (partial or total), which is a harmless and standard generalization. No vacuous auxiliary definitions or placeholders for concepts; no extra or missing hypotheses. Thus, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, providing standard definitions like `Irrational` and coercions from `ℚ` to `ℝ`.
- The theorem declaration:
  - `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_1b (r : ℚ) (hr : r ≠ 0) (x : ℝ) (hx : Irrational x) : Irrational ((r : ℝ) * x) := by sorry`
  - This states: For a rational number `r` with `r ≠ 0`, and a real number `x` with `x` irrational, the product `(r : ℝ) * x` is irrational. The coercion `(r : ℝ)` is the standard embedding of rationals into reals.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: If r is rational (r ≠ 0) and x is irrational, then r x is irrational.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: it specifies `r : ℚ`, `hr : r ≠ 0`, `x : ℝ`, `hx : Irrational x`, and concludes `Irrational ((r : ℝ) * x)`. This is precisely the same mathematical claim.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for our task since we're judging translation, not proof.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same. No extra assumptions or weakenings; the domain (reals) is the standard setting for irrational numbers. The coercion of `r` to `ℝ` is exactly what is intended.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and the subsequent `open` lines just bring in libraries and namespaces; they do not affect the mathematical content of the statement.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem Rudin_exercise_2_25 (K : Type u_2) [MetricSpace K] [CompactSpace K] : SecondCountableTopology K := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type K equipped with a metric space structure and whose induced topology makes K compact, K has a second-countable topology. In Mathlib, `SecondCountableTopology K` means there exists a countable basis (countable base) for the topology on K.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: ""Prove that every compact metric space K has a countable base."" The Lean statement exactly asserts that any K with `[MetricSpace K]` and `[CompactSpace K]` has `SecondCountableTopology K`, which is precisely “has a countable base.”

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same. No extra assumptions or restrictions are introduced. No auxiliary definitions are made. The empty space case is included and is fine. The use of `SecondCountableTopology` is the standard formalization of “has a countable base.”

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the full Mathlib library, providing definitions and theorems for complex numbers, sums, etc.
- `open Complex`: Opens the `Complex` namespace so names there can be used without qualification (though the code still uses `Complex.abs` explicitly).
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_12 {n : Nat} (z : Fin n → ℂ) : Complex.abs (∑ i : Fin n, z i) ≤ ∑ i : Fin n, Complex.abs (z i) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n and any function z from the finite index type `Fin n` to the complex numbers ℂ (so z(i) are n complex numbers), the absolute value (modulus) of the sum of these n complex numbers is less than or equal to the sum of their absolute values; i.e., |∑_{i in Fin n} z i| ≤ ∑_{i in Fin n} |z i|.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original says: If z₁, ..., z_n are complex, then |z₁ + ... + z_n| ≤ |z₁| + ... + |z_n|. The Lean statement uses an index `i : Fin n` to represent z₀, ..., z_{n-1}, but this is equivalent to having n complex numbers. The sums correspond exactly to the finite triangle inequality.
- The modulus `Complex.abs` is exactly the absolute value on ℂ.
- The use of `n : Nat` includes the case n = 0, where both sides are 0; this is a harmless slight generalization, allowed by the guidelines.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just a direct theorem statement.

3) Final check:
- The math problems are the same: finite triangle inequality for complex numbers. Indexing shift (0-based vs 1-based) is standard and does not change the meaning. Allowing n = 0 is a slight generalization, acceptable and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which contains the definitions of Complex and the typeclass `LinearOrderedField`.
- Comment: States the intended exercise: show there is no order on the complex field making it an ordered field; formalized as ""there is no `LinearOrderedField` instance on `Complex`"".
- `theorem no_linear_order_on_Complex : ¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex) := by sorry`: This asserts that there does not exist a `LinearOrderedField` structure on `Complex`. In other words, there is no way to equip `ℂ` with a linear order compatible with field operations as required by the `LinearOrderedField` axioms.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field."" In Mathlib, an ""ordered field"" (in the standard mathematical sense used in analysis and algebra) is captured by the typeclass `LinearOrderedField`, i.e., a field with a total (linear) order compatible with addition and multiplication by nonnegatives. Therefore, stating `¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex)` is exactly the claim that no such order exists on `ℂ`.

3) Final check:
- Original: no order on ℂ making it an ordered field (total order) exists.
- Lean: there is no `LinearOrderedField` structure on `Complex`.
These are the same mathematical statement. There are no auxiliary, vacuous, or misleading definitions. The use of `Nonempty` is the standard formal way to express existence of a structure instance. Everything aligns.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in mathlib; no mathematical content change.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_17 {k : Nat} (x y : Fin k → ℝ) : ...` states: for any natural number k and vectors x, y in ℝ^k (represented as functions `Fin k → ℝ`), we have
  `(∑ i, (x i + y i)^2) + (∑ i, (x i - y i)^2) = 2 * (∑ i, (x i)^2) + 2 * (∑ i, (y i)^2)`.
  Here `Finset.univ.sum` sums over all coordinates i = 0, ..., k-1. This is exactly the coordinatewise version of the parallelogram identity expressed in terms of sums of squares of coordinates.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is |x + y|^2 + |x - y|^2 = 2|x|^2 + 2|y|^2 for x, y ∈ ℝ^k, where |·| denotes the usual Euclidean length. In ℝ^k with the Euclidean norm, |x|^2 = ∑ i x_i^2, and similarly for |x ± y|^2. The Lean statement replaces |·|^2 with the corresponding sum of squares, which is an exact expansion of the same quantity for ℝ^k under the Euclidean norm.
- The representation of ℝ^k as `Fin k → ℝ` is standard in Lean. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The only difference is syntactic: the Lean code uses explicit sums of squares of coordinates instead of the norm notation |·|^2. Mathematically, these are the same in Rudin's setting (Euclidean norm on ℝ^k). There is no change of meaning or unintended generalization/specialization.
- No red flags: no placeholder/vacuous definitions, no unrelated generalizations, and the statement matches the intended identity exactly.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Let f be defined for all real x, and suppose that |f(x)-f(y)| ≤ (x-y)^2 for all real x and y. Prove that f is constant.""

  Given a real sequence a indexed by natural numbers with a_n ≥ 0 for all n and with the series Σ a_n (over n ∈ ℕ) summable, then the series Σ sqrt(a_n)/(n+1) (over n ∈ ℕ) is summable. The denominator uses (n+1) to avoid division by zero at n = 0.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If Σ a_n converges and a_n ≥ 0, then Σ sqrt(a_n)/n converges. Typically, the latter sum is taken from n = 1 to ∞ (to avoid division by zero). The Lean version expresses exactly this by indexing from n = 0 with denominator (n+1). This is a standard, faithful formalization of the same series.
- The assumption a_n ≥ 0 is included.
- The assumption that Σ a_n converges is stated via `Summable a` (over ℕ), which is equivalent to convergence from n = 1 since adding/removing finitely many terms does not affect convergence.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem is stated.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The only technical difference is the indexing and the denominator (n vs n+1), which is the standard way in Lean to model a sum starting at n = 1. This does not change the mathematical content. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Let f: ℝ → ℝ be a function. Assume f is continuous (hf : Continuous f) and is an open map (hopen : IsOpenMap f). Then f is monotone increasing or monotone decreasing (Monotone f ∨ Antitone f). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that every continuous open mapping of R^1 into R^1 is monotonic.""
- Lean: For any f: ℝ → ℝ that is continuous and an open map, f is monotone (either order-preserving or order-reversing). This exactly captures “monotonic” in the common sense (either nondecreasing or nonincreasing). Domain and codomain are ℝ, matching ℝ^1.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra or missing hypotheses: continuity and open map are both assumed.
- Conclusion ""monotonic"" is represented as ""Monotone f ∨ Antitone f"", which aligns with the standard interpretation of ""monotonic"" in analysis.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement using standard Mathlib notions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural statement:
- The natural statement assumes |z| = 1, equivalently z\bar z = 1. The Lean hypothesis `h : z * star z = 1` matches this exactly.
- The expression |w|^2 is represented as w * conj w in ℂ. Thus |1+z|^2 + |1−z|^2 corresponds to (1+z) * conj(1+z) + (1−z) * conj(1−z). Equating this sum to 4 (interpreted as 4 + 0i in ℂ) is a faithful formalization of the real-valued computation.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only technical nuance is that the Lean statement lives in ℂ using w * conj w rather than the real norm squared, but this is exactly the standard identity and is even indicated in the problem statement (\""that is, such that z \bar z = 1\""). Hence there is no substantive difference.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem cleanly encodes the intended statement with the proof omitted (which is acceptable per instructions).

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_3 {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] {f : X → Real} (hf : Continuous f) : IsClosed ({ x : X | f x = 0 }) := by sorry`
  This sets up: X is a type with a metric space structure, f is a function from X to the real numbers, and hf asserts f is continuous. The conclusion `IsClosed ({ x : X | f x = 0 })` states that the zero set of f is closed. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Faithfulness check:
- Natural language: ""Let f be a continuous real function on a metric space X. Let Z(f) be the set of all p in X at which f(p)=0. Prove that Z(f) is closed.""
- Lean: Assumes f : X → Real is continuous on a metric space X and concludes `IsClosed {x | f x = 0}`. This exactly matches the definition of Z(f) and the claim that Z(f) is closed.

Final comparison:
- Domain and codomain: Metric space X, real-valued f — matches.
- Continuity: Assumed via `hf : Continuous f` — matches.
- Zero set: Represented as `{ x : X | f x = 0 }` — matches Z(f).
- Claim: `IsClosed` — matches ""Z(f) is closed"".
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no generalization or specialization beyond the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_18b (x : Fin 1 → ℝ) (hx : ∃ i, x i ≠ 0) : ...` introduces a vector `x` in ℝ^1 represented as a function `Fin 1 → ℝ`, and assumes `hx`, which means there exists a coordinate `i` with `x i ≠ 0`. In ℝ^1 this is exactly the statement that `x ≠ 0`.
- The conclusion `¬ ∃ y : Fin 1 → ℝ, (∃ j, y j ≠ 0) ∧ (∑ i : Fin 1, x i * y i) = 0` says there does not exist a vector `y` in ℝ^1 such that `y` is nonzero (encoded as existence of a coordinate `j` with `y j ≠ 0`) and the sum `∑ i : Fin 1, x i * y i = 0`. For `Fin 1`, this sum is the standard dot product `x · y` (just `x 0 * y 0`).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib constructs and expresses the inner product as a finite sum over `Fin 1`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The Lean statement corresponds to: If `k=1` and `x ∈ ℝ^k` is nonzero, then there does not exist a nonzero `y ∈ ℝ^k` with `x · y = 0`.
- The given natural language statement omits the hypothesis that `x ≠ 0`: “If k = 1 and x ∈ ℝ^k, prove that there does not exist y ∈ ℝ^k such that y ≠ 0 but x · y = 0.” Without the hypothesis `x ≠ 0`, the statement is false (taking `x = 0`, any nonzero `y` satisfies `x · y = 0`).

3) Final comparison:
- Difference: The Lean code adds the necessary assumption that `x` is nonzero (encoded as `∃ i, x i ≠ 0`). The natural language statement as written does not include this, making it strictly stronger (and in fact false when `x = 0`).
- Everything else (use of ℝ, `k=1`, dot product as sum over coordinates, nonzeroness of `y`) matches.

Conclusion: The code is a correct formalization of the standard and presumably intended statement (with `x ≠ 0`), but it is not a faithful translation of the natural language as given because it introduces an additional hypothesis. Hence, not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- import Mathlib; open Set Metric: Brings in standard library and notations for sets and metric spaces.
- def is_condensation_point {k : ℕ} (E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)) (x : Fin k → ℝ) : Prop := ∀ ε > 0, ¬ Set.Countable (E ∩ Metric.ball x ε)
  Translation: For E ⊆ ℝ^k (modeled as Fin k → ℝ) and a point x in ℝ^k, x is a condensation point of E if for every radius ε > 0, the intersection of E with the open ball centered at x of radius ε is uncountable (expressed as “not countable” in Mathlib). Using open balls is equivalent to “every neighborhood” in a metric space.
- def condensation_points {k : ℕ} (E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)) : Set (Fin k → ℝ) := { x | is_condensation_point E x }
  Translation: The set P of condensation points of E is all points x in ℝ^k satisfying the above property.
- theorem Rudin_exercise_2_27b {k : ℕ} (E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)) (hE : ¬ Set.Countable E) : Set.Countable (E \ condensation_points E) := by sorry
  Translation: If E ⊆ ℝ^k is uncountable (¬ countable), then the set of points of E that are not condensation points of E, i.e., E \ P, is countable.

Step 2: Assess overall faithfulness
- The natural language statement: For uncountable E ⊆ ℝ^k and P the set of condensation points of E, prove E \ P is at most countable.
- The Lean code defines condensation points in the standard way (every neighborhood has uncountably many points of E), correctly encoded via open balls and “not countable,” which matches uncountability. It defines P = condensation_points E and states the theorem exactly as “Set.Countable (E \ P).”
- The ambient space ℝ^k is represented as Fin k → ℝ, with a standard metric; using open balls is equivalent to neighborhoods in this metric setting. Allowing k = 0 is a harmless generality and does not affect faithfulness.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no misuse of terms.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The definition of condensation point matches the usual notion; counting x itself is irrelevant for uncountability.
- The theorem statement matches the requested conclusion exactly.
- No extra assumptions are introduced; no weakening/strengthening that changes meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {𝕜 : Type*} [NormedField 𝕜]`: We work over an arbitrary normed field 𝕜.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_3_13 {a b : ℕ → 𝕜} (ha : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)) (hb : Summable (fun n => ‖b n‖)) : Summable (fun k => ‖(Finset.range (k+1)).sum fun i => a i * b (k - i)‖)` states: given two sequences a, b in 𝕜 whose series converge absolutely (Summable of norms), the sequence whose k-th term is the norm of the finite sum ∑_{i=0}^k a i * b (k - i) is summable. Here `(Finset.range (k+1)).sum (fun i => a i * b (k - i))` is exactly the k-th Cauchy product coefficient c_k = ∑_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}. Thus the conclusion says that ∑_k ‖c_k‖ converges, i.e., the Cauchy product series converges absolutely.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- The natural language claim: ""the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely."" The Lean statement: if ∑ ‖a_n‖ and ∑ ‖b_n‖ converge, then ∑ ‖∑_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}‖ converges. This is precisely the absolute convergence of the Cauchy product series.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Lean works over a general normed field 𝕜, which is a mild generalization of the usual ℝ/ℂ setting and is standard.
- Definition of Cauchy product is faithful via the finite convolution sum for each k.
- Conclusion asserts absolute convergence (Summable of norms). No extra or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is the only item.

Therefore the Lean code faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

  This asserts that the sequence f(n) = sqrt((n:ℝ)^2 + n) − (n:ℝ), where n ranges over natural numbers, tends to 1/2 as n goes to infinity (the atTop filter on ℕ). The `sorry` is a placeholder for the proof and does not affect the statement’s meaning.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: lim_{n→∞} sqrt(n^2 + n) − n = 1/2. The Lean statement uses n ∈ ℕ with the atTop filter, which is the standard formalization of n → ∞ for sequences indexed by natural numbers. The expression inside exactly matches sqrt(n^2 + n) − n (with appropriate coercions to ℝ). The limit value is 1/2. Thus, the formal statement directly matches the intended claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of n: The code uses n ∈ ℕ going to atTop, which aligns with the conventional interpretation of limits of sequences indexed by n→∞. The natural language uses n→∞ without explicit domain, and in standard contexts it means n ∈ ℕ. No substantive difference.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is direct and faithful.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

- The theorem statement:
  `∃ (E : Set ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ), ContinuousOn f E ∧ ∀ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g → ∃ x ∈ E, g x ≠ f x`.
  This reads: There exists a subset E of the real numbers and a function f from ℝ to ℝ such that f is continuous on E (i.e., continuous with respect to the subspace topology on E), and for every continuous function g: ℝ → ℝ, there exists a point x in E with g x ≠ f x.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language asks for a set E ⊆ ℝ and a real continuous function f defined on E with the property that there does not exist a continuous real function g on ℝ such that g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.
- In Lean, using `f : ℝ → ℝ` with `ContinuousOn f E` expresses exactly “f is continuous on E” (continuity in the subspace topology). This is a standard formalization of a function defined on E.
- The clause `∀ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g → ∃ x ∈ E, g x ≠ f x` is logically equivalent to “there does not exist a continuous g on ℝ with g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.” Thus, the non-extension property is captured correctly.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given.
- The only slight formalization difference is allowing f to be globally defined but only requiring continuity on E, which is standard and faithful to the intent. The quantifiers and predicates exactly match the original statement.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language problem.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let f be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set E in R^1. Prove that f is bounded on E.""
- The Lean hypotheses match precisely: f: ℝ → ℝ, uniformly continuous on E (UniformContinuousOn f E), and E is bounded (encoded via ∃ M ≥ 0 with |x| ≤ M for all x ∈ E, which is equivalent to boundedness in ℝ). The conclusion that f is bounded on E is exactly ∃ N with |f x| ≤ N for all x ∈ E (adding 0 ≤ N is harmless and standard).
- The use of UniformContinuousOn (rather than UniformContinuous on all ℝ) matches the phrasing ""on the bounded set E"".

3) Final comparison and differences:
- No substantive differences. The added nonnegativity constraints 0 ≤ M and 0 ≤ N are benign normalizations.
- The encoding of boundedness of E via absolute value about 0 is equivalent to the standard notion of boundedness in ℝ.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

  In words: For any open set U in ℝ, there exists a sequence f: ℕ → Set ℝ such that each f n is open, the family is pairwise disjoint (for i ≠ j, f i ∩ f j = ∅), and the union over all n equals U.
  The proof is omitted via `by sorry`, which is acceptable for our auditing of the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Every open set in ℝ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments."" In standard analysis context, this is the classical result that an open subset of ℝ is a countable disjoint union of open intervals (the connected components), i.e., the pieces are intervals.
- The Lean theorem asserts a countable family of pairwise disjoint open sets covering U, but does not require these open sets to be intervals (segments). It is therefore strictly weaker. For example, taking f 0 = U and f n = ∅ for n > 0 satisfies the Lean statement even when U is not an interval. This would not satisfy the natural statement, which requires the pieces to be intervals.

3) Final comparison:
- Same parts: countability (via ℕ-indexing), disjointness, union equals U, U open in ℝ.
- Difference: The natural statement specifies the pieces are segments/intervals (typically open intervals), whereas the Lean code allows arbitrary open sets. This is a substantial weakening of the claim.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the only issue is the mismatch in the nature of the covering pieces.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement because it omits the crucial requirement that the pieces are intervals (segments).

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_7 {f g : 𝕜 → 𝕜} {f' g' x : 𝕜}`: We consider functions f, g: 𝕜 → 𝕜 and a point x ∈ 𝕜, with derivatives at x denoted by scalars f', g'.
- `(hf : HasDerivAt f f' x) (hg : HasDerivAt g g' x)`: f and g are differentiable at x with derivatives f', g' respectively.
- `(hg_ne : g' ≠ 0)`: The derivative of g at x is nonzero.
- `(f_x : f x = 0) (g_x : g x = 0)`: f and g both vanish at x.
- Conclusion: `Filter.Tendsto (fun t => f t / g t) (nhdsWithin x {t | t ≠ x}) (nhds (f' / g'))`: The function t ↦ f(t)/g(t) tends to f'/g' as t → x, where the approach avoids t = x (since the quotient is undefined at x when g(x) = 0). This expresses lim_{t → x, t ≠ x} f(t)/g(t) = f'/g'.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: Suppose f'(x), g'(x) exist, g'(x) ≠ 0, and f(x) = g(x) = 0. Prove that lim_{t→x} f(t)/g(t) = f'(x)/g'(x).

- Nonzero derivative of g: `g' ≠ 0`.
- Vanishing at x: `f x = 0`, `g x = 0`.
- Conclusion: limit of the quotient equals the ratio of derivatives. The Lean statement uses `nhdsWithin x {t | t ≠ x}`, which is the standard way to formalize a limit when the function is not defined at the point (excluding x from the domain). This matches the intended meaning of the usual limit notation.
- The code generalizes from ℝ to any nontrivially normed field 𝕜, which is a common, legitimate slight generalization and is acceptable per guidelines.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Hypotheses and conclusion match exactly in mathematical meaning. The use of `nhdsWithin` to exclude the point is appropriate and faithful.

There are no auxiliary definitions; it's a direct statement about limsups of real sequences.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For real sequences {a_n}, {b_n}, prove limsup(a_n + b_n) ≤ limsup a_n + limsup b_n, provided the right-hand side is not of the form ∞ − ∞. This indicates the limsup is considered in the extended reals, allowing the possibility of ±∞, hence the proviso to avoid undefined sums.
- The Lean statement works in ℝ (not extended reals). It asserts the inequality unconditionally, without any proviso. Thus it omits the important side condition regarding the undefined form ∞ − ∞ and does not model the extended-real limsup.
- As a specialization: If one restricts to the case where both limsups are finite real numbers, the Lean statement matches the intended inequality. However, the original statement explicitly accommodates the extended-real values and includes a condition to handle the ∞ − ∞ ambiguity. The Lean code does not capture this nuance.

3) Final comparison:
- Same core inequality structure (limsup of sum ≤ sum of limsups).
- Differences:
  - The natural language statement uses extended real limsups; Lean uses ℝ-valued limsup.
  - The natural language statement includes the condition excluding ∞ − ∞; the Lean statement has no such condition (and cannot express it in ℝ).
Given these, the Lean code is a close specialization but not a faithful translation of the full statement as written.

- Import Mathlib: brings in the standard topology library.
- Theorem statement:
  - `{X : Type _} (t : TopologicalSpace X)`: We fix a type X with a topology t.
  - `{Y A : Set X}`: Y and A are subsets of X.
  - `(h : A ⊆ Y)`: A is a subset of Y.
  - Goal:
    `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : A => ⟨(a : X), h a.2⟩ : A → Y)
      (TopologicalSpace.induced (fun y : Y => (y : X)) t) =
     TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : A => (a : X)) t`

  Translation of the goal:
  - `(fun y : Y => (y : X)) : Y → X` is the inclusion of Y into X.
  - `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun y : Y => (y : X)) t` is the subspace topology on Y inherited from X.
  - `(fun a : A => ⟨(a : X), h a.2⟩) : A → Y` is the inclusion of A into Y, using h to show an element of A is in Y.
  - `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : A => ⟨(a : X), h a.2⟩) (TopologicalSpace.induced (fun y : Y => (y : X)) t)` is the topology on A induced from Y when Y itself has the subspace topology from X.
  - `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : A => (a : X)) t` is the topology on A induced directly from X.
  - The theorem asserts these two topologies on A are equal: the subspace topology inherited via Y equals the subspace topology inherited directly from X.

- This precisely matches the natural language statement: if Y is a subspace of X and A ⊆ Y, then the topology A inherits as a subspace of Y equals the topology it inherits as a subspace of X.

- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts use standard Mathlib notions. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable here since we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language assertion.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_1a : ∃ f : Real → Real, (∀ x : Real, ∀ ε > (0 : Real), ∃ δ > (0 : Real), ∀ h : Real, abs h < δ → abs (f (x + h) - f (x - h)) < ε) ∧ ¬ Continuous f := by sorry`
  This states: There exists a function f: ℝ → ℝ such that for every real x and every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 with the property that for all h ∈ ℝ, if |h| < δ then |f(x + h) − f(x − h)| < ε; moreover, f is not continuous. The ε-δ clause is exactly the limit statement lim_{h→0} (f(x+h) − f(x−h)) = 0 for every x. The `¬ Continuous f` asserts that f is not continuous (as a function ℝ → ℝ with the standard topology).
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement. The comment suggests an example (the characteristic function of {0}), which indeed satisfies the symmetric difference limit and is not continuous at 0, aligning with the intended math.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that the property “for every x, lim_{h→0} (f(x+h) − f(x−h)) = 0” does not imply continuity; i.e., that a function with this property need not be continuous. This is equivalently shown by exhibiting existence of such an f that is not continuous.
- The Lean statement asserts exactly the existence of such an f, using the standard ε-δ formalization of the limit and the standard Mathlib notion of continuity. Thus, it faithfully captures the mathematical statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same in meaning. The Lean code presents the existence claim that witnesses the failure of implication. There are no extraneous assumptions or weakenings/strengthenings. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The use of ε-δ is the correct formalization of the limit condition.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_5 {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We fix a function f from ℝ to ℝ.
- `(h_diff : ∀ x, 0 < x → DifferentiableAt ℝ f x)`: For every real x with x > 0, f is differentiable at x.
- `(h_deriv : Filter.Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) Filter.atTop (nhds 0))`: The derivative function x ↦ f'(x) tends to 0 as x → +∞ (the atTop filter on ℝ).
- `: Filter.Tendsto (fun x => f (x + 1) - f x) Filter.atTop (nhds 0)`: The conclusion is that g(x) = f(x+1) − f(x) tends to 0 as x → +∞.
There are no auxiliary placeholder definitions; all notions (DifferentiableAt, deriv, Tendsto, atTop, nhds) are standard Mathlib concepts.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: f is defined and differentiable for every x > 0, and f'(x) → 0 as x → +∞. Define g(x) = f(x+1) − f(x). Show g(x) → 0 as x → +∞.
- Lean version assumes exactly: differentiable for x > 0 (h_diff) and the derivative tends to 0 at +∞ (h_deriv). The conclusion matches the limit of g(x) to 0 at +∞.
- The function g is represented as the map x ↦ f(x+1) − f(x). The limit is taken with respect to Filter.atTop on ℝ, which is the standard formalization of x → +∞.

3) Comparison and possible differences:
- Domain of f: The natural language states f is defined for x > 0, while the Lean code takes f : ℝ → ℝ. This is a benign generalization: having f defined on all ℝ is stronger than needed, but does not change the meaning of the theorem about behavior as x → +∞. The Lean hypothesis still asserts differentiability for all x > 0, matching the original assumption.
- Use of deriv: In Mathlib, deriv f x is a total function on ℝ; the code separately assumes differentiability for x > 0, ensuring that on the relevant tail (large x) deriv matches the true derivative. This aligns with the natural language requirement that f′ exists for x > 0 and tends to 0.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully formalizes the natural language statement, with only a harmless generalization of f's domain. The final statement matches the mathematical meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `rudin_exercise_5_3` takes as input a function `g : ℝ → ℝ`, an assumption that `g` is differentiable (`hg : Differentiable ℝ g`), a real bound `M : ℝ` together with `M_nonneg : 0 ≤ M`, and the bounded derivative condition `hM : ∀ x, |deriv g x| ≤ M`.
- The conclusion states: there exists ε ∈ ℝ such that `0 < ε` and the function `x ↦ x + ε * g x` is injective (`Function.Injective`).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: Suppose g has bounded derivative (|g'| ≤ M). Fix ε > 0 and define f(x) = x + ε g(x). Prove that f is one-to-one if ε is small enough. The standard mathematical reading of “if ε is small enough” is that there exists δ > 0 such that for all ε with 0 < ε < δ, the corresponding function f is injective. Equivalently, injectivity holds uniformly for all sufficiently small ε.
- The Lean statement only asserts the existence of some ε > 0 for which f is injective. It does not provide a threshold δ working for all ε below it. This is strictly weaker than the usual “for ε small enough” claim.
- Other aspects: requiring differentiability and a global bound on |g'| matches the hypothesis “bounded derivative” in the natural statement. The function defined is exactly f(x) = x + ε g(x). There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; there is a single theorem statement. So the only mismatch is the quantification over ε.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different: the Lean code proves ∃ ε > 0, f_ε injective, while the natural statement asserts ∃ δ > 0, ∀ ε ∈ (0, δ), f_ε injective. The Lean statement is a weaker existential claim and does not capture the uniform “for all sufficiently small ε” quantification.

Given that the only issue is this quantifier mismatch and everything else aligns, the translation is almost correct but not faithful.

  This states that the collection of all sets U in ℝ × ℝ that are of the form (a,b) × (c,d) with a, b, c, d rational and a < b, c < d, is a topological basis for ℝ × ℝ (with its usual topology). Here `Set.Ioo (a : ℝ) (b : ℝ)` denotes the open interval (a,b), and `×ˢ` denotes the set product, so these U are exactly open rectangles with rational endpoints.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that the countable collection {(a, b) × (c, d) | a < b and c < d, and a, b, c, d rational} is a basis for ℝ^2.”
- The Lean statement asserts that this collection is a topological basis for ℝ × ℝ. This captures the main claim: that these sets form a basis of the topology on ℝ^2.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Match: The sets are exactly open rectangles (a,b) × (c,d) with rational endpoints and the inequalities a < b, c < d, and the conclusion is that they form a (topological) basis for ℝ^2. This aligns with the standard topology on ℝ^2.
- Minor omission: The Lean statement does not explicitly assert that the collection is countable, whereas the natural-language statement describes the collection as “countable.” However, the core proposition to be shown is that it is a basis; the countability is a descriptive property of the collection rather than an explicit part of the claim being proven. The code faithfully captures the basis property, which is the essence of the exercise.

Overall, the translation is essentially faithful, with the only minor omission being the explicit countability claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def f (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) := x ^ n` defines the sequence of functions f_n on ℝ by f_n(x) = x^n. Although the natural language states domain [0,1], the later use of `TendstoUniformlyOn ... (Icc 0 1)` restricts attention precisely to [0,1], so this is faithful.
- `noncomputable def g (x : ℝ) : ℝ := if x = 1 then 1 else 0` defines the pointwise limit function g on ℝ which, when restricted to [0,1], is g(x)=0 for x in [0,1) and g(1)=1. This matches the standard pointwise limit of x^n on [0,1].
- `theorem not_uniform_convergence : ¬(TendstoUniformlyOn (fun n => f n) g atTop (Icc (0:ℝ) 1)) := by sorry` states that the sequence (f_n) does not converge uniformly to g on the set [0,1]. This is exactly the uniform non-convergence claim, formulated via `TendstoUniformlyOn` on the interval.

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
The original statement: Define f_n:[0,1] → ℝ by f_n(x)=x^n. Show that (f_n) does not converge uniformly. The Lean code defines f_n correctly (with ambient domain ℝ but restricts to [0,1] in the uniform convergence statement) and asserts the negation of uniform convergence to the known pointwise limit g. Since if (f_n) converged uniformly on [0,1], it would have to converge to its pointwise limit g, showing `¬ TendstoUniformlyOn ... g ...` is the correct formalization of “does not converge uniformly.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Natural language uses [0,1] as domain; Lean defines f on ℝ but evaluates uniform convergence on Icc (0) 1. This is equivalent for the property in question.
- Limit function: The natural statement doesn’t explicitly name g, but the standard (and necessary) target for uniform convergence is the pointwise limit g; Lean specifies it explicitly. This does not change the meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; all constructs (TendstoUniformlyOn, Icc) are standard Mathlib.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the statement.

  Translation: Let X and Y be types with topologies. Assume Y has a preorder and its topology is the order topology. Let f and g be functions from X to Y that are continuous. Then the set of points x in X such that f x ≤ g x is closed in X.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Y is an ordered set with the order topology; f, g: X → Y are continuous; show {x | f(x) ≤ g(x)} is closed in X.
- Lean: Exactly this, with Y carrying `[Preorder Y]` and `[OrderTopology Y]`. This is a potentially slight generalization (preorder rather than a strictly linear/partial order), but it is a standard formalization and does not weaken the statement’s meaning in a problematic way. X has a topological structure as required. The set is defined as `{ x | f x ≤ g x }` and the conclusion is `IsClosed` of that set.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions or placeholders are introduced; only the theorem statement is given with a `sorry` proof stub, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The math problems are the same. The only minor difference is allowing a preorder rather than a (possibly linear) order; this is a harmless generalization consistent with the concept of an order topology in Mathlib. The target set and the closedness property match exactly.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_17 (f : ℝ → ℝ)`: We consider a real-valued function on ℝ.
- `(hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 3 f (Icc (-1:ℝ) 1))`: f is 3-times continuously differentiable on the closed interval [-1,1].
- `(h1 : f (-1) = 0) (h2 : f 0 = 0) (h3 : f 1 = 1)`: The function values are f(-1)=0, f(0)=0, f(1)=1.
- `(h4 : deriv f 0 = 0)`: The derivative of f at 0 equals 0 (i.e., f'(0)=0).
- Conclusion: `∃ x ∈ Ioo (-1:ℝ) 1, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≥ 3`: There exists x in the open interval (-1,1) such that the third derivative of f at x is at least 3. Here `deriv (deriv (deriv f))` denotes the third derivative f''' as a function ℝ → ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement assumes f is three times differentiable on [-1,1], gives the same values f(-1)=0, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, and f'(0)=0, and concludes there is x in (-1,1) with f'''(x) ≥ 3.
- The Lean code states exactly these boundary/derivative conditions and the same conclusion about the third derivative. The only difference is that `ContDiffOn ℝ 3` is a slightly stronger hypothesis than merely “three times differentiable” (it requires continuity of derivatives up to order 3), and f is defined on ℝ rather than only on [-1,1]. These are standard and acceptable strengthenings for formalization and do not distort the mathematical content of the claim.
- Using `deriv` composed three times correctly represents the third derivative in Mathlib for functions ℝ → ℝ. Since the hypothesis gives `ContDiffOn` on the closed interval, the third derivative exists on the interior (-1,1), making the statement meaningful and faithful.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Differences: The code assumes `ContDiffOn ℝ 3` (C^3) rather than just thrice differentiable; and f is globally defined on ℝ (not just on [-1,1]). These are benign strengthenings/specializations and do not change the essence of the problem.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts. The theorem statement matches the mathematical meaning of the original.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem exists_fixed_point_Icc {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hf_cont : ContinuousOn f (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)) (hf_map : ∀ x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, f x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) : ∃ x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, f x = x := by sorry`
  This states: Let f be a function from ℝ to ℝ. Assume f is continuous on the closed interval [0,1] (ContinuousOn f (Icc 0 1)), and assume f maps [0,1] into itself (for all x in [0,1], f(x) is in [0,1]). Then there exists x in [0,1] such that f(x) = x.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: If X = [0,1] and f : X → X is continuous, then there exists x with f(x) = x. This is the 1D Brouwer fixed point theorem.
- The Lean theorem encodes f as a function ℝ → ℝ that is continuous on [0,1] and maps [0,1] into itself, and concludes the existence of a fixed point in [0,1]. This is a standard formalization of a continuous function f : [0,1] → [0,1] in Lean by using `ContinuousOn` and a mapping-into-self hypothesis.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- The Lean statement is essentially equivalent to the natural one. The only technical difference is that the Lean code defines f on all of ℝ but only requires continuity on [0,1] and that the image of [0,1] lies in [0,1]. This is entirely standard and faithful to the original: any continuous f : [0,1] → [0,1] yields such an f : ℝ → ℝ by extension/restriction, and conversely the hypotheses ensure the relevant behavior is within [0,1]. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions, and no auxiliary fake constructs. The conclusion matches exactly: existence of x ∈ [0,1] with f x = x.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type _}`: We fix an arbitrary type X (the underlying set).
- `open CompleteLattice`: We will use lattice operations (like Inf) on the type of topologies.
- `theorem TopologicalSpace.generateFrom_eq_Inf (A : Set (Set X)) : ...`: For any collection A of subsets of X, the statement asserts:
  `TopologicalSpace.generateFrom A = Inf ({ t : TopologicalSpace X | ∀ U ∈ A, @IsOpen X t U } : Set (TopologicalSpace X))`.
  In words: The topology generated by A equals the infimum (greatest lower bound) in the complete lattice of all topologies on X that contain A, i.e., the intersection of all topologies making every U in A open.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: If A is a subbasis for a topology on X, then the topology generated by A equals the intersection of all topologies on X that contain A.
- The Lean statement says exactly that equality, and it holds for any A, not just A that is already known to be a subbasis. This is a standard (slight) generalization; the intersection description of generateFrom does not require A to be a subbasis a priori.
- The set `{ t | ∀ U ∈ A, IsOpen U }` is exactly the set of topologies on X that contain A, and `Inf` in the complete lattice of topologies corresponds to the intersection topology.

3) Final check: are the problems the same?
- Yes, the Lean statement captures the same mathematical content, with a harmless generalization (no extra hypotheses). There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; it uses established Mathlib notions (`TopologicalSpace.generateFrom`, `Inf`, `IsOpen`).

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `def T_infty (X : Set ℕ) : Set (Set ℕ) := { U | (X \ U).Infinite ∨ (X \ U) = ∅ ∨ (X \ U) = X }`
  Natural language: For a given subset X of ℕ, define the collection T_infty(X) consisting of all subsets U of ℕ such that the relative complement X \ U is either infinite, or empty, or equal to all of X.
  Note: In the intended informal definition, U would be a subset of X; here U is a subset of ℕ, but later they take X = univ so this coincides with subsets of X.

- `def evens : Set ℕ := { n | n % 2 = 0 }` and `def odds : Set ℕ := { n | n % 2 = 1 }`
  Natural language: Define the sets of even and odd natural numbers.

- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_13_3b` states: there exist sets A, B ⊆ ℕ such that A ∈ T_infty(univ) and B ∈ T_infty(univ) but A ∪ B ∉ T_infty(univ).
  Natural language: For X = ℕ, there are two sets in the collection T_infty whose union is not in T_infty, so T_infty is not closed under unions (hence not a topology).
  The comment specifies a concrete choice: A = odds and B = evens \ {0}, whose complements in ℕ are infinite, while the complement of A ∪ B = ℕ \ {0} is {0}, which is neither infinite, nor empty, nor all of ℕ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original asks to show that the collection T_infty need not be a topology on X. Providing a counterexample with X = ℕ and exhibiting two sets in T_infty whose union is not in T_infty exactly demonstrates that T_infty may fail to be a topology. Thus the theorem statement captures the intended claim by showing non-closure under unions for some X.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The code specializes to X = ℕ (implemented as X = univ : Set ℕ), which is acceptable since the statement only requires showing that T_infty need not be a topology (an existence of a counterexample suffices).
- Minor technical mismatch: In the definition, T_infty(X) is a set of subsets of ℕ rather than subsets of X. However, because the counterexample takes X = univ, subsets of ℕ coincide with subsets of X, so this does not affect the correctness of the counterexample or the faithfulness to the statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful. The theorem is stated precisely to show failure of a topology axiom.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement by providing the appropriate formal setup and a theorem asserting a counterexample.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X]`: We work in a type X equipped with a metric (a metric space), and X is complete.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_21 (E : ℕ → Set X)`: Consider a sequence of subsets E n of X indexed by natural numbers.
- `(h_closed : ∀ n, IsClosed (E n))`: Each E n is closed.
- `(h_nonempty : ∀ n, (E n).Nonempty)`: Each E n is nonempty.
- `(h_mono : ∀ n, E n ⊇ E (n+1))`: The sequence is nested decreasing: E n ⊇ E n+1 for all n.
- `(h_bdd : ∀ n, ∃ (x0 : X) (R : ℝ), ∀ y ∈ E n, dist x0 y ≤ R)`: Each E n is bounded (there exists a center x0 and radius R so that all points y in E n satisfy dist x0 y ≤ R). This is a standard metric-space formulation of boundedness.
- `(h_diam : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x y, x ∈ E n → y ∈ E n → dist x y < ε)`: The diameters of E n tend to 0: for any ε > 0, eventually all pairwise distances of points in E n are < ε (which implies diam(E n) < ε eventually).
- Conclusion: `∃! x : X, x ∈ ⋂ n, E n`: There exists exactly one point x in the intersection of all E n. That is, the intersection consists of exactly one point.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: In a complete metric space X, if {E_n} is a sequence of closed, nonempty, bounded sets with E_n ⊇ E_{n+1} and diam E_n → 0, then the infinite intersection consists of exactly one point.
- Lean: Exactly the same hypotheses are assumed: completeness of X, each E n closed, nonempty, bounded, nested decreasing, and a precise formulation of diameters tending to 0. The conclusion matches “consists of exactly one point” via the unique existence quantifier over membership in the intersection.
- Indexing detail: The natural language writes ⋂_{n=1}^∞, while the Lean code indexes from ℕ (starting at 0). For a decreasing sequence, ⋂_{n≥0} E n = ⋂_{n≥1} E n, so this is a harmless convention difference.
- The definition of “bounded” in Lean is a standard equivalent metric characterization (contained in some ball), matching the natural language.
- The diameter condition is encoded via pairwise distances becoming arbitrarily small eventually; this is equivalent to diam(E_n) → 0 and is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check: The two problems are the same. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced, and all assumptions align with the original statement. The conclusion exactly captures “the intersection consists of exactly one point.” Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the standard math library.
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]` sets up two types X and Y equipped with topologies.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_22_2a` states: Given a function `p : X → Y` that is continuous (`hp : Continuous p`), a function `f : Y → X` that is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`), and the composition identity `hcomp : p ∘ f = id` (i.e., `p` has a continuous right inverse `f`), then for every subset `U : Set Y`, `IsOpen U ↔ IsOpen (p ⁻¹' U)`. The proof is omitted via `sorry` (acceptable for translation checking).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If `p : X → Y` is continuous and has a continuous right inverse `f : Y → X` with `p ∘ f = id_Y`, then `p` is a quotient map.
- A standard characterization of “`p` is a quotient map” is exactly: for all `U ⊆ Y`, `U` is open in `Y` iff `p⁻¹(U)` is open in `X` (often also including that `p` is continuous and surjective). Here, continuity of `p` is an explicit hypothesis (`hp`), and surjectivity follows from `p ∘ f = id_Y`.
- The theorem’s conclusion states the open set equivalence for all subsets `U : Set Y`, which is the quotient map property. Thus, it matches the intended conclusion. The comment in the code explicitly says they are using this equivalence to state the quotient property.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code does not package the conclusion as `QuotientMap p` (a Mathlib predicate), but instead states the defining open set equivalence explicitly. This is a faithful restatement of the quotient map property.
- Surjectivity is not separately stated, but it is implied by `p ∘ f = id`, so nothing essential is missing.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions, and the theorem is a straightforward formalization of the statement.
- Therefore, the mathematical content is the same.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} {ι : Sort*} (T : ι → TopologicalSpace X)` introduces a type X, an index type ι, and a family of topologies T_i on X.
- The theorem states there exists a unique topology t on X such that:
  (a) For all i and all sets s, if s is open in t then s is open in T i. This means t is contained in each T i (t ≤ T i in Mathlib's order, i.e., t is coarser than each T i).
  (b) For any other topology t' that is contained in all T i (i.e., for all i and s, IsOpen t' s → IsOpen (T i) s), then for all s, IsOpen t s → IsOpen t' s. This means t ≤ t' (the opens of t are included in the opens of t').

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement asks for a unique largest topology on X contained in all the T_α, i.e., the topology with as many open sets as possible among those contained in every T_α. Equivalently, for any t' with t' ≤ T_i for all i, we should have t' ≤ t. 
- The code's second condition asserts the reverse: t ≤ t'. That characterizes t as the smallest (coarsest) topology contained in all T_i, not the largest (finest). So the direction is inverted.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code asserts existence and uniqueness of the minimal topology among those contained in all T_i (which would be the indiscrete topology), whereas the problem asks for the maximal such topology (the intersection of the T_i). This is a substantive reversal.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the issue is solely the reversed maximality condition.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: If p: X → Y is an open map and A is open in X, then the restriction q: A → p(A) is an open map.

- The codomain `Subtype (p '' A)` corresponds precisely to the image p(A) equipped with the subspace topology from Y.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; q is a proper restriction map.

3) Final check and any differences:
- The only discrepancy is a minor typo in the comment (`p "" A` instead of `p '' A`), which does not affect the formal statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- `variable (X : ι → Type*) [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]`: For each i : ι, X i is a type with a topology.
- `variable (s : ∀ i, Set (X i))`: For each i, s i is a subset of X i.
- `variable (hs_countable : ∀ i, Countable (s i))`: Each s i is countable.
- `variable (hs_dense : ∀ i, Dense (s i))`: Each s i is dense in X i.
- The theorem: `theorem product_countable_dense : Countable (Set.range (fun f : ∀ i, X i => fun i => f i)) := by sorry`
  This asserts that the set `Set.range (fun f => fun i => f i)` is countable. But `fun f => fun i => f i` is the identity on the product type Π i, X i, so `Set.range` of this function is the entire set (univ) of the product space. Therefore the statement is: the whole product space Π i, X i (viewed as the set univ) is countable.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If ι is countable and each X i has a countable dense subset s i, then the product Π i, X i has a countable dense subset. The intended formal conclusion should be something like: there exists a subset T ⊆ Π i, X i such that T is countable and dense (i.e., `∃ T : Set (∀ i, X i), T.Countable ∧ Dense T`).
- The code's conclusion: claims the entire product set is countable (`Countable (univ : Set (∀ i, X i))`). It does not mention or use density at all, nor does it use the given subsets s i or their properties. It also does not assert existence of a dense subset.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a much stronger and generally false claim (that the whole product space is countable), and it does not reflect the intended theorem about the existence of a countable dense subset in the product. It also ignores the hypotheses `hs_countable` and `hs_dense`. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Summary of discrepancies:
- Missing existential quantification of a dense subset in the product.
- Missing the density predicate in the conclusion.
- Concludes countability of the entire product set instead of existence of a countable dense subset.
- Does not use the provided hypotheses at all.

Thus, the code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

- `frontier A` is the boundary of A in X, matching Bd A.
- No extra assumptions or missing conditions; no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.
- Any subtlety about nonemptiness of C is immaterial since the intersection hypotheses already enforce nonemptiness, and Mathlib’s `IsConnected` commonly includes nonemptiness.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex` just set up the environment and notation for complex numbers.
- The theorem statement: `theorem axler_exercise_1_2 : (((-1 : Complex) + Complex.I * (Real.sqrt 3 : Complex)) / 2) ^ 3 = 1 := by sorry`
  reads as: In the complex numbers, the number z = ((-1) + i * sqrt(3)) / 2 satisfies z^3 = 1. Here `Complex.I` is i, `Real.sqrt 3` is the real square root of 3 coerced into the complex numbers, and `/ 2` is division by 2 in ℂ. This is exactly the complex number (-1 + sqrt(3) i)/2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that ((-1 + sqrt(3) i)/2)^3 = 1. The Lean statement asserts precisely this equality in ℂ. Multiplication order `Complex.I * (Real.sqrt 3)` matches `sqrt(3) i` since complex multiplication is commutative. All type coercions are standard and faithful.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement exactly matches the claim that (-1 + sqrt(3) i)/2 is a cube root of 1 by asserting its cube equals 1. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def is_topology_on {X : Type _} (T : Set (Set X)) : Prop := ...` defines what it means for a collection T of subsets of X to be a topology: it contains ∅ and univ, is closed under finite intersections, and closed under arbitrary unions (expressed via sUnion).
- `inductive X : Type | a | b | c` introduces a concrete 3-point type X with elements a, b, c.
- `def s_a, s_b, s_c, s_ab, s_bc` define the specific subsets {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {b,c} of X.
- `def T1` and `def T2` define two collections of subsets of X: T1 = {∅, univ, {a}, {a,b}} and T2 = {∅, univ, {c}, {b,c}}.
- The theorem `union_of_topologies_not_topology` asserts the following conjunction: (i) T1 is a topology on X, (ii) T2 is a topology on X, (iii) {a,b} ∈ T1 ∪ T2, (iv) {b,c} ∈ T1 ∪ T2, and (v) {b} ∉ T1 ∪ T2. The docstring explains the intended conclusion: since {a,b} ∩ {b,c} = {b} and the union contains the two former but not the latter, T1 ∪ T2 is not closed under finite intersections, hence is not a topology.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: given a family of topologies on X, their union need not be a topology. The code constructs a specific example of two topologies T1 and T2 on a 3-point set whose union fails closure under finite intersections. This is exactly the standard counterexample proving the claim. While the theorem does not explicitly state ¬ is_topology_on (T1 ∪ T2), it provides the key facts that directly imply it.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code uses a specific finite family (two topologies), which is a valid special case of a general family and suffices to demonstrate that a union of topologies need not be a topology.
- All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no placeholders or vacuous definitions). The is_topology_on predicate faithfully encodes the topology axioms.
- The presence of `by sorry` omits the proof, but the task is to check translation, not proof. The statement encoded is faithful to the intended mathematics.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- The comment `/-- Every order topology is regular. -/` states the intended theorem in natural language.
- `theorem order_topology_regular {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α] [Preorder α] [OrderTopology α] : RegularSpace α := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type α equipped with a topology and a preorder, and assuming that this topology is the order topology associated to the preorder (i.e., we have an instance `[OrderTopology α]` that identifies the given topology as the order topology), then α is a regular space (`RegularSpace α`). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language claim is: ""Show that every order topology is regular."" The Lean statement says exactly: given α with a preorder and with a topology equal to its order topology, then α is a RegularSpace. This directly formalizes “every order topology is regular” within Mathlib’s framework (using the `OrderTopology` typeclass to assert that the given topology is the order topology).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it’s a single theorem statement with an omitted proof. This matches the guideline that no proofs are required and we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Scope: The Lean statement uses `[Preorder α]` rather than requiring a linear order; many treatments define order topologies for (pre)orders, and Mathlib’s `OrderTopology` is designed for preorders. This is, at worst, a slight generalization, which is acceptable per the guidelines.
- The target property is `RegularSpace α`, which corresponds to being regular. This matches the natural language.
- There are no hidden assumptions like T1 or Hausdorff beyond what `RegularSpace` entails in Mathlib, so the match is appropriate for the phrasing.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

The following theorem records this statement. A full proof is omitted (use `sorry`).
-/

theorem Munkres_exercise_20_2 : ∃ (m : MetricSpace (Real × Real)), True := by sorry
",1,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and contains a comment describing the informal statement: that R × R with the dictionary (lexicographic) order topology is metrizable.
- The theorem stated is: `theorem Munkres_exercise_20_2 : ∃ (m : MetricSpace (Real × Real)), True := by sorry`.
  In natural language, this asserts: there exists some metric space structure m on the type Real × Real, and (trivially) True holds. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement requires showing that the specific topological space (R × R) equipped with the dictionary (lexicographic) order topology is metrizable, i.e., there exists a metric whose induced topology equals the lexicographic order topology on R × R.
- The Lean theorem merely asserts the existence of some metric space structure on the underlying type Real × Real. It does not mention the dictionary order topology at all, nor does it require that the metric induce that topology. Moreover, `∃ m, True` is a vacuous/exceedingly weak statement, since any metric space structure on Real × Real would do, including the standard product metric, which induces the usual product topology, not the lexicographic one.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the issue is that the theorem statement itself omits the crucial content about the lexicographic order topology and compatibility of the metric-induced topology with it. In Mathlib, a faithful formalization would either:
  - define/equip (Real × Real) with the lexicographic order topology (e.g., via a lex order instance and `OrderTopology`), then state `MetrizableSpace (Real × Real)` with that topology; or
  - explicitly assert that there exists a metric on Real × Real whose induced topology equals the lex order topology.
- None of this is present.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean statement is far weaker and does not mention the dictionary order topology or any compatibility condition between the metric and that topology. It is essentially trivial and does not capture the substance of the original problem.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {ι : Type _} {X : ι → Type _} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]`: We have an index type ι and a family of types X i indexed by i ∈ ι, each equipped with a topological space structure. The dependent function type `(∀ i, X i)` carries the product topology (the Pi-topology in Mathlib).
- `lemma Munkres_exercise_32_2c (h : NormalSpace (∀ i, X i)) (hne : ∀ i, Nonempty (X i)) : ∀ i, NormalSpace (X i) := by sorry`: If the product space (the Pi-type) `(∀ i, X i)` is normal, and each factor `X i` is nonempty, then for every index i, the space `X i` is normal.

2) Faithfulness check:
The natural language statement says: If the product ∏ X_α is normal, then each X_α is normal, assuming each X_α is nonempty. In Lean, `(∀ i, X i)` represents the product ∏ X_i with the product topology. `NormalSpace (∀ i, X i)` expresses that the product is normal. `∀ i, NormalSpace (X i)` is exactly that each factor is normal. The nonemptiness assumption `∀ i, Nonempty (X i)` matches the given assumption. No extraneous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.

3) Final comparison:
The Lean lemma statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement: same assumptions (product normal, each factor nonempty) and same conclusion (each factor is normal). There are no discrepancies or vacuous placeholders.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's topology library.
- The docstring states: If X is regular, any two distinct points have neighborhoods with disjoint closures.
- `theorem munkres_exercise_31_1 {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [RegularSpace X] {x y : X} (hxy : x ≠ y) : ...`: Let X be a type with a topology and assume X is a regular space. Let x, y be points of X with x ≠ y.
- Conclusion: There exist sets U and V in X such that:
  - `IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V`: both U and V are open (so they are neighborhoods in the usual sense).
  - `x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V`: x is in U and y is in V.
  - `closure U ∩ closure V = ∅`: the closures of U and V are disjoint (their intersection is empty).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Show that if X is regular, every pair of points of X have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint."" This is standardly understood for distinct points, since a point cannot have two neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint from themselves if the points coincide. The Lean code makes this explicit via the hypothesis `x ≠ y`.
- Assumptions: Both use ""X is regular""; the Lean code uses `RegularSpace X`, a standard Mathlib typeclass, matching the notion of regularity.
- Conclusion: Existence of neighborhoods (open sets containing the points) whose closures are disjoint. The code encodes this precisely as `IsOpen`, membership, and `closure U ∩ closure V = ∅`.

Auxiliary definitions: None are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib notions. No vacuous placeholders.

Final check: The formal statement faithfully captures the intended mathematical statement, with the benign and customary clarification that the two points are distinct (necessary for the statement to be meaningful). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `variable {V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]` declares a type V that is an additive commutative group and a module over F. Over a field, a module is precisely a vector space, so this matches the natural language's vector space V over F.

  This states: for any a in F and v in V, if the scalar multiplication a • v equals the zero vector, then either a equals the zero scalar or v equals the zero vector. This is exactly the natural language statement. The use of `•` denotes scalar multiplication; `(0 : V)` and `(0 : F)` denote the zero in V and F respectively.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The formal statement precisely captures the natural language claim in the context of a vector space (module over a field). There are no extraneous or missing hypotheses.

3) Final check and differences:
- Quantification and implication structure match exactly: ""if a ∈ F, v ∈ V, and a v = 0, then a = 0 or v = 0"" corresponds to `a • v = 0 → a = 0 ∨ v = 0` for arbitrary `a, v`.
- The Lean assumptions `[Field F] [Module F V]` align with V being a vector space over F.

- `theorem locally_compact_t2_completely_regular {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [LocallyCompactSpace X] [T2Space X] : CompletelyRegularSpace X := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology, if X is locally compact (`[LocallyCompactSpace X]`) and Hausdorff (`[T2Space X]`), then X is completely regular (`CompletelyRegularSpace X`). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular.""
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly this: assuming X is a topological space that is locally compact and Hausdorff (T2), conclude it is completely regular. The class names `LocallyCompactSpace`, `T2Space`, and `CompletelyRegularSpace` are standard in Mathlib and correspond to the intended notions. Any potential convention where ""completely regular"" might or might not include T1 is harmless here because T2 implies T1, so the Lean statement still matches the common mathematical statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; no vacuous placeholders.
- No extra hypotheses beyond local compactness and Hausdorffness; no missing hypotheses.
- The statement quantifies over all X (""every""), matching the natural language.
- Therefore, the two statements are the same in meaning.

  ¬ LocallyCompactSpace ({ f : ℕ → ℝ | ∀ n, f n ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 }) := by sorry
",1,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The type { f : ℕ → ℝ | ∀ n, f n ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 } is the set of all sequences of real numbers indexed by ℕ whose values lie in [0,1]. This is (ℕ → ℝ) restricted to [0,1]-valued functions, i.e., the same underlying set as [0,1]^ω.
- The statement ¬ LocallyCompactSpace (...) asserts that this space is not locally compact, where the TopologicalSpace instance used is the default one on function spaces in Mathlib. For functions ℕ → ℝ, the default topology is the product (Pi) topology, i.e., the topology of pointwise convergence, coming from the product uniformity.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement explicitly says: Show that [0,1]^ω is not locally compact in the uniform topology. In Munkres, the “uniform topology” on a countable product of metric spaces refers to the topology induced by the sup metric (uniform convergence), which is strictly finer than the product topology. Under this uniform (sup) topology, [0,1]^ω is indeed not locally compact.
- The Lean code, however, does not specify or construct the uniform (sup) topology. It uses the default product topology on the function space. But with the product topology, [0,1]^ω is compact by Tychonoff’s theorem, hence locally compact. Therefore the Lean statement (¬ LocallyCompactSpace ...) in the product topology is false, and does not match the intended statement about the uniform topology.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical problems differ in the topology used. The natural statement concerns the uniform (sup) topology; the Lean code uses the product topology. Since local compactness depends crucially on the topology, this is a significant mismatch. No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are present, but the main theorem is about the wrong topology and asserts a false property for that topology. Thus the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: `{X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]` sets up topological spaces X and Y.
- `(p : X → Y)`: a function p from X to Y.
- `(h_surj : Function.Surjective p)`: p is surjective. This is part of the standard definition of a quotient map.
- `(h_quot : ∀ (U : Set Y), IsOpen U ↔ IsOpen (p ⁻¹' U))`: For every subset U of Y, U is open in Y if and only if its preimage under p is open in X. This equivalence implies continuity of p (the forward direction ensures preimages of open sets are open) and also the quotient (final) topology property. Together with surjectivity, this is exactly the usual definition of a quotient map.
- `(h_fiber : ∀ y : Y, IsPreconnected (p ⁻¹' ({y} : Set Y)))`: For every y in Y, the fiber p^{-1}({y}) is preconnected as a subset of X. In mathlib, IsConnected s ↔ s.Nonempty ∧ IsPreconnected s. Since p is surjective, each fiber is nonempty, so ""IsPreconnected"" here is equivalent to ""connected"" for the fibers, matching the natural language assumption.
- `(hY : ConnectedSpace Y)`: Y is connected as a topological space.
- Conclusion: `ConnectedSpace X`: X is connected.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""Let p: X → Y be a quotient map. If each fiber p^{-1}({y}) is connected and Y is connected, then X is connected.""
- The Lean assumptions `(h_surj, h_quot)` precisely encode that p is a quotient map (surjective and with the quotient topology condition). Continuity is implicit from `h_quot`. The fiber condition is expressed via `IsPreconnected`, which together with surjectivity yields connected fibers, aligning with the statement. The conclusion matches exactly.

Final check for differences:
- Using `IsPreconnected` instead of `IsConnected` for fibers is harmless and equivalent here due to surjectivity ensuring nonemptiness.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all are standard Mathlib predicates.
- The code does not use a dedicated `QuotientMap` predicate but provides equivalent hypotheses, which is acceptable and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib library.
- variable {K : Type _} [Field K]: K is a field.
- variable {V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]: V is a K-vector space (an additive commutative group with a K-module structure).
- variable (U W : Submodule K V): U and W are subspaces (submodules) of V.
- theorem Axler_exercise_1_9 : (∃ S : Submodule K V, (S : Set V) = (U : Set V) ∪ (W : Set V)) ↔ (U ≤ W ∨ W ≤ U): The statement asserts an equivalence. Left side: there exists a submodule S of V whose underlying set is exactly the union of the underlying sets of U and W. Right side: either U is contained in W or W is contained in U (≤ is the inclusion order on submodules). Proof omitted (by sorry), which is allowed for translation auditing.

Step 2: Assess whether the whole translation matches the original statement.
- The natural language statement: ""The union of two subspaces of V is a subspace of V if and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.""
- In Lean, saying “the union is a submodule” is naturally expressed as: there exists a Submodule S whose underlying set equals U ∪ W. This matches the left side of the equivalence.
- The right side directly matches “one subspace is contained in the other.”
- Therefore, the Lean theorem precisely formalizes the natural language equivalence.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; U, W, and S are genuine Submodule objects.
- The use of Field K and Module K V is appropriate for “subspaces.”
- The equivalence is stated exactly, with no extra hypotheses or weakened conclusions.
- Slight formalization detail (existential S) is the correct way to express “the union is a subspace” in Lean.

- The original inequality is `(∑_{j=1}^{n} a_j b_j)^2 ≤ (∑_{j=1}^{n} j a_j^2)(∑_{j=1}^{n} b_j^2 / j)` for real sequences `a_j, b_j`.
- Identifying `a_j := a i`, `b_j := b i`, and `j := i.val + 1`, the Lean sums match exactly: the left sum is the dot product sum over all indices; the right sums have weights `j` and `1/j` exactly as in the statement.
- Casting `j` to ℝ is standard and faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing difference: Lean uses `Fin n` with `i.val + 1` to represent j from 1 to n. This is a standard, faithful reindexing.
- Domain of n: The Lean statement allows `n = 0` (empty sums), which makes the inequality trivially true; the natural statement implicitly assumes `n ≥ 1`, but this is a harmless slight generalization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly encodes the inequality.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def U : Set (Real × Real) := { p : Real × Real | p.fst = 0 ∨ p.snd = 0 }`
  This defines U as the subset of R^2 consisting of all points (x, y) where x = 0 or y = 0, i.e., the union of the x-axis and y-axis.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_1_7 : (U ≠ ∅) ∧ (∀ (a : Real) (v : Real × Real), v ∈ U → (a * v.fst, a * v.snd) ∈ U) ∧ ¬ (∀ u v : Real × Real, u ∈ U → v ∈ U → (u.fst + v.fst, u.snd + v.snd) ∈ U) := by sorry`
  This theorem asserts three things:
  1) U is nonempty.
  2) U is closed under scalar multiplication by real numbers: for all real a and all v in U, the scalar multiple (a*v.fst, a*v.snd) is in U. This is exactly the coordinate-wise realization of scalar multiplication in R^2.
  3) U is not closed under addition: it is not the case that for all u, v in U their sum (u.fst + v.fst, u.snd + v.snd) is in U. This directly shows U is not a subspace.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks for an example of a nonempty subset U of R^2 that is closed under scalar multiplication but is not a subspace. The code provides a concrete U (the union of axes), states it is nonempty, proves closure under scalar multiplication (for all scalars), and asserts it is not closed under addition, hence not a subspace. This matches exactly the intended example and properties.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; U is a genuine set and the properties are the standard ones for R^2 with usual operations. Using coordinate expressions for scalar multiplication and addition is faithful to the vector space structure on R^2.

Final check:
- The math problems are the same: provide such a U with those properties. The code’s statements align precisely with the three required properties. There are no extraneous assumptions or weakenings/strengthenings.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`: We work with topological spaces X and Y, and assume Y is Hausdorff (T2).
- `variable {A : Set X} (f : Subtype A → Y)`: A is a subset of X, and f is a function from A (as a subtype) to Y.
- The theorem `extension_unique` takes two functions `g1 g2 : X → Y` that are continuous on `closure A` (via `ContinuousOn g1 (closure A)` and `ContinuousOn g2 (closure A)`), and assumes that both agree with f on A: `(h1 : ∀ x : Subtype A, g1 x.1 = f x)` and `(h2 : ∀ x : Subtype A, g2 x.1 = f x)`. The conclusion is `∀ x ∈ closure A, g1 x = g2 x`, i.e., the restrictions of g1 and g2 to `closure A` agree pointwise.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Original: Let A ⊆ X, f : A → Y continuous, Y Hausdorff. If f extends to a continuous g : cl(A) → Y, then g is uniquely determined by f.
- The Lean statement encodes the uniqueness: if two functions are continuous on cl(A) and agree with f on A, they agree on cl(A). This is exactly the uniqueness assertion for extensions to cl(A).
- Technical restatement: instead of considering functions defined on cl(A), the code considers functions X → Y that are continuous on cl(A). This is equivalent for the purpose of uniqueness of the restriction to cl(A).
- The code does not assume f is continuous. This hypothesis is not needed for uniqueness (only for existence), so omitting it is a harmless generalization consistent with the stated goal “the extension is unique.”
- Y Hausdorff is included via `[T2Space Y]`.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task as we only check the statement.

Final check:
- Both statements assert the same mathematical content: uniqueness of a continuous extension to cl(A) into a Hausdorff space, determined by agreement on A. The Lean code presents this as a two-function uniqueness property, which is standard and equivalent.
- No mismatches affecting meaning; differences are standard formalization choices and a slight generalization (dropping continuity of f) that does not harm faithfulness.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_28_4 {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [T1Space X] :` sets up a theorem for an arbitrary type X endowed with a topology and assuming X is a T1 space.
- Left side of `↔`:
  `∀ (U : ℕ → Set X), (∀ n, IsOpen (U n)) → (⋃ n, U n) = Set.univ → ∃ S : Finset ℕ, (⋃ n ∈ (S : Set ℕ), U n) = Set.univ`
  This says: for every sequence of subsets U indexed by ℕ, if each U n is open and the union over all n equals the whole space, then there exists a finite set of indices S such that the union of U n over n in S still equals the whole space. This is exactly “every countable open cover has a finite subcover”.
- Right side of `↔`:
  `∀ s : Set X, s.Infinite → ∃ x : X, ∀ U : Set X, IsOpen U → x ∈ U → ((s \ {x}) ∩ U).Nonempty`
  This says: for every subset s of X, if s is infinite, then there exists a point x in X such that for every open set U containing x, the intersection of U with s minus {x} is nonempty. This is precisely the statement that s has a limit (accumulation) point x, i.e., every infinite subset has a limit point. This is a standard formulation of limit point compactness.
There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; all terms are from Mathlib (TopologicalSpace, T1Space, IsOpen, Set, Finset, union, Nonempty).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The theorem is stated under the assumption `[T1Space X]`, as in the natural language problem which asks to show the equivalence for a T1 space.
- The left predicate formalizes countable compactness via ℕ-indexed open covers and finite subcovers.
- The right predicate formalizes limit point compactness: every infinite subset has a limit (accumulation) point.
- Using ℕ as the indexing set for countable covers is standard and faithful.
Thus, the equivalence in the theorem matches exactly “for a T1 space X, countable compactness is equivalent to limit point compactness.”

3) Comparison and differences:
- No substantive differences. The formalization uses equality to Set.univ to express “covers X,” which is standard. It quantifies over open sets containing x for the limit point condition, which is equivalent to quantifying over all neighborhoods. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The code cleanly captures the intended equivalence.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Universes and structures: K is a DivisionRing, V and W are additive commutative groups with K-module structures. This is the standard setup for linear maps over a division ring (a slight generalization of the usual field case). FiniteDimensional K V assumes V is finite-dimensional over K, matching the hypothesis.
- T : V →ₗ[K] W declares T is a K-linear map from V to W, i.e., T ∈ L(V, W).
- The statement: ∃ (U : Submodule K V), U ⊓ LinearMap.ker T = ⊥ ∧ LinearMap.range T = Submodule.map T U
  • U : Submodule K V means U is a subspace of V.
  • U ⊓ LinearMap.ker T = ⊥ means the intersection of U with ker T is {0}.
  • LinearMap.range T = Submodule.map T U means the range of T equals the image of U under T; i.e., range T = {T u | u ∈ U}.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks: given V finite-dimensional and T ∈ L(V, W), prove there exists a subspace U of V such that U ∩ null T = {0} and range T = {T u : u ∈ U}. The Lean formulation matches this exactly:
  • ""null T"" corresponds to LinearMap.ker T.
  • The intersection condition is expressed as U ⊓ ker T = ⊥.
  • The description of the range via U is expressed as range T = map T U, which is precisely {T u | u ∈ U}.
- The use of a DivisionRing instead of a Field is a benign generalization and acceptable per the guidelines; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the theorem statement itself is the translation.

Final check:
- The math problems are the same: existence of a subspace U complementary to the kernel (in the sense of trivial intersection) whose image under T equals the entire range. The Lean code faithfully encodes this statement.

  • ∀ g x, x ∈ connectedComponent 1 → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ connectedComponent 1: Closed under conjugation by arbitrary g, i.e., normality.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement asks to show that C, the component (conventionally the connected component) of G containing the identity e, is a normal subgroup of G. The Lean statement specifies exactly the subgroup axioms (identity in C, closure under multiplication and inverses) and adds closure under conjugation by any element, which is the defining property of a normal subgroup. The set used is connectedComponent (1 : G), i.e., the connected component containing the identity.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- “Component” vs “connected component”: In standard topology, “component” means connected component; Lean uses connectedComponent, so this matches.
- The code presents the subgroup and normality properties in elementwise form rather than packaging as a Subgroup/NormalSubgroup structure, but this is mathematically equivalent to saying “C is a normal subgroup.”
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

- The sum is taken in ℚ, and the non-integrality is expressed as negation of existence of an integer equal to the sum.

The natural language statement: “Suppose S, T ∈ L(V).

The custom `is_eigenvalue` definition matches the standard notion.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Scope/assumptions: The code assumes finite-dimensionality; the natural language statement did not explicitly state this but in standard texts (e.g., Axler) this exercise is in the finite-dimensional setting. This is a slight specialization, not a mismatch.
- Definitions: The `is_eigenvalue` definition is legitimate and faithful; no vacuous placeholders.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_43_2 {X Y : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y] [CompleteSpace Y] {A : Set X}`: X and Y are metric spaces, Y is complete, and A is a subset of X.
- `(f : ↥A → Y) (hf : UniformContinuous f)`: f is a function from the subtype A to Y, and f is uniformly continuous (with respect to the induced metric on A).
- Goal: `∃! (g : ↥(closure A) → Y), (∀ a : ↥A, g ⟨a.1, subset_closure a.2⟩ = f a) ∧ UniformContinuous g`.
  - There exists a unique function g from the subtype `closure A` to Y such that
    - For every `a ∈ A`, viewed as a point in `closure A` via `⟨a, subset_closure a.2⟩`, we have `g(a) = f(a)` (so g extends f), and
    - g is uniformly continuous.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For metric spaces X, Y with Y complete, and A ⊂ X, if f: A → Y is uniformly continuous, then f can be uniquely extended to a continuous function g: \bar{A} → Y, and g is uniformly continuous.
- Lean: Asserts existence and uniqueness of an extension g: closure A → Y that is uniformly continuous and agrees with f on A (embedded into its closure). Since uniformly continuous implies continuous, Lean’s g is continuous as well.

Potential discrepancy:
- The uniqueness in Lean is stated among extensions that are uniformly continuous (the ∃! quantifies over g with the property “extends f and is uniformly continuous”). The natural language statement phrases uniqueness among continuous extensions: there is a unique continuous extension, and moreover it is uniformly continuous.
- This is a subtle difference: Lean’s uniqueness is a priori weaker (it does not explicitly rule out the hypothetical existence of a different continuous-but-not-uniformly-continuous extension). However, in the metric setting, any two continuous maps from closure A to Y agreeing on dense A are equal (Y is Hausdorff), so the unique uniformly continuous extension is also the unique continuous extension. Thus, mathematically, the Lean statement still captures the intended theorem, and the missing “continuous” in the uniqueness predicate does not change the content because UniformContinuous implies Continuous and uniqueness among continuous extensions follows from general topology.

Other checks:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib ones.
- The extension property is correctly expressed via the canonical inclusion A → closure A using `subset_closure`.
- The completeness assumption is on Y, as required.

Conclusion:
- The code is essentially a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. The only minor deviation is that the uniqueness is phrased for uniformly continuous extensions rather than continuous ones; but since uniform continuity implies continuity and uniqueness among continuous maps follows in this context, the translation is practically faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem Axler_exercise_5_24 {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module ℝ V] [FiniteDimensional ℝ V]`: Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
- `(T : V →ₗ[ℝ] V)`: Let T be a real-linear endomorphism on V.
- `(h_no_eig : ¬ ∃ (r : ℝ) (v : V), v ≠ 0 ∧ T v = r • v)`: T has no real eigenvalues; i.e., there does not exist a real scalar r and a nonzero vector v with Tv = r v.
- `(U : Submodule ℝ V)`: Let U be a real subspace (submodule) of V.
- `(h_inv : ∀ u, u ∈ U → T u ∈ U)`: U is T-invariant: whenever u ∈ U, then T(u) ∈ U.
- `∃ k : ℕ, Module.finrank ℝ U = 2 * k`: The (finite) dimension of U over ℝ is an even integer; there exists k ∈ ℕ such that dim U = 2k.

Step 2: Assess whether the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
Original statement: ""Suppose V is a real vector space and T ∈ L(V) has no eigenvalues. Prove that every subspace of V invariant under T has even dimension.""

The Lean statement asserts exactly this for finite-dimensional V: given a real linear operator with no real eigenvalues, any T-invariant subspace U has even (finite) dimension. The formalization of ""no eigenvalues"" as no real eigenpairs (r, v) with Tv = r•v is correct in the real setting. The invariance condition is correctly encoded. The conclusion expresses that the dimension is even via finrank equals 2*k.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean code explicitly assumes V is finite-dimensional. The original statement does not mention finiteness. However, the notion of ""even dimension"" generally presumes finite dimension in this context, and this is a standard and natural clarification. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all concepts are from Mathlib.
- Aside from the finite-dimensional assumption, the formalization aligns with the mathematical content: real vector space, real linear operator without real eigenvalues, invariant subspace implies even dimension.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful and appropriate formalization, with a standard finite-dimensional clarification that matches the intended meaning of ""even dimension.""

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem statement is:
  theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_3_10 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (hcomp : ¬ Nat.Prime n) (hne : n ≠ 4) : (Nat.factorial (n - 1)) % n = 0
  Natural language: For a natural number n with n ≥ 2, not prime, and n ≠ 4, the remainder of (n − 1)! upon division by n is 0. Equivalently, n divides (n − 1)!, i.e., (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod n).
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a proof placeholder (sorry). The use of % n = 0 is a standard way to express congruence to 0 modulo n (under n > 0, ensured by hn: 2 ≤ n).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Original: ""If n is not a prime, show that (n-1)! ≡ 0 (mod n), except when n = 4.""
- Lean: Assumes n ≥ 2, ¬Prime n, and n ≠ 4, and concludes (n−1)! % n = 0. This matches the intended statement: for all non-prime n other than 4, we have (n-1)! ≡ 0 (mod n).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean version imposes n ≥ 2. The original phrasing ""not prime"" typically already presumes the context n ≥ 2 (and often the exercise is about composite n). Even if ""not prime"" allowed n = 1, the restriction to n ≥ 2 is a harmless specialization, and standard for such modular statements to avoid the degenerate modulus 0 or 1 cases. The exceptional case n = 4 is explicitly excluded in the Lean hypothesis, matching ""except when n=4.""
- The Lean formulation uses % n = 0 rather than a ModEq predicate; under n ≥ 2, these are equivalent to congruence to 0 modulo n.
- No vacuous placeholders or misleading auxiliary definitions are present.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (a slight, standard specialization n ≥ 2) of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {R : Type*} [Semiring R]` and `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommMonoid V] [Module R V]` set up a general module V over a semiring R. This is a slight generalization of a vector space over a field, but acceptable for the statement.
- The theorem `Axler_exercise_5_1 {m : ℕ} (U : Fin m → Submodule R V) (T : V →ₗ[R] V)` states: given m submodules U_i of V (indexed by `Fin m`) and a linear endomorphism T of V.
- The hypothesis `(h : ∀ i, Submodule.map T (U i) ≤ U i)` says: for each i, T(U_i) ⊆ U_i; i.e., each U_i is T-invariant.
- The conclusion `Submodule.map T (Submodule.span R (⋃ i, (U i : Set V))) ≤ Submodule.span R (⋃ i, (U i : Set V))` says: T of the submodule generated by the union of all the U_i is contained in that same submodule. Since `Submodule.span R (⋃ i, (U i : Set V))` is exactly the sum U₁ + ⋯ + U_m (the least submodule containing all the U_i), this asserts that the sum is T-invariant.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), but our task is to audit the statement translation, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If U₁, …, U_m are T-invariant subspaces, then U₁ + ⋯ + U_m is T-invariant.
- Lean: If each U_i satisfies T(U_i) ⊆ U_i, then T fixes the submodule `span (⋃ i, U_i)`, which is the sum U₁ + ⋯ + U_m. This directly matches the intended statement. Using modules over a semiring instead of vector spaces over a field is a standard slight generalization and faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Finite family `Fin m` matches U₁, …, U_m.
- Invariance: Expressed as `Submodule.map T (U i) ≤ U i`, which is the standard formalization of T-invariance.
- Sum: Represented as `Submodule.span R (⋃ i, (U i : Set V))`, which equals the sum of the submodules. No mismatch.
- Slight generalization from vector spaces to modules over a semiring is acceptable per guidelines.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_5_13 {K : Type _} [Field K] {V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] [FiniteDimensional K V] (T : V →ₗ[K] V)`: Sets up a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field K, with a linear endomorphism T.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ (φ : V →ₗ[K] K), φ ≠ 0 → Submodule.map T (LinearMap.ker φ) ≤ LinearMap.ker φ`: For every nonzero linear functional φ on V, T maps ker φ into itself, i.e., each kernel of a nonzero functional (every hyperplane) is T-invariant.
- Conclusion `∃ (c : K), T = c • LinearMap.id`: There exists a scalar c ∈ K such that T equals c times the identity linear map.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted (not relevant for translation fidelity per the instructions).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural statement: If every subspace of V of dimension dim V − 1 is invariant under T, then T is a scalar multiple of the identity.
- The Lean hypothesis quantifies over all nonzero linear functionals φ and asserts T(ker φ) ⊆ ker φ. In a finite-dimensional vector space over a field, every codimension-1 subspace is the kernel of some nonzero linear functional, and conversely. Thus the hypothesis exactly captures “every subspace of V of codimension 1 is invariant under T.”
- The conclusion exactly matches “T is a scalar multiple of the identity.”
- The added assumption `[FiniteDimensional K V]` is natural and aligns with the use of “dim V − 1” in the natural language (which presumes finite dimension). No extra or missing assumptions.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- No auxiliary fake definitions; no vacuous placeholders besides an omitted proof, which is allowed.
- The equivalence between codimension-1 subspaces and kernels of nonzero functionals is standard and valid in this context.
- The invariance is expressed correctly via `Submodule.map T S ≤ S`.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Natural language unpacking:
- X is a type with a given topology, compact, and Hausdorff.
- X1, X2 are subsets of X.
- hcover: X1 ∪ X2 = univ, i.e., X is covered by X1 and X2.
- hcl1, hcl2: X1 and X2 are closed in X.
- m1: There exists a metric space structure on the subtype Subtype X1 (the set X1 seen as a type of pairs {x // x ∈ X1}).
- m2: Likewise for Subtype X2.
- Conclusion: There exists a metric space structure on X.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement
Original statement: Let X be compact Hausdorff and the union of the closed subspaces X1 and X2. If X1 and X2 are metrizable, show X is metrizable.

Key mathematical meaning:
- ""X1 and X2 are metrizable"" means their subspace topologies (inherited from X) are metrizable; equivalently, there exist metrics whose induced topologies coincide with those subspace topologies.
- ""X is metrizable"" means the given topology on X is induced by some metric; in mathlib this is captured by MetrizableSpace X (or an explicit metric whose TopologicalSpace.ofMetric equals the given topology).

The Lean statement, however, uses:
- Assumptions: Nonempty (MetricSpace (Subtype X1)) and Nonempty (MetricSpace (Subtype X2)). This only asserts the existence of some metric structure on the underlying subtype types, with no requirement that the metric induces the inherited subspace topology. It does not use MetrizableSpace (Subtype X1) or any compatibility condition with the existing TopologicalSpace.
- Conclusion: Nonempty (MetricSpace X), i.e., there exists some metric structure on X, with no requirement that it induces the given topology on X. This is strictly weaker than “X is metrizable” in the topological sense.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The core property (metrizability) is mistranslated. The natural statement concerns topological metrizability (compatibility with the existing topology), whereas the Lean code merely asserts existence of some metric structure, unconstrained by the given topology. This is a significant mismatch both in the hypotheses (for X1, X2) and in the conclusion (for X).
- Other aspects (compactness, Hausdorff, closedness, cover by union) are correctly reflected.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the incorrect encoding of “metrizable” as Nonempty (MetricSpace …) rather than a topology-compatible notion like MetrizableSpace … or an explicit compatibility condition.

- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_1_19a (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z = 1) : ¬ Summable fun n : ℕ => (n : Complex) * z ^ n := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z with |z| = 1, the series with general term (n:ℂ) * z^n is not summable (i.e., the infinite series ∑ n z^n does not converge). No auxiliary definitions are introduced.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""Prove that the power series ∑ n z^n does not converge on any point of the unit circle.""
- ""does not converge on any point of the unit circle"" means: for every z with |z| = 1, the series ∑ n z^n diverges.
- Lean statement: For any z with Complex.abs z = 1, ¬ Summable (n ↦ (n:ℂ) * z^n). This is exactly the formalization of the same claim (non-summability for each point on the unit circle).

Step 3: Final check of potential discrepancies.
- Domain: Complex numbers, matching the usual context.
- Unit circle: expressed as |z| = 1, correct.
- Series: terms are (n:ℂ) * z^n, matching ∑ n z^n in the statement (with coefficient n).
- Convergence notion: Summable corresponds to (possibly conditional) convergence of the series, as intended.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable as we are only auditing the statement's faithfulness.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {V : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup V] [InnerProductSpace ℂ V] [FiniteDimensional ℂ V]`:
  V is a finite-dimensional complex inner-product space (the instances imply V is a complex inner product space; finite-dimensionality is explicitly assumed).

  In words: Let T be a linear operator on V over ℂ. Assume T is normal, expressed by T ∘ T* = T* ∘ T (where `LinearMap.adjoint T` is the adjoint of T with respect to the inner product). Then there exists a linear operator S on V such that S ∘ S = T (i.e., S^2 = T). No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the adjoint is Mathlib’s standard notion for linear maps on finite-dimensional inner product spaces.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Natural language: ""Suppose V is a complex inner-product space. Prove that every normal operator on V has a square root (S^2 = T).""
- Lean: Assumes V is a finite-dimensional complex inner-product space and asserts: for every normal T, there exists S with S^2 = T. This exactly formalizes “every normal operator has a square root,” with the normality condition made precise as T commutes with its adjoint.

3) Comparison and discrepancies:
- The only difference is the explicit finite-dimensional assumption in the Lean code. The natural statement does not explicitly say finite-dimensional, but in the common context (e.g., Axler) V is finite-dimensional. Moreover, the finite-dimensional assumption is a standard specialization that makes the statement true and allows use of `LinearMap.adjoint`. This is a mild specialization, acceptable per the guidelines, and the rest of the formulation precisely matches the notion of a square root and normal operator.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are from Mathlib and meaningful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization, with a slight and reasonable specialization to finite-dimensional spaces.

  Natural language translation: For any integer `a` and natural numbers `n, m`, if `a ≠ 0` and `n > m`, then the greatest common divisor of `a^(2^n) + 1` and `a^(2^m) + 1` equals `2` if `a` is even (i.e., `a % 2 = 0`), and equals `1` if `a` is odd.
  There are no auxiliary definitions; it's a single theorem with an unproved proof (sorry), which is acceptable for the purpose of translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: If `a` is a nonzero integer and `n > m`, then gcd(...) is 1 or 2 depending on whether `a` is odd or even. The mathematically correct refinement is: gcd = 1 if `a` is even, and gcd = 2 if `a` is odd.
- The Lean code states the opposite mapping: it asserts gcd = 2 if `a` is even (`a % 2 = 0`), else 1 if `a` is odd. This reverses the parity cases.

3) Final comparison:
- Quantifiers and conditions (`a ≠ 0`, `n > m`) match.
- The dependency on parity is expressed, but the mapping is incorrect: the code gives even → 2, odd → 1, whereas the intended (and standard) statement is even → 1, odd → 2. Hence the translation is not faithful.

No other discrepancies are present, and there are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. The single issue is the reversed parity condition in the conclusion.

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
The original says: “Prove that the power series ∑ z^n/n converges at every point of the unit circle except z = 1.” The Lean statement quantifies over an arbitrary z with ‖z‖=1 and z≠1, and asserts summability of the shifted series `∑ z^(n+1)/(n+1)` over `n : ℕ`. This is precisely the standard formalization of ∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n converging at such z.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing shift: Lean uses `n : ℕ` starting at 0 with term `z^(n+1)/(n+1)`, which is equivalent to the natural-language series starting at n=1. This is a standard, faithful technical adjustment.
- “Unit circle” is encoded as `‖z‖ = 1`; exclusion of `z = 1` is explicit. No extra assumptions; no missing cases. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.

  Natural language: Let n be a natural number with n ≥ 1, and let p be a natural number such that p = 2^(2^n) + 1 and p is prime.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:

- The Lean code explicitly enforces the definition of a Fermat prime by writing p = 2^(2^n) + 1 and assuming p.Prime. This matches the intended meaning of “Fermat prime.” The code also adds the condition n ≥ 1, which excludes the case p = 3 (corresponding to n = 0 in the standard Fermat prime parameterization), where 3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) is not a unit and hence cannot be a primitive root. The conclusion uses `IsPrimitiveRoot (3 : ZMod p) (p - 1)`, which is the standard formalization of “3 is a primitive root modulo p.”

3) Differences:
- The code assumes n ≥ 1, excluding p = 3. The natural language statement does not state this exclusion explicitly; as written, it would include p = 3 and thus be false there. The code therefore makes a slight strengthening to the hypothesis to ensure the statement is correct. This is a minor and standard adjustment and does not change the essence of the intended theorem.
- The code parameterizes the Fermat prime explicitly as p = 2^(2^n) + 1 rather than writing “p = 2^n + 1 is a Fermat prime.” This is equivalent to the definition of a Fermat prime and thus faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization with a mild additional hypothesis (n ≥ 1) to rule out the exceptional case p = 3. This is a slight specialization but standard and acceptable.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The theorem states: `(∑' n : ℕ, if n = 0 ∨ ¬Squarefree n then (0 : ENNReal) else ENNReal.ofReal (1 / (n : ℝ))) = (⊤ : ENNReal)`.
  In words: Consider the infinite sum over natural numbers n. For terms where n = 0 or n is not squarefree, contribute 0; otherwise contribute 1/n (interpreted as a nonnegative extended real via `ENNReal.ofReal`). The total sum is equal to `⊤` (infinity) in `ENNReal`. This asserts that the sum over positive squarefree integers of 1/n diverges to infinity.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that ∑' 1/n, the sum being over square free integers, diverges.” The Lean statement sums over ℕ, explicitly zeroing out n = 0 and non-squarefree n, thus effectively summing 1/n over positive squarefree integers. It concludes the sum equals `⊤` in `ENNReal`, i.e., diverges to +∞. Since all terms are nonnegative, divergence implies divergence to +∞, so this is an accurate formalization.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Index set: The Lean code sums over ℕ (nonnegative integers) and excludes 0; this corresponds to summing over positive squarefree integers, which is the standard interpretation. The natural statement mentions “square free integers” without specifying sign, but the conventional reading is positive integers for such sums. Including negative integers would not change the phenomenon except for absolute values; the Lean choice is standard and faithful.
- Codomain and notion of divergence: The Lean code uses `ENNReal` and states the sum equals infinity, which precisely captures divergence for a series of nonnegative terms. This is an acceptable and faithful formalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; it relies on Mathlib's `Squarefree` and standard summation machinery.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat` are just setup.
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_5_28 {p : Nat} (hp : p.Prime) (hmod4 : p % 4 = 1) : ... := by sorry`
  This states: For a natural number p, assuming p is prime (hp) and p ≡ 1 (mod 4) (encoded as p % 4 = 1), the following equivalence holds.
- Left side: `(∃ x : Nat, (x ^ 4) % p = 2 % p)` means there exists a natural number x such that x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) (equality of remainders is standard for congruence modulo p when p > 0, which follows from p ≡ 1 mod 4).
- Right side: `(∃ A B : Nat, p = A ^ 2 + 64 * B ^ 2)` means there exist natural numbers A, B such that p = A^2 + 64 B^2.
- The statement is an “if and only if” between the existence of a solution to x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) and p being representable as A^2 + 64 B^2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that x^4 ≡ 2 (p) has a solution for p ≡ 1 (4) iff p is of the form A^2 + 64 B^2.” Interpreted precisely, this asserts: For p with p ≡ 1 (mod 4), x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) is solvable iff p = A^2 + 64 B^2 for some integers (or naturals) A, B.
- The Lean statement matches the structure exactly: an equivalence between the congruence solvability and the quadratic form representation, under the hypothesis p ≡ 1 (mod 4).
- The code additionally assumes p is prime. This is a common and likely intended hypothesis for this classical result (as in Ireland & Rosen Ex. 5.28). The use of Nat instead of Int for A, B is fine since squares remove signs. The expression of congruence via `%` is a standard formalization.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Main difference: the Lean code includes the additional hypothesis `p.Prime`, which is not explicitly stated in the natural language sentence. In the standard theorem, p is indeed a prime, so this is a natural and likely intended restriction. Otherwise, there are no extraneous or vacuous definitions, and no placeholders; the theorem statement directly matches the claim.
- Minor formalization details (using Nat, equalities of remainders) do not change the mathematical meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to the (likely intended) prime assumption. Assigning a high grade with a small deduction for the added explicit hypothesis.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard libraries.
- The theorem statement: `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_4_4 {p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (h4 : p % 4 = 1) {a : ZMod p} : IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1) ↔ IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) (p - 1)`
  - Interprets: Let p be a natural number that is prime (`hp : p.Prime`) and satisfies p ≡ 1 (mod 4) (`h4 : p % 4 = 1`). Let a be an element of ZMod p (integers modulo p). Then, a is a primitive (p − 1)-th root of unity in ZMod p if and only if −a is a primitive (p − 1)-th root of unity in ZMod p.

Assessment of meaning:
- In ZMod p with p prime, ZMod p is a field, and “IsPrimitiveRoot a (p − 1)” means a has multiplicative order exactly p − 1, i.e., a generates the multiplicative group (nonzero elements), which is the standard notion of “a is a primitive root modulo p.” Thus the Lean statement precisely encodes “a is a primitive root modulo p iff −a is a primitive root modulo p.”
- The hypothesis `h4 : p % 4 = 1` matches “p is of the form 4t + 1,” since for naturals this is equivalent to p ≡ 1 mod 4 (and hence there exists t with p = 4t + 1). The prime assumption matches the natural language statement’s “Consider a prime p.”
- The use of `a : ZMod p` matches “a modulo p.” No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions at all.

Final check:
- The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with the standard mathlib notion of primitive root in ZMod p corresponding to a generator of the multiplicative group modulo p. The equivalence is stated exactly as in the problem.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem putnam_exercise_2018_a5 (f : ℝ → ℝ) ...` sets up a theorem about a real-valued function on the reals.
- `(hf_smooth : ContDiff ℝ ⊤ f)` means f is C^∞ (infinitely differentiable) over ℝ.
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)` corresponds to f(0) = 0.
- `(h1 : f 1 = 1)` corresponds to f(1) = 1.
- `(hnonneg : ∀ x, f x ≥ 0)` corresponds to f(x) ≥ 0 for all real x.
- Conclusion: `∃ (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ), n ≥ 1 ∧ (fun x => (Deriv^[n]) f x) x < 0` asserts there exist a natural number n and a real x such that n ≥ 1 and the n-th derivative of f at x is negative. Here `(Deriv^[n]) f` is the n-fold iterate of the derivative operator, i.e., the n-th derivative, and then evaluating at x gives f^{(n)}(x). The lambda `(fun x => (Deriv^[n]) f x) x` is redundant but equivalent to `((Deriv^[n]) f) x`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The hypotheses exactly match: f is C^∞, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(x)≥0 for all x.
- The conclusion matches: there exists a positive integer n (encoded as n ∈ ℕ with n ≥ 1) and a real x such that f^{(n)}(x) < 0.
- The use of `Deriv^[n]` is the standard Mathlib way to denote the n-th derivative, making the formulation faithful.

- No extraneous assumptions are added; `ContDiff ℝ ⊤ f` is exactly the infinite differentiability required.
- No weakening or strengthening of the statement occurs.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib constructs.

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
- The natural language claim is: ""Prove that there are unique positive integers a, n such that a^{n+1} − (a+1)^n = 2001.""
- The Lean statement quantifies over pairs (a, n) in ℕ × ℕ with constraints a > 0 and n > 0, and the same equation. The uniqueness is expressed via `∃!` (exists unique). This is exactly the same content as the natural statement, with a and n corresponding to p.1 and p.2.

3) Final check / possible nuances:
- Subtraction is in ℕ (natural-number subtraction). However, since it is set equal to 2001 > 0, this forces the left difference to be positive, so natural-number subtraction agrees with integer subtraction here; no mismatch arises.
- Uniqueness of the ordered pair (a, n) is equivalent to uniqueness of positive integers a and n satisfying the equation.
- Exponents and expressions match exactly: a^(n+1) and (a+1)^n.
There are no auxiliary definitions; no placeholders; the theorem statement faithfully encodes the problem.

  The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is the focus here.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: ""Prove that all entire functions that are also injective take the form f(z) = a z + b, a, b ∈ ℂ and a ≠ 0.""
- In Lean, `Differentiable ℂ f` for f: ℂ → ℂ means f is complex Fréchet differentiable at every point of ℂ, which matches the standard notion of holomorphic everywhere (entire). The injectivity assumption is captured by `Injective f`. The conclusion exactly asserts the existence of a, b ∈ ℂ with a ≠ 0 such that f(z) = a z + b for all z. This is a direct and faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. No extraneous hypotheses or weakened conclusions are introduced. The form `a * z + b` is the standard affine form; `a ≠ 0` is explicitly included. The use of `Differentiable ℂ f` matches ""entire"" in this context. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are present.

In other words, the integer n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c is not a perfect square.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language claim is: for any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive integer n such that sqrt(n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c) is not an integer. This is equivalent to the statement that the expression is not a perfect square of an integer.
- The Lean statement directly encodes “not a perfect square” as `¬∃ m : Int, m * m = ...`, which is logically equivalent to “its square root is not an integer.”
- Quantifications and domains match: a, b, c are Int; n is a positive Nat; m ranges over Int (which is standard and equivalent for squares).

3) Final check for differences:
- Allowing m in Int instead of Nat does not change the meaning for perfect squares (since m^2 ≥ 0 and squares in Int coincide with squares of Nat).
- The natural-language mention of sqrt is handled by the perfect-square condition, which is the intended formalization. Even if the expression is negative, both formulations treat it as not being a perfect square (and thus sqrt not an integer), so there is no mismatch.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is precise and faithful.

  Natural language: For natural numbers p and k with p prime, the sum over i from 0 to p−1 of (i mod p)^k in ZMod p equals −1 if (p−1) divides k, and 0 otherwise. Formally, it states
  sum_{i=0}^{p-1} (i : ZMod p)^k = if (p - 1) ∣ k then (-1 : ZMod p) else 0.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: 1^k + 2^k + ... + (p−1)^k ≡ 0 (mod p) if (p−1) ∤ k, and ≡ −1 (mod p) if (p−1) ∣ k.
- The Lean code expresses the congruence as an equality in ZMod p, which is faithful.
- Indexing mismatch: The Lean sum runs over `Finset.range p`, i.e., i = 0,1,...,p−1, thus includes the 0 term. The original sum runs from 1 to p−1, excluding 0.
- Effect of including 0:
  - For k > 0, 0^k = 0, so including 0 does not change the sum; the statements coincide.
  - For k = 0, the original sum is (p−1)·1 = p−1 ≡ −1 (mod p), matching the original statement’s case (since (p−1) | 0). The Lean sum includes the 0 term as 0^0 = 1, so the sum is p·1 = 0 in ZMod p, which disagrees with −1. The Lean statement has no restriction k > 0, so for k=0 it becomes false relative to the original statement.

3) Final check:
- Aside from the k = 0 edge case caused by including i=0, the formulations match (prime p, piecewise −1/0 outcome, modulo p via ZMod equality). The code would be faithful if either (a) the sum were over 1..p−1 (e.g., `Finset.Icc 1 (p-1)` or `(Finset.range p).erase 0`), or (b) k were assumed positive.
- Because the current Lean statement includes i=0 and allows k=0, it is not strictly faithful to the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to the inclusion of the 0 term and absence of a k > 0 assumption; otherwise it closely matches.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_1_13b {Ω : Set ℂ} (hΩ : IsOpen Ω) (hconn : IsConnected Ω) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω) {c : ℝ} (hc : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).im = c) : ∃ a : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = a := by sorry`
  This states: Let Ω be a subset of the complex numbers with Ω open (`IsOpen Ω`) and connected (`IsConnected Ω`). Let f : ℂ → ℂ be complex-differentiable on Ω (`DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω`, i.e., holomorphic on Ω). Suppose there exists a real number c such that for all z in Ω, the imaginary part of f(z) equals c. Then there exists a complex number a such that for all z in Ω, f(z) = a (i.e., f is constant on Ω).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: “Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set Ω. Prove that if Im(f) is constant, then f is constant.”
- The Lean code adds the hypothesis `IsConnected Ω`. It also makes explicit the constant value c of the imaginary part, which is equivalent to saying Im(f) is constant.
- Conclusion: f is constant on Ω, expressed as ∃ a, ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = a.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Main difference: The Lean code requires Ω to be connected, while the natural language statement mentions only that Ω is open. Without connectedness, the correct conclusion is that f is constant on each connected component, not necessarily globally constant on Ω. So the Lean code is a specialization with a standard, stronger hypothesis ensuring a global constant.
- All other aspects—holomorphicity on Ω, Im(f) is constant, and the conclusion that f is constant—are faithfully represented using standard Mathlib notions (`DifferentiableOn ℂ`, `(f z).im`, `IsOpen`, `IsConnected`). There are no fake or vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is legitimate.

Overall: The translation is essentially correct but slightly more restrictive due to the added connectedness assumption. This is a reasonable formalization choice to make the conclusion globally constant, and aligns with common textbook phrasing when the conclusion is stated globally.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the Mathlib library.
- `theorem sin_pi_div_12_is_algebraic : IsAlgebraic Rat (Complex.ofReal (Real.sin (Real.pi / 12))) := by sorry`
  This declares the theorem: the complex number obtained by embedding the real number `sin(π/12)` into `Complex` is algebraic over `ℚ`. Here `IsAlgebraic Rat z` means that `z` is a root of some nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients, and `Complex.ofReal` embeds a real into the complex numbers.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: “Show that sin(π/12) is an algebraic number.” In standard mathematical usage, an “algebraic number” is a complex number algebraic over `ℚ`. The Lean statement exactly asserts that `Complex.ofReal (sin (π/12))` is algebraic over `ℚ`. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem’s proposition matches the intended statement with the standard formalization (treating a real as a complex algebraic number over `ℚ`).
- No generalization/specialization discrepancy.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean 4 code:
- `theorem Axler_exercise_7_9 {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℂ E] [FiniteDimensional ℂ E] (T : E →L[ℂ] E) ...`:
  This sets up a finite-dimensional complex inner-product space E (hence a finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space), and T is a bounded (continuous) linear operator on E.
- `(h_normal : ContinuousLinearMap.comp T (ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint T) = ContinuousLinearMap.comp (ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint T) T)`:
  This is the normality assumption on T: T ∘ T† = T† ∘ T, where T† is the adjoint.
- Conclusion:
  `(T = ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint T) ↔ (∀ (μ : ℂ) (v : E), v ≠ 0 → T v = μ • v → μ.im = 0)`:
  This states: T is self-adjoint (i.e., equals its adjoint) if and only if for every complex number μ and vector v ≠ 0, if v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue μ (T v = μ v), then the imaginary part of μ is zero. Equivalently, every eigenvalue of T is real.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The English statement: “Prove that a normal operator on a complex inner-product space is self-adjoint if and only if all its eigenvalues are real.”
- The Lean statement assumes T is normal and proves an equivalence between self-adjointness and all eigenvalues being real. This matches the intended meaning. The quantification over v and μ encodes “μ is an eigenvalue implies μ is real,” and using μ.im = 0 is a standard way of expressing that μ is real in ℂ.
- The code works in finite dimension ([FiniteDimensional ℂ E]), which is a natural and standard context for Axler (and for the eigenvalue-based formulation). In infinite dimensions, the correct statement would involve the spectrum, not just eigenvalues, so restricting to finite dimensions is a reasonable and faithful specialization.

3) Final check for differences:
- The main potential difference is the explicit finite-dimensional assumption in Lean versus the English statement which does not state dimension. However, in the usual linear algebra context (and especially in Axler), the result is indeed formulated in finite dimensions. Moreover, the eigenvalue formulation is most appropriate there. This is an acceptable and faithful specialization per the guidelines.
- All other components (normality hypothesis, self-adjointness as equality with adjoint, and eigenvalues being real) are faithfully captured. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement in the finite-dimensional setting.

",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] (f : X → X) (hf : Isometry f) [CompactSpace X]`
  Natural language: Let X be a metric space (with its metric), let f : X → X be a map which is an isometry (i.e., d(f x, f y) = d(x, y) for all x,y), and assume X is compact.

- `theorem isometry_on_compact_bijective : Function.Bijective f := by sorry`
  Natural language: Under these assumptions, f is bijective. (Proof omitted.)
  This matches the first requested conclusion: an isometry on a compact metric space is bijective.

- `def isometry_on_compact_homeomorph : X ≃ₜ X := by sorry`
  Natural language: There exists a homeomorphism from X to X. (Proof omitted.)
  Importantly, this statement does not mention f at all; it asserts a bare existence of some self-homeomorphism of X. In Lean, the type `X ≃ₜ X` is just “a homeomorphism X ≃ X,” with no connection to the given f.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement says: if f is an isometry and X is compact, then f is bijective and hence a homeomorphism. This means the function f itself is a homeomorphism (i.e., there is a homeomorphism whose underlying function is f).
- The first Lean theorem correctly targets “f is bijective.” Good.
- The second Lean definition should express “f is a homeomorphism,” typically by constructing a term of type `X ≃ₜ X` whose underlying function is f (e.g., something like `Homeomorph.mk` using f and f⁻¹, or a lemma converting an isometric bijection to a homeomorphism). However, the presented statement only produces an arbitrary `X ≃ₜ X` without any tie to f. This is a significant mismatch: it does not encode that f is the homeomorphism.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The second conclusion in Lean is too weak and unrelated to f; it would be trivially true (the identity homeomorphism exists) even without compactness or isometry. The intended claim is specifically that f is a homeomorphism. Therefore, the translation is not faithful overall.

Other checks:
- No suspicious/vacuous auxiliary definitions were introduced; `Isometry`, `CompactSpace`, and `X ≃ₜ X` are standard Mathlib notions. The use of `sorry` is acceptable per the instructions. The main issue is the mismatch in the second statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: standard imports and namespace opening; no mathematical content change.
- The docstring: ""In the subspace topology on ℕ induced by the inclusion into ℝ, every subset is clopen."" This clarifies the intended topology on ℕ.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_32a (s : Set ℕ) : ...` states: For any subset `s` of the natural numbers, with ℕ equipped with the topology induced by the inclusion map `coe : ℕ → Real` from the real numbers, `s` is both open and closed. Formally, it asserts `IsOpen s ∧ IsClosed s` in the induced topology `TopologicalSpace.induced coe _` on ℕ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: ""Show that every subset of ℕ is clopen."" Typically, in topology texts (e.g., Pugh), ℕ is considered with its subspace topology from ℝ, under which ℕ is discrete, so indeed every subset is both open and closed. The Lean statement explicitly specifies this standard topology (the induced/subspace topology from ℝ) and asserts exactly that every subset `s` is open and closed. This matches the intended meaning.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code explicitly fixes the topology on ℕ (induced from ℝ), which is the conventional one for this statement. The natural language did not specify the topology, but this is the standard intended context. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for auditing the translation of the statement. The mathematical content aligns: ""every subset of ℕ is clopen"" ⇔ for all `s : Set ℕ`, `IsOpen s ∧ IsClosed s` in the inherited topology. No mismatches.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `theorem Putnam_exercise_1999_b4 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ContDiff ℝ 3 f)`: Let f: ℝ → ℝ be a function that is 3-times continuously differentiable (i.e., has continuous derivatives up to order 3).
- `(h0 : ∀ x, 0 < f x)`: For all real x, f(x) > 0.
- `(h1 : ∀ x, 0 < deriv f x)`: For all real x, f′(x) > 0. Here `deriv f x` denotes the first derivative of f at x.
- `(h2 : ∀ x, 0 < deriv (deriv f) x)`: For all real x, f″(x) > 0. Here `deriv (deriv f) x` denotes the second derivative at x.
- `(h3 : ∀ x, 0 < deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x)`: For all real x, f‴(x) > 0. Here `deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x` denotes the third derivative at x.
- `(hineq : ∀ x, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≤ f x)`: For all real x, f‴(x) ≤ f(x).
- Conclusion: `∀ x, deriv f x < 2 * f x`: For all real x, f′(x) < 2 f(x).

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement assumes f has a continuous third derivative; `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` precisely captures that f has continuous derivatives up to third order (slightly stronger but standard and appropriate in Mathlib, and certainly implies the intended assumption).
- The positivity assumptions for f, f′, f″, f‴ match exactly with `0 < ...` for all x.
- The inequality f‴(x) ≤ f(x) is stated verbatim.
- The desired conclusion f′(x) < 2 f(x) for all x is exactly the theorem’s conclusion.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (`ContDiff`, `deriv`) are standard Mathlib concepts. The theorem is a direct formalization of the problem statement.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement is a faithful formalization. The only slight strengthening is using `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` which ensures continuity of all derivatives up to order 3, which is consistent with having a continuous third derivative and is acceptable. There are no extraneous or missing hypotheses. The conclusion matches exactly.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: If G is a finite group, then for any a in G, there exists a positive integer n such that a^n = e. The Lean code assumes G is a finite group via `[Group G] [Fintype G]`, takes an arbitrary `a : G`, and asserts existence of `n : ℕ` with `0 < n` and `a ^ n = 1`. In Lean, `1` is the group identity (corresponding to `e`), and `^` denotes natural-number exponentiation. Thus, the Lean statement matches the natural language statement exactly.

3) Final check and differences:
- Identity element: natural language uses `e`; Lean uses `1`. These are equivalent in Lean's group notation.
- Positive integer: Lean uses `n : ℕ` with `0 < n`, matching “positive integer”.
- Assumptions (finite group): Lean uses `[Group G] [Fintype G]`, exactly the intended hypothesis. No extra assumptions (e.g., commutativity) are added.
- Dependency on `a`: The theorem is stated for an arbitrary `a : G`, as required.
There are no discrepancies. The presence of `sorry` is about the proof and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes a metric space, compactness, nonemptiness, and disjointness of the sets, and concludes the existence of such a minimizing pair.

3) Final check of differences:
- The ambient space M vs α: same role.
- Compact, disjoint, nonempty: identical hypotheses.
- Existence of a0 ∈ A and b0 ∈ B with the global minimal distance property: identical conclusion.

  Natural language translation: For any type G equipped with a group structure and which is finite, if the number of elements (the cardinality) of G is 9, then for all elements a and b in G, the product a * b equals b * a. In other words, every pair of elements commute; hence G is abelian.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The original statement is: ""Prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian."" The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: if a group G is finite with |G| = 9, then it is abelian (expressed as ∀ a b, a * b = b * a). This is a standard formalization. There are no extra or missing hypotheses. Using `Fintype.card G = 9` captures “order 9.” Expressing abelianity as pairwise commutativity is correct.

Step 3: Final check; compare the two statements.
They are the same mathematically. No auxiliary definitions are introduced, no vacuous placeholders are used. The presence of `sorry` omits the proof but does not affect the faithfulness of the statement. Everything matches.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem pugh_exercise_2_26 {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α] (U : Set α) :` sets up a theorem in an arbitrary topological space α, with U a subset of α.
- `IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x, x ∈ U → x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)` states: U is open if and only if for every point x, if x is in U then x is not in the closure of the complement of U.

Assessment with respect to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: “A set U ⊂ M is open iff none of its points are limits of its complement.” In a topological space, for a point x not in a set A, being in the closure of A is equivalent to being a limit (accumulation) point of A, since every neighborhood of x intersects A (and A \ {x} = A). Here we only quantify over x ∈ U, so x ∉ Uᶜ; thus “x is a limit of Uᶜ” is equivalent to “x ∈ closure(Uᶜ).” Therefore, “none of its points are limits of its complement” translates to “∀ x ∈ U, x ∉ closure(Uᶜ).”
- The equivalence with IsOpen U is a standard characterization: U is open iff U ∩ closure(Uᶜ) = ∅, i.e., iff every point of U is not adherent to (hence not a limit point of) the complement.

Final check:
- The Lean statement exactly captures the natural language statement in a general topological space, with no vacuous or auxiliary definitions. The slight wording difference (“limits of its complement” vs “closure of the complement”) is reconciled by the fact that we only consider points x ∈ U, making the two notions equivalent.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MeasureTheory Set`: Brings in Mathlib and opens namespaces for measure theory and sets; no mathematical content change.
- Theorem statement: `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_2_2 : ∫ x in Ioi (0 : ℝ), Real.sin x / x ∂volume = Real.pi / 2`.
  This reads: The Lebesgue integral of the function x ↦ sin x / x over the set (0, ∞) with respect to the Lebesgue measure (denoted `volume`) equals π/2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is: Show that ∫_0^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2.
- The Lean statement uses the Lebesgue integral over (0, ∞). This matches the standard interpretation of the improper integral from 0 to ∞ in measure-theoretic terms. The use of `(0, ∞)` rather than `[0, ∞)` avoids the need to define the integrand at 0 (where it is undefined), and since a single point has measure zero, the value coincides with the improper integral when it exists. Thus, the formal statement is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check:
- Domain: (0, ∞) vs [0, ∞). The difference is the single point 0; in Lebesgue integration this does not affect the value, and the improper integral is indeed interpreted as the Lebesgue integral over (0, ∞) when the limit exists.
- Integrand: Real.sin x / x matches sin x / x.
- Measure: `∂volume` is the Lebesgue measure, matching the usual dx.
- Conclusion: equals π/2.
There are no auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions; the theorem statement is exactly the desired result. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_52 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] [DecidableEq G] (φ : G ≃* G)` introduces a finite group `G` (via `[Group G]` and `[Fintype G]`), with decidable equality (a harmless technical assumption), and an automorphism `φ` of `G` (a group isomorphism `G ≃* G`).
- The hypothesis `(h : 4 * Fintype.card ({x : G // φ x = x⁻¹}) > 3 * Fintype.card G)` states that the number of elements `x` of `G` with `φ x = x⁻¹` is greater than three-fourths of the total number of elements of `G`. This is exactly the formalization of “for more than three-fourths of the elements of G”.
- The conclusion `: (∀ y : G, φ y = y⁻¹) ∧ (∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a)` asserts (i) `φ(y) = y⁻¹` for all `y ∈ G`, and (ii) `G` is abelian (since `∀ a b, a * b = b * a`).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The objects and hypotheses match: finite group, automorphism, and the “more than three-fourths” condition is expressed strictly with `>`, matching “more than”.
- The conclusions match: `φ(y) = y⁻¹` for all `y`, and `G` is abelian. Using the commuting law for all elements is a standard formalization of “abelian”.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts use Mathlib primitives (`Group`, `Fintype`, `G ≃* G`, `Fintype.card`).
- The extra `[DecidableEq G]` is a benign technical assumption and does not alter the mathematical content.

Final check:
- The formal statement is essentially identical to the original natural language theorem. No scope narrowing or unintended generalization is present. The inequality direction and quantifiers are correct. Hence, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {V : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup V] [InnerProductSpace ℂ V] [FiniteDimensional ℂ V] [CompleteSpace V]`:

  The theorem states: If there exist two nonzero vectors v, w in V that are orthogonal (⟪v, w⟫ = 0), then it is not the case that the sum of any two normal operators is normal. In other words, the set of normal operators is not closed under addition, hence it is not a subspace of the space of continuous linear operators V →L[ℂ] V. The comment notes that having two nonzero orthogonal vectors holds in particular if dim V ≥ 2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If dim V ≥ 2, then the set of normal operators on V is not a subspace of L(V).
- The code proves a slightly more structured version: If V has two nonzero orthogonal vectors, then normal operators are not closed under addition, hence not a subspace. In a finite-dimensional complex inner product space, dim V ≥ 2 implies the existence of two nonzero orthogonal vectors (by Gram–Schmidt), and conversely the existence of two nonzero orthogonal vectors implies dim V ≥ 2. So within this context, the hypothesis used in the code is equivalent to dim V ≥ 2.
- The conclusion in the code is the negation of additivity for normal operators, which indeed implies the set is not a subspace. So the mathematical content matches the natural language claim.
- Technical formalization: The code uses continuous linear maps V →L[ℂ] V, which in finite dimensions coincide with all linear maps L(V). The definition of normality via adjoint is standard. No vacuous placeholders are used; the definition of is_normal is genuine, and the theorem states a real mathematical claim (proof omitted by sorry, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Differences:
  - The hypothesis is phrased as the existence of two nonzero orthogonal vectors instead of dim V ≥ 2. In this finite-dimensional complex inner product context, these are equivalent, so the difference is benign.
  - The conclusion is stated as “not closed under addition” rather than “not a subspace,” but the former directly implies the latter, so this faithfully captures the intended statement.
  - The code specializes to complex inner product spaces and continuous linear maps; this is the standard setting for normal operators and is consistent with Axler's context.
  - An extra assumption `[CompleteSpace V]` is included but is harmless in finite dimension.
- No red flags: no vacuous definitions; use of Mathlib structures is legitimate; the formalization aligns with the intended meaning.

Overall, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, up to standard and acceptable formalization choices and an equivalent hypothesis.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Real`/`open Set`: just imports and namespace openings; no mathematical content changes.
- Comment: ""/-- The series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k (log k)^p) converges for p > 1. We index from n to avoid log 1. -/"" clarifies the intended statement and the indexing shift to avoid the undefined/divergent issue at k=1 where log 1 = 0.
- Theorem statement: `theorem pugh_exercise_3_63a {p : ℝ} (hp : 1 < p) : Summable (fun n : ℕ => 1 / ((n + 2) * (log (n + 2)) ^ p)) := by sorry`
  This asserts: For real p with p > 1, the real series with terms a_n = 1 / ((n+2) * (log(n+2))^p) is summable. Since n runs over ℕ starting at 0, this is exactly the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k (log k)^p) via the change of variables k = n + 2. The power `^ p` here denotes real exponentiation on ℝ (Real.rpow), and since n+2 ≥ 2, log(n+2) > 0, the expression is well-defined and positive.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""Prove that ∑ 1/(k (log k)^p) converges when p > 1."" The standard convention is the sum from k = 2 to ∞ (to avoid log 1 = 0). The Lean statement uses an index shift n ↦ n+2, which is equivalent. It requires p > 1, exactly as in the statement, and asserts summability (convergence of the series) over ℕ into ℝ.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Indexing: Lean uses n+2, which corresponds exactly to starting at k=2. This matches the intended meaning.
- Base of logarithm: Lean uses natural log; any base would only introduce a constant factor, so convergence is unaffected. This is acceptable.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with `sorry` proof placeholder, which is allowed per the task instructions.
- The interpretation of the denominator as k*(log k)^p matches the usual reading of the natural language expression.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (with the standard and appropriate index shift to start at k=2).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: Fix an arbitrary group G.

- `variable (h : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n)`: Assume that for all a, b in G, (ab)^n = a^n b^n, where exponentiation is with the integer exponent n.
- The theorem:
  `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_2_6c (a b : G) : (a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1 := by sorry`
  This states: For all a, b in G, we have (a b a^{-1} b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = 1 (the group identity). Here 1 is Lean's notation for the identity element e, and the exponent n(n-1) is an integer product; with hn : 1 < n it is positive.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The code fixes a group G, an integer n > 1, and the hypothesis that (ab)^n = a^n b^n for all a, b in G. This matches the natural language assumption “for some fixed integer n > 1 for all a, b ∈ G, (ab)^n = a^n b^n”.
- The conclusion in Lean is exactly “for all a, b ∈ G, (a b a^{-1} b^{-1})^{n(n−1)} = 1”, matching the natural language conclusion with 1 in place of e (standard in mathlib).
- Using Int for n is faithful to “integer n > 1”; the inequality 1 < n ensures n is positive. The exponentiation by Int is standard in mathlib and consistent with the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Notational difference e vs 1: harmless, both denote the identity element in group notation.
- Type of n: Int in Lean vs “integer” in text is faithful. The assumption 1 < n matches n > 1.
- All quantifiers align: the hypothesis is universal in a, b, and the conclusion is universal in a, b.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; the theorem is stated with meaningful hypotheses.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""If σ, τ are two permutations that disturb no common element and σ τ = e, prove that σ = τ = e."" Translating:
  - ""disturb no common element"" means no element is moved by both σ and τ, i.e., the supports are disjoint. In Mathlib, support is the finite set of elements not fixed by the permutation, so (σ.support ∩ τ.support) = ∅ matches this.
  - ""σ τ = e"" corresponds to σ * τ = 1 in the group structure on permutations.
  - Conclusion ""σ = τ = e"" is equivalent to σ = 1 ∧ τ = 1.
Thus, the Lean statement matches the mathematical content.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The Lean code adds assumptions [DecidableEq α] [Fintype α]. These are technical requirements to use Perm α and especially Finset-based support. The natural language statement does not explicitly restrict to finite sets, but this is a standard formalization choice in Mathlib for support as a Finset. This is a slight specialization that does not change the essence of the statement and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem statement itself captures exactly the intended meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (with a benign finiteness assumption for using Finset support).

This is the standard local power-series representation, i.e., analyticity around z0, plus the additional condition that at least one coefficient is zero.
- Conclusion: `∃ N : ℕ, ∃ a : ℕ → Complex, (∀ n, n > N → a n = 0) ∧ ∀ z : Complex, f z = ∑' n, a n * z ^ n` asserts that there exist coefficients a_n and an integer N such that all coefficients beyond N vanish and f(z) = ∑ a_n z^n for all z. Since only finitely many a_n are nonzero, this says exactly that f is a polynomial in z.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: f is analytic everywhere on C, and for each z0 the Taylor expansion of f about z0 has at least one zero coefficient. Conclude f is a polynomial.
- The code’s hypothesis `h` matches the analyticity condition: for each z0, f agrees with a power series in a neighborhood of z0. Since the power series representation of an analytic function in a neighborhood is unique, the c in the code are precisely the Taylor coefficients (no need to state it explicitly). The extra condition `∃ n0, c n0 = 0` says “at least one coefficient is zero.”
- The conclusion matches “f is a polynomial” via a global finite power series expansion about 0. This is a standard formalization of being a polynomial function.

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are from Mathlib. The code doesn’t weaken the hypothesis; it captures analyticity at each point with a local series representation and the zero-coefficient property. The conclusion exactly matches the claim that f is a polynomial.
- Minor technical note: the use of `tsum` is standard and acceptable; equality to a `tsum` on a disk is the conventional way to state local power series representation. The presence of r > 0 and the uniform equality on the disk aligns with analyticity.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

  - `h1 : (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n`
  - `h2 : (a * b) ^ (n + 1) = a ^ (n + 1) * b ^ (n + 1)`
  - `h3 : (a * b) ^ (n + 2) = a ^ (n + 2) * b ^ (n + 2)`
  These assert that for this particular pair (a,b), the equality (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for three consecutive integers i = n, n+1, n+2.
- Conclusion: `a * b = b * a`. So, under those three equalities for this specific pair, a and b commute.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: If G is a group in which (ab)^i = a^i b^i for three consecutive integers i, prove that G is abelian. This is typically interpreted as: there exists a fixed triple of consecutive integers i, i+1, i+2 such that for all a, b in G, (ab)^k = a^k b^k holds for k in that triple; conclude that for all a, b, a*b = b*a (i.e., G is abelian).

The Lean theorem is a local lemma: it fixes a particular pair a, b and a particular integer n, assumes the three equalities for that pair only, and concludes that that pair commutes. It does not quantify the hypotheses over all pairs nor does it package the conclusion as “G is abelian” (i.e., ∀ a b, a*b = b*a or an appropriate commutativity structure), nor does it enforce that the same n works for all pairs.

3) Final comparison:
- Hypotheses: Natural statement demands the property holds group-wide (for all a, b) for a single triple of consecutive integers. The Lean code only assumes it for one fixed pair (a, b), and allows n to be chosen per application; it does not encode the uniformity across all pairs.
- Conclusion: Natural statement concludes “G is abelian” (a global, universally quantified statement). The Lean code concludes only that the specific a and b commute.

Thus, while the Lean theorem is a useful lemma that would be used to derive the natural statement when combined with a global hypothesis (apply it to arbitrary a, b with the uniform triple), it is not itself a faithful translation of the original global claim. There are no vacuous definitions; the use of Int for exponents matches the “integers” phrasing. The only issue is missing global quantification and the abelian group conclusion.

Given this, the code is very close but not a faithful translation of the exact statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Polynomial`: Opens the Polynomial namespace to use polynomial notation like `X` and operations conveniently.
- The theorem `irreducible_x_cubed_plus_three_x_plus_two : Irreducible (X ^ 3 + 3 * X + 2 : ℚ[X])` states precisely that the polynomial x^3 + 3x + 2 over the rationals is irreducible in Q[x]. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear and non-vacuous.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement asks to prove that f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2 is irreducible in Q[x]. The Lean statement asserts `Irreducible (X ^ 3 + 3 * X + 2 : ℚ[X])`. This is exactly the same mathematical claim, with no extra hypotheses or changes.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same: irreducibility of x^3 + 3x + 2 in ℚ[X]. No auxiliary definitions, no vacuous placeholders, correct use of Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` affects only the proof, not the translation of the statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_7_7 {G : Type _} {G' : Type _} [Group G] [Group G']`: We are working with two types G and G' equipped with group structures.
- `(φ : G →* G')`: φ is a group homomorphism from G to G'.
- `(hφ : Function.Surjective φ)`: φ is surjective (onto).
- `(N : Subgroup G)`: N is a subgroup of G.
- `(hN : ∀ g n, n ∈ N → g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N)`: For all g, n in G, if n ∈ N then g n g⁻¹ ∈ N. This is the standard conjugation-invariance characterization of N being normal in G.
- Conclusion: `∀ g' : G', ∀ n' : G', n' ∈ Subgroup.map φ N → g' * n' * g'⁻¹ ∈ Subgroup.map φ N`: For every g' in G' and every n' in the image subgroup φ(N) (written as `Subgroup.map φ N`), the conjugate g' n' g'⁻¹ is again in φ(N). This is the standard conjugation-invariance characterization of φ(N) being normal in G'.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If φ is a homomorphism of G onto G' and N ◁ G, then φ(N) ◁ G'.
- Lean: Assumes φ is a group homomorphism and surjective; assumes N is normal via the conjugation-invariance property; concludes φ(N) is normal via the conjugation-invariance property in G'. This directly matches the intended statement, with `Subgroup.map φ N` representing φ(N).

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues.
- The Lean code uses the explicit characterization of normality (closure under conjugation) rather than the bundled predicate `Subgroup.Normal`. This is mathematically equivalent and faithful.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the assumptions are meaningful and standard.
- The conclusion exactly states normality of the image subgroup under conjugation in G'.
- Surjectivity is included as required by “onto”.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_3_16 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Nontrivial G]`: Let G be a nontrivial group.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ H : Subgroup G, H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤`: Every subgroup H of G is either the trivial subgroup (⊥) or the whole group (⊤). Equivalently, G has no nontrivial proper subgroups; the only subgroups are {e} and G.
- Conclusion: `∃ (p : ℕ) (fg : Fintype G), Nat.Prime p ∧ IsCyclic G ∧ @Fintype.card G fg = p`: There exists a natural number p and a proof that G is finite (a `Fintype` instance) such that p is prime, G is cyclic, and the cardinality of G is p. In other words, G is cyclic of (finite) order p, with p prime.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""If a group G has no proper subgroups, prove that G is cyclic of order p, where p is a prime number.""
- The Lean hypothesis `∀ H, H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤` exactly formalizes the standard intended meaning: the only subgroups are {e} and G itself (i.e., no nontrivial proper subgroups). The added `[Nontrivial G]` assumption excludes the trivial group, which is necessary because the conclusion (order p with p prime) would be false for the trivial group. This is the conventional formulation of this exercise.
- The conclusion matches precisely: cyclic and of order p with p prime. The inclusion of an existential `Fintype G` is a technical device to express finiteness and the order; it aligns with “order p” in natural language.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only potential discrepancy is the explicit `[Nontrivial G]` assumption, which is standard and necessary to make the statement true and matches the usual intended meaning of the exercise. It is a harmless specialization and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib concepts. The theorem has a `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for auditing translation faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This states: Let F and K be fields with an F-algebra structure on K (so we can view F as a subfield of K via the algebra map). For an element a in K, if a^2 is algebraic over F, then a is algebraic over F. The proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: ""If a ∈ K is such that a^2 is algebraic over the subfield F of K, show that a is algebraic over F."" The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: F, K are fields, K is an F-algebra (capturing the subfield relationship via the injective algebra map), `a : K`, hypothesis `IsAlgebraic F (a ^ 2)`, conclusion `IsAlgebraic F a`.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not introduce any auxiliary or vacuous definitions; it uses the standard Mathlib predicate `IsAlgebraic`. The use of `[Algebra F K]` correctly models ""F is a subfield of K"" in this context. No extra assumptions or restrictions are added. The statement is neither a weakening nor a strengthening; it is exactly the same claim.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_23 (G : Type*) [Group G] ...` sets up an arbitrary type `G` equipped with a group structure.
- Hypothesis `hnormal : ∀ H : Subgroup G, ∀ g : G, Set.image (fun h => g * h * g⁻¹) (H : Set G) = (H : Set G)` says: for every subgroup `H` of `G` and every element `g ∈ G`, the conjugation map `h ↦ g h g⁻¹` sends `H` (as a set) onto itself. This is exactly the condition that every subgroup of `G` is normal (the image equals the subgroup for each conjugation).
- `(a b : G) : ∃ j : Int, b * a = a ^ j * b` states: for any `a, b ∈ G`, there exists an integer `j` such that `ba = a^j b`. Here `a ^ j` uses integer exponentiation in a group (zpow), appropriate for the statement.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but for the purpose of auditing the translation, only the statement matters.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumption “all subgroups of G are normal in G” is formalized as: for every subgroup `H` and every `g ∈ G`, conjugation by `g` maps `H` onto itself. This is equivalent to normality and thus faithful.
- The conclusion “If a, b ∈ G, prove that ba = a^j b for some j” is exactly the existential statement with `j : Int` in Lean: `∃ j : Int, b * a = a ^ j * b`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification and type of `j`: The natural language says “some j,” typically understood as an integer since powers in groups may be negative; the Lean code explicitly uses `Int`, which matches standard mathematical intent.
- The hypothesis is given in terms of set equality under the conjugation map, which is fully equivalent to the definition of normality for subgroups. No extra or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a direct theorem statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem ring_hom_field_injective {K L : Type*} [Field K] [Field L] (f : K →+* L) : Function.Injective f := by sorry`
  This states: For any types K and L equipped with Field structures, and any ring homomorphism f from K to L (in Lean, `K →+* L` denotes a unital ring homomorphism), f is injective. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is: ""Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.""
- In Lean, a ""homomorphism of fields"" is formalized as a unital ring homomorphism (`RingHom`) between fields, which is the standard mathematical notion of a field homomorphism (preserves +, *, and 1). The conclusion `Function.Injective f` matches ""is injective.""
- Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a direct and faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check and potential nuances:
- Some textbooks use a weaker notion of homomorphism (not necessarily sending 1 to 1); under that weaker notion the zero map exists and the statement would be false. Lean uses the standard unital notion (`RingHom`), which aligns with the usual definition under which the statement is true. This is the intended interpretation of ""homomorphism of fields"" and hence faithful.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement is clean and standard.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_2_3_2 {G : Type _} [Group G] (a b : G) : ∃ g : G, g * (a * b) * g⁻¹ = b * a := by sorry`
  - This declares a theorem for any type `G` equipped with a group structure `[Group G]` and elements `a b : G`.
  - The conclusion is: there exists an element `g : G` such that `g * (a * b) * g⁻¹ = b * a`.
  - In words, it asserts that `ba` is a conjugate of `ab` via some `g`. This is the standard definition of conjugacy: elements `x` and `y` are conjugate if there exists `g` with `g x g⁻¹ = y`.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that the products ab and ba are conjugate elements in a group.""
- The Lean statement exactly formalizes this by asserting the existence of `g` such that conjugating `ab` by `g` yields `ba`.
- No extra hypotheses are added; it holds in any group. No missing conditions.
- The direction chosen (g*(ab)*g⁻¹ = ba) is equivalent to the symmetric phrasing ""ab and ba are conjugate"".

Final check:
- The math problems are the same. The Lean theorem is a precise formalization of the claim that `ab` and `ba` are conjugate in a group.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement with a placeholder proof. The task asks about translation, not proof.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- (hnot : b ∉ A): b is not in A.
- Conclusion: (A : Set G) ∩ Subgroup.closure (Set.singleton b) = Set.singleton (1 : G): the intersection (as sets) of A with the subgroup generated by b equals the singleton {1}, i.e., the trivial subgroup.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let A be a normal subgroup of G, b ∈ G of prime order p with b ∉ A. Show A ∩ (b) = (e), where (b) denotes the cyclic subgroup generated by b and (e) the identity subgroup {e}.
- Lean hypotheses match exactly: A is normal (hN), b has prime order p (hp and horder), and b ∉ A (hnot).
- Lean conclusion matches: A ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {1}. Subgroup.closure {b} is the cyclic subgroup generated by b. Set.singleton (1) corresponds to the trivial subgroup. Equality is stated as sets, which is equivalent to the subgroup equality in this context.

Checks for red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- No auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement with assumptions corresponding to the natural language statement.
- Using set intersection instead of subgroup intersection is a harmless formal choice; it is mathematically equivalent here.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the given natural language statement without weakening or strengthening it in any problematic way (if anything, the normality is included exactly as needed).

  This says: a function mu (defined on all reals, but only its behavior on (0,∞) matters) is a modulus of continuity if (i) it is strictly increasing on (0,∞), (ii) it is continuous on (0,∞), (iii) mu(s) → 0 as s → 0+ (epsilon-delta form), and (iv) mu(s) > 0 for all s > 0.

  This encodes: f has modulus mu on [a,b] (with the side condition a ≤ b) if for all s,t in the closed interval [a,b], we have |f(s) − f(t)| ≤ mu(|s − t|).

- `theorem uniform_on_Icc_iff_has_modulus ... : UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b) ↔ ∃ mu, modulus_of_continuity mu ∧ has_modulus_on_interval f mu a b := by sorry`
  This asserts: For a function f and a<b, f is uniformly continuous on [a,b] if and only if there exists a modulus of continuity mu such that f has mu as a modulus on [a,b]. The proof is omitted, but the statement is the key for translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines a modulus of continuity as a continuous, strictly increasing function mu: (0,∞)→(0,∞) with mu(s)→0 as s→0. The Lean definition matches this exactly: strict monotonicity and continuity on (0,∞), the limit to 0 at 0+, and positivity for s>0 (reflecting the codomain (0,∞)). The Lean mu is typed as ℝ→ℝ but constrained on (0,∞); this is a standard and faithful formalization.
- The notion “f has modulus mu on [a,b] if |f(s)−f(t)| ≤ mu(|s−t|) for all s,t∈[a,b]” is encoded verbatim in `has_modulus_on_interval`.
- The theorem “a function is uniformly continuous iff it has a modulus of continuity” on a closed bounded interval is encoded as an equivalence between `UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b)` and the existence of such a mu with the stated properties. The added hypothesis `a < b` (rather than merely a ≤ b) is a harmless strengthening; the definition itself already includes a ≤ b, so this is consistent and does not change the essence of the statement.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Domain/codomain of mu: Natural language uses mu: (0,∞)→(0,∞); Lean uses mu: ℝ→ℝ with properties only on (0,∞) and explicit positivity on (0,∞). This is a faithful modeling choice.
- Use at s=t: Lean’s inequality evaluates mu(0) when s=t, but since mu is defined on ℝ, this is fine. The natural-language version’s mu is not defined at 0, but the inequality is trivial at s=t, so this is a benign technical extension.
- Interval condition: Lean includes a ≤ b in the predicate and assumes a < b in the theorem; this does not change the equivalence in any substantive way.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all properties are standard Mathlib notions. The final theorem statement matches the natural language assertion. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- Conclusion is a statement quantified over any two types G and H equipped with group structures and Fintype instances (so finite groups). The assumptions Fintype.card G = p * q and Fintype.card H = p * q assert that G and H have order pq.

- The conclusion Nonempty (G ≃* H) asserts there exists a group isomorphism between G and H (i.e., G and H are isomorphic as groups).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: if p > q are primes with q | (p − 1), then any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic. The Lean statement matches this precisely:
- p and q primes, p > q, q | (p − 1): present as hp, hq, hpq, hd.

- ""are isomorphic"": encoded as Nonempty (G ≃* H).

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses an explicit witness of noncommutativity rather than a named predicate ""nonabelian""; these are equivalent in standard logic: a group is abelian iff ∀ x y, x*y = y*x, and nonabelian iff ∃ x y, x*y ≠ y*x.
- No extraneous or missing hypotheses. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The structure and quantification match ""any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic"" under the given number-theoretic conditions.
- The use of Fintype.card equals p*q accurately captures ""order pq"".

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that the center of the product of two groups is the product of their centers."" The Lean statement exactly asserts equality of the center of G × H with the external product of the centers, as subgroups of G × H. This matches the intended meaning in standard algebra language.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f {z : ℂ | ‖z‖ < 1}: f is holomorphic (analytic) on the open unit disc.
- hbound : ∃ M, ∀ z0, ‖z0‖ < 1 → ‖f z0‖ ≤ M: f is bounded on the unit disc.
- hf_not_zero : ¬ (∀ z0, ‖z0‖ < 1 → f z0 = 0): f is not identically zero on the unit disc.
- z : ℕ → ℂ: a sequence of complex numbers.
- hz_in : ∀ n, ‖z n‖ < 1: every z n lies in the unit disc.
- hz_zero : ∀ n, f (z n) = 0: every z n is a zero of f.
- hz_enumerates : ∀ w, ‖w‖ < 1 → f w = 0 → ∃ n, z n = w: every zero of f in the unit disc appears at least once in the sequence z (surjection onto the set of zeros).
- Conclusion: Summable (fun n => (1 : ℝ) - ‖z n‖): the series ∑_n (1 - ‖z n‖) converges.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypotheses “holomorphic on the unit disc”, “bounded”, and “not identically zero” match.
- The code intends z to be a sequence of zeros in the unit disc. However, the crucial aspect of “counting multiplicity” is not encoded. The docstring mentions counting multiplicity, but the formal hypothesis hz_enumerates only requires that each zero appears at least once; it neither enforces that zeros appear exactly according to multiplicity nor prevents extra repetitions beyond multiplicity.
- Because hz_zero and hz_enumerates together only assert set-level surjectivity onto the zeros, the sequence z may repeat a zero arbitrarily (even infinitely) many times. This can make the series ∑ (1 - ‖z n‖) diverge (e.g., infinite repetition of a single zero), so the Lean statement is stronger than intended and potentially false under its own hypotheses.
- The original statement (as standard in the Blaschke condition) requires counting multiplicity; the Lean code does not capture this and instead allows arbitrary repetitions, which is a significant mismatch.

3) Final check:
- The math problems are different. The Lean code omits the multiplicity requirement and allows unrestricted duplicates, making the conclusion not a faithful translation of the standard statement. No vacuous definitions are present, and most hypotheses align, but the multiplicity/repetition issue is substantial.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem `artin_exercise_3_7_2` is stated for a type `F` with `[Field F]` and `[Infinite F]`, and a type `V` with `[AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]`. This sets up a vector space `V` over an infinite field `F`.
- `(l : List (Submodule F V))`: We fix a finite list `l` of subspaces (submodules) of `V`.
- `(h : ∀ S ∈ l, S ≠ (⊤ : Submodule F V))`: Every subspace in the list is proper (not equal to `⊤ = V`).
- Conclusion: `∃ v : V, ∀ S ∈ l, v ∉ (S : Set V)`: There exists a vector `v` in `V` that is not in any subspace from the list. Equivalently, the union of the finitely many subspaces in `l` is strictly smaller than `V`.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; allowed per instructions as no vacuous definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: For a vector space `V` over an infinite field `F`, `V` is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces. The Lean statement, given any finite list of proper subspaces, produces a `v ∈ V` not contained in any of them, which is exactly the same as saying the union of those finitely many proper subspaces is not all of `V`. It handles arbitrary finite families via `List`, and allows duplicates (which do not affect the union). The condition of “proper subspace” is encoded as `S ≠ ⊤`. No extraneous assumptions (like finite-dimensionality) are added; `Infinite F` matches the hypothesis. Edge cases (e.g. empty list) are consistent: the union is empty, not `V`.

3) Final check:
The formal and natural statements coincide in meaning. No auxiliary, vacuous, or misleading definitions are introduced. Quantifiers align: for any finite family of proper subspaces, there exists a vector outside their union. No discrepancies found.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem one_add_isUnit_of_isNilpotent {R : Type*} [Ring R] {x : R} (hx : IsNilpotent x) : IsUnit (1 + x) := by sorry`
  This states: For any type R equipped with a Ring structure, and any element x in R, if x is nilpotent (expressed by `IsNilpotent x`), then `1 + x` is a unit (expressed by `IsUnit (1 + x)`). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable under the given auditing instructions that focus on statement faithfulness rather than proof.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""An element x of a ring R is called nilpotent if some power of x is zero. Prove that if x is nilpotent, then 1+x is a unit in R."" The Lean code uses Mathlib's `IsNilpotent x` to capture ""some power of x is zero"" and `IsUnit (1 + x)` to capture ""1+x is a unit"". It quantifies over an arbitrary ring `R` (with 1) via `[Ring R]`, which aligns with the usual context of the statement and does not introduce extra assumptions (e.g., no commutativity required). Thus, the formal statement is exactly the intended one.

Checks for issues:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib predicates are used (`IsNilpotent`, `IsUnit`).
- The presence of `sorry` is in the proof, not in definitions; the task only requires checking statement faithfulness, not providing a proof.
- No mismatches or generalization beyond the intended statement.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

  Natural language: For any finite group G and any primes p and q, G is not simple.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language claim requires the hypothesis |G| = p * q. The Lean theorem does not include any hypothesis about the cardinality of G. It only assumes G is a finite group and p, q are primes, and concludes G is not simple. This is a much stronger and incorrect statement, and it does not match the original.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only a single theorem with an unproven proof (`sorry`). The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for auditing the statement, but the statement itself is missing the crucial assumption relating |G| and p*q.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: If |G| = p q with p, q prime, then G is not simple.
- Lean: For any finite group G and primes p, q, G is not simple.
- Difference: The Lean statement omits the cardinality condition |G| = p*q, yielding an entirely different and false claim. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  This states: Let G be a finite abelian group, and let p, n, m be natural numbers. Let H be a subgroup of G (also finite). Assume p is prime, p does not divide m, |G| = p^n * m, and |H| = p^n. Then for every automorphism φ of G (a multiplicative equivalence `G ≃* G`), the image of H under φ, expressed as `H.map φ.toMonoidHom`, equals H. In other words, φ(H) = H for every automorphism φ.
  The use of `CommGroup` matches “abelian group”. `Fintype.card` matches the group order condition. `hp : Nat.Prime p` and `hm : ¬ p ∣ m` encode that p is a prime and p does not divide m. `H.map φ.toMonoidHom = H` formalizes that H is fixed by every automorphism, i.e., H is characteristic.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: G abelian of order p^n m with p ∤ m, and H ≤ G has order p^n; conclude H is characteristic. The theorem’s hypotheses and conclusion align exactly: abelian group, finite order p^n * m, subgroup H of order p^n, p prime and p ∤ m, and the conclusion is invariance under every automorphism, i.e., characteristic.
- Using `G ≃* G` to represent automorphisms and `H.map φ.toMonoidHom = H` to express invariance is standard and faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard mathlib notions. The result is stated directly in terms of automorphism invariance, which is equivalent to being characteristic. The abelian assumption matches the natural language statement. Additional `[Fintype H]` is harmless and derivable.
- No extraneous generalization or specialization beyond the natural statement.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Finset` are standard imports; `open Finset` is unused here.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem Herstein_exercise_5_1_8 {F : Type*} [Field F] (p : ℕ) [Fact (CharP F p)] (n : ℕ) (a b : F) :
    (a + b) ^ p ^ n = a ^ p ^ n + b ^ p ^ n := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type F equipped with a field structure, any natural number p with the property that F has characteristic p (encoded as `CharP F p`), any natural number n, and any elements a, b in F, we have the equality `(a + b)^(p^n) = a^(p^n) + b^(p^n)`. The expression `x ^ p ^ n` in Lean parses as `x ^ (p ^ n)` due to right-associativity of `^` with Nat exponents, so this matches m = p^n. The use of `[Fact (CharP F p)]` means we assume the proposition `CharP F p` holds; it’s a legitimate way to state the characteristic assumption, though usually one writes `[CharP F p]` directly.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If F is a field of characteristic p ≠ 0, show that for all a, b in F and any positive integer n, with m = p^n, we have (a + b)^m = a^m + b^m.
- The code correctly targets the Frobenius power identity with exponent m = p^n and quantifies over all a, b, n.
- However, it omits the crucial assumption p ≠ 0. In Lean, `p : ℕ` together with `[Fact (CharP F p)]` allows p = 0 (characteristic zero). The statement is false in characteristic zero for n ≥ 1, since it would assert `(a+b)^0 = a^0 + b^0`, i.e., `1 = 1 + 1`, which is false in general. Thus, the theorem statement is strictly stronger than the natural language statement and includes an incorrect case.
- The natural statement requires n to be a positive integer. The code allows any `n : ℕ` (including n = 0). Allowing n = 0 is a benign generalization if p ≠ 0, because the identity still holds when m = p^0 = 1. So the lack of `0 < n` is acceptable as a slight generalization. The main issue remains the missing `p ≠ 0`.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code’s theorem asserts the identity for all characteristics `p` including `p = 0`, whereas the natural language statement explicitly restricts to `p ≠ 0`. This is a substantive discrepancy that makes the Lean statement unfaithful to the original. Everything else (field, the exact equality with exponent m = p^n, universal quantification over a, b, and n) matches or is a harmless generalization. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the only issue is the missing assumption `p ≠ 0` (and, less critically, not requiring `n > 0`).

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- `variable {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α]`: We work in an arbitrary topological space α.
- `theorem pugh_exercise_2_92 (K : ℕ → Set α)`: Consider a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of subsets K n of α.
- Hypotheses:
  - `(h_comp : ∀ n, IsCompact (K n))`: Each K n is compact.
  - `(h_ne : ∀ n, (K n).Nonempty)`: Each K n is nonempty.
  - `(h_mono : ∀ n, K (n+1) ⊆ K n)`: The sequence is nested decreasing (each next set is contained in the previous).
- Conclusion:
  - `({ x | ∀ n, x ∈ K n }).Nonempty`: The intersection over all n of K n is nonempty.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: ""Give a direct proof that the nested decreasing intersection of nonempty covering compact sets is nonempty."" The Lean theorem asserts exactly that for a nested decreasing sequence of nonempty compact sets in a topological space, the intersection is nonempty. The code captures the standard hypotheses (compactness, nonemptiness, monotone decreasing) and concludes the intersection is nonempty.

3) Final comparison and any discrepancies:
- The only potentially ambiguous word in the natural language is ""covering"" in ""nonempty covering compact sets."" The formalization does not include any additional ""covering"" condition (e.g., that the sets cover some space). Given the standard theorem and phrasing in topology, this word appears superfluous or a misstatement; the essence of the claim is about nested decreasing nonempty compact sets. Aside from this likely extraneous word, the formal statement matches the intended mathematical content.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; all assumptions are meaningful Mathlib predicates. The statement is a standard, faithful formalization.

Therefore, the translation is faithful. The minor wording discrepancy about ""covering"" prevents an absolutely perfect match, so I assign a 9.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- The comment restates the natural language problem: If P is normal in G and is a p-Sylow subgroup, then for every automorphism φ of G, φ(P) = P.
- `theorem automorphism_sylow_eq_self {G : Type*} [Group G] {p : ℕ} (P : Subgroup G) (hP_normal : Subgroup.Normal P) (hP_sylow : True) : ∀ φ : G ≃* G, Subgroup.map (MulEquiv.toMonoidHom φ) P = P := by sorry`
  - This declares: For any group `G`, natural number `p`, subgroup `P : Subgroup G`, assuming `P` is normal (`Subgroup.Normal P`) and assuming `hP_sylow : True` (intended to stand for “P is a p-Sylow subgroup,” but actually just a vacuous hypothesis), then for every automorphism `φ : G ≃* G`, `Subgroup.map (MulEquiv.toMonoidHom φ) P = P`.
  - `G ≃* G` denotes a group automorphism of `G`.
  - `Subgroup.map (MulEquiv.toMonoidHom φ) P` is the image subgroup φ(P), i.e., `{φ(x) | x ∈ P}`. So the conclusion `= P` is exactly φ(P) = P.
Assessment of faithfulness:
- The normality assumption is correctly represented: `hP_normal : Subgroup.Normal P` matches `P ◁ G`.
- The “p-Sylow” assumption is not represented faithfully: `hP_sylow : True` is a vacuous placeholder, not Mathlib’s `IsSylow P p` (or an equivalent formulation involving `Sylow p G`). This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- Missing standard assumptions for Sylow theory: The code does not assume that `G` is finite (e.g., `[Fintype G]`) nor that `p` is prime; both are implicit in the notion of a p-Sylow subgroup. This is a significant mismatch.
- The representation of φ(P) as `Subgroup.map (MulEquiv.toMonoidHom φ) P` is correct.
- The theorem itself is stated with a `by sorry`, but proofs are allowed to be omitted; the issue is not the proof but the vacuous and missing assumptions.
Final comparison:
- The core conclusion “for every automorphism φ, φ(P) = P” is correctly mirrored by the equality of subgroups.
- However, the crucial hypothesis “P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G” is replaced by `True`, and finiteness/primeness assumptions are absent. Thus the translation is not faithful.
- If `hP_sylow` were replaced by a legitimate `IsSylow P p` (or appropriate Mathlib equivalent) and appropriate finiteness/prime assumptions were added, the formal statement would match the natural language. As it stands, it fails due to a vacuous placeholder and missing conditions.

- `noncomputable def herstein_exercise_4_1_34 : MulEquiv (Units (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) (ZMod 2))) (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)) := by sorry`
  This declares (without proof) a multiplicative equivalence (i.e., a group isomorphism) between:
  • `Units (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) (ZMod 2))`: the group of units (invertible elements) in the ring of 2×2 matrices over ZMod 2 (i.e., GL₂(Z/2Z)), and
  • `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`: the group of permutations on a 3-element set, i.e., S₃.
  The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines T as the group of 2×2 matrices over the field Z₂ with det A ≠ 0. Over a field, det ≠ 0 is equivalent to invertibility, so T is exactly GL₂(Z/2Z).
- In Lean, `Units (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) (ZMod 2))` is the standard representation of the group of invertible 2×2 matrices over ZMod 2. Using `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)` for S₃ is standard.
- The statement asserts a multiplicative equivalence, which is a group isomorphism. This matches “isomorphic to S₃.”

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The only mild representational difference is that Lean uses the type of units rather than the subset {A | det A ≠ 0}, but over a field these correspond exactly. This is a standard, faithful formalization.
- No vacuous placeholders are introduced; all types and structures are standard Mathlib. There are no auxiliary definitions.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib. No issue.
- `/-- There are infinitely many primes congruent to -1 modulo 4. -/`: A docstring stating the intended theorem.
- `theorem exists_prime_congruent_3_mod_4 (N : Nat) : ∃ p : Nat, p > N ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ p % 4 = 3 := by sorry`:
  This theorem states: For every natural number N, there exists a natural number p such that p > N, p is prime, and p % 4 = 3. This is the standard formalization of “there are infinitely many primes congruent to 3 modulo 4.” Equivalently, congruent to −1 modulo 4.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to −1 (mod 4).”
- The Lean statement: For every N, there exists a prime p > N with p % 4 = 3.
- Using p % 4 = 3 is equivalent to p ≡ 3 (mod 4), which is the same as p ≡ −1 (mod 4). The quantification over all N expresses infinitude. This exactly matches the mathematical content.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement with `sorry` (proof omitted) is present. This is acceptable for translation checking.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same: both express infinitude of primes congruent to −1 mod 4 (i.e., 3 mod 4). No discrepancies or unintended strengthening/weakening. Using `% 4 = 3` instead of `Nat.ModEq 4 3` is equivalent in this context.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_6c : Irreducible ((Polynomial.X : Polynomial (ZMod 31)) ^ 3 - Polynomial.C (9 : ZMod 31)) := by sorry` states the theorem that the polynomial X^3 − C(9) over the coefficient ring ZMod 31 is irreducible. Here, `Polynomial.X` is the indeterminate x, `ZMod 31` is the ring of integers modulo 31 (a field since 31 is prime), and `Polynomial.C (9 : ZMod 31)` is the constant polynomial 9. Thus the polynomial is x^3 − 9 over F_31.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language claim is: “Prove that x^3 − 9 is irreducible in F_31.” The Lean statement asserts that the polynomial x^3 − 9 in Polynomial (ZMod 31) is irreducible. Since F_31 is (canonically) ZMod 31, this is exactly the same mathematical statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain/ring: F_31 vs ZMod 31 — these are the same field. No issue.
- Polynomial: x^3 − 9 vs X^3 − C(9) — identical representations in Lean notation.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly expresses the irreducibility claim.
Therefore, the code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, including the definitions of Gaussian integers and the divisibility relation.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Artin_exercise_11_2_13 (a b : Int) : (a : GaussianInt) ∣ (b : GaussianInt) → a ∣ b := by sorry`
  This says: For any integers a and b, if the coercion of a to GaussianInt divides the coercion of b to GaussianInt (i.e., a divides b in the ring Z[i]), then a divides b in the integers Z. The arrow `→` expresses the implication. The coercions `(a : GaussianInt)` and `(b : GaussianInt)` are the natural embeddings of integers into Gaussian integers. The `∣` is the standard divisibility relation in the respective rings.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: “If a, b are integers and if a divides b in the ring of Gauss integers, then a divides b in Z.” The Lean statement matches this exactly: it universally quantifies over integers a, b, assumes divisibility in Gaussian integers, and concludes divisibility in Z. There are no extra or missing hypotheses. The use of coercions explicitly captures “considered as Gaussian integers.”

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions (`GaussianInt`, divisibility). The structure (universal quantification with an implication) matches the natural language “if a, b are integers … then …”. No generalization or specialization beyond the original meaning.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_6_4_12 (G : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 224) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: For any type G equipped with a group structure and finite type structure, if the cardinality of G is 224, then G is not a simple group.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that no group of order 224 is simple."" The Lean theorem universally quantifies over all groups G with `Fintype.card G = 224` and concludes `¬ IsSimpleGroup G`. This is exactly the formal version of ""no group of order 224 is simple."" There are no extra assumptions or weakenings; [Fintype G] is the formal way to state finiteness, and `Fintype.card G = 224` is precisely ""order 224"". The conclusion `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` matches ""is not simple"".

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only the theorem statement.
- The presence of `sorry` for the proof is acceptable per the instructions (we are evaluating translation, not proof). The theorem statement is exactly the intended meaning. No generalization or specialization beyond the statement.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The docstring states the intended content: exactly (p - 1)/2 of the nonzero elements of ZMod p are squares, and (p - 1)/2 are non-squares, for p an odd prime.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_4_9 (p : ℕ) [NeZero p] (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hp2 : p ≠ 2) ...` introduces a natural number p, assumes p ≠ 0 (technical), p is prime, and p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime). The extra `[DecidablePred ...]` hypotheses are technical decidability assumptions for filtering finite sets; they do not change the mathematical content.
- The conclusion:
  (p - 1) / 2 equals the cardinality of the set `{a ∈ ZMod p | a ≠ 0 ∧ IsSquare a}` and also equals the cardinality of the set `{a ∈ ZMod p | a ≠ 0 ∧ ¬ IsSquare a}`. Here `Finset.univ` is all elements of ZMod p, `filter` picks those satisfying the predicate, and `IsSquare (a : ZMod p)` means a is a square in the ring ZMod p. The conjunction `∧` in the theorem states both equalities simultaneously.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement counts among the integers 1, 2, ..., p − 1, i.e., the nonzero residue classes modulo p. The code counts among all elements of ZMod p with the condition `a ≠ 0`. These are canonically in bijection, so this is equivalent.
- “Quadratic residues mod p” are exactly the nonzero squares in ZMod p. `IsSquare` in ZMod p captures being a square, and the filter includes `a ≠ 0`, so it counts nonzero quadratic residues. The second set counts the nonresidues (nonzero elements that are not squares).
- The assumption that p is an odd prime appears as `Nat.Prime p` and `p ≠ 2`. This matches the intended setting. The `NeZero p` is a harmless technicality implied by primality.
- The equalities to `(p - 1) / 2` assert that exactly half of the nonzero classes are squares and half are non-squares.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The Lean statement precisely formalizes the claim that among the nonzero residue classes modulo an odd prime p, exactly (p − 1)/2 are quadratic residues and (p − 1)/2 are quadratic nonresidues. The shift from integers 1..p−1 to ZMod p \ {0} is a standard, faithful rephrasing.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; there are no auxiliary definitions; only technical decidability instances are required.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem artin_exercise_10_4_7a (I J : Ideal R) (h : I + J = ⊤) : I * J = I ⊓ J := by sorry`: States the theorem: for ideals I and J of R, if their sum equals the top ideal (i.e., I + J = R), then the product ideal I * J equals the infimum I ⊓ J, which for ideals is the intersection I ∩ J. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we are only checking the statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Natural language: ""Let I, J be ideals of a ring R such that I+J=R. Prove that IJ = I ∩ J.""
- Lean: In a commutative ring R, for ideals I, J with I + J = ⊤ (i.e., R), we have I * J = I ⊓ J (i.e., I ∩ J). This matches the standard interpretation of the statement, with the product ideal and intersection of ideals.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean version assumes R is a commutative ring (`[CommRing R]`), whereas the natural language says ""ring R"" without specifying commutativity. The equality IJ = I ∩ J under I + J = R typically requires commutativity (or additional hypotheses) to assert IJ rather than IJ + JI. Thus the Lean statement is a natural and standard specialization that ensures correctness. This slight specialization is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement with a `sorry` proof. The mathematical content of the statement aligns with the original.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization (slight specialization to commutative rings) of the natural language statement.

  This declares a theorem for any type G with a group structure and any element x : G, asserting `orderOf x = orderOf x⁻¹`. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""For x an element in G show that x and x^{-1} have the same order.""
- The Lean statement precisely matches this: in a group `G`, for any `x : G`, `orderOf x = orderOf x⁻¹`.
- In Mathlib, `orderOf : α → ℕ` encodes infinite order as `0`. Equality of `orderOf x` and `orderOf x⁻¹` thus expresses “same order” in both finite and infinite cases. This is a standard and faithful formalization.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. No extra hypotheses are added, none omitted. The context is exactly a group. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The minor formalization detail (order as a Nat with `0` meaning infinite) does not change the meaning of the claim.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the statement.

- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_17 (h : orderOf x = n) (hn : 0 < n) : x⁻¹ = x^(n - 1)` states: If the order of `x` is `n` and `n > 0`, then the inverse of `x` equals `x` raised to the power `n − 1`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Let x be an element of G. Prove that if |x| = n for some positive integer n then x^{-1} = x^{n-1}.”
- In Lean, `orderOf x = n` exactly formalizes `|x| = n`, and `0 < n` asserts that `n` is a positive integer. The conclusion `x⁻¹ = x^(n - 1)` matches `x^{-1} = x^{n-1}`. The context `[Group G]` matches “x is an element of a group G.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct.
- The use of `Nat` and subtraction `n - 1` in Lean is standard and consistent with the intended meaning when `n > 0`.

- The formal statement is the same as the natural language statement: same hypotheses (group element, positive finite order n) and same conclusion. No extra assumptions or restrictions, no generalization or specialization beyond the original. Hence, fully faithful.

- `theorem prod_inv_rev {G : Type _} [Group G] (l : List G) : (l.prod)⁻¹ = (l.reverse.map fun x => x⁻¹).prod := by sorry`
  This states: For any group G and any finite list l of elements of G, the inverse of the product of the elements of l equals the product of the inverses of the elements taken in reverse order. Here `List.prod` is the product over the list (with multiplication in G), `l.reverse` reverses the list, and `map (fun x => x⁻¹)` replaces each element by its inverse. Thus, `(l.prod)⁻¹ = (l.reverse.map (·⁻¹)).prod`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
This matches the natural language statement: for any elements a₁, …, aₙ in a group G, (a₁ a₂ … aₙ)⁻¹ = aₙ⁻¹ … a₂⁻¹ a₁⁻¹. The list `l` corresponds to the finite sequence (a₁, …, aₙ). The right-hand side constructs the reversed sequence and multiplies inverses, exactly as in the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement quantifies over all finite lists, which includes the case n = 0 (empty product). The natural language statement typically assumes n ≥ 1, but the identity also holds for n = 0 (both sides are 1), so this is a harmless slight generalization allowed by the guidelines.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib constructs.
Hence, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_6a : Irreducible (X ^ 2 + X + C (1 : ZMod 2) : Polynomial (ZMod 2)) := by sorry`
  This states: In the polynomial ring over `ZMod 2` (the ring/field with two elements, i.e., F₂), the polynomial `X^2 + X + 1` is irreducible. Here, `C (1 : ZMod 2)` embeds the element 1 of `ZMod 2` as the constant polynomial 1, so the full polynomial is exactly x^2 + x + 1 over F₂. `Irreducible` is Mathlib’s standard notion of irreducibility for polynomials.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to prove that x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible in the field F₂. The Lean statement precisely asserts that the polynomial X^2 + X + 1 in `Polynomial (ZMod 2)` is irreducible. Since `ZMod 2` is (canonically) the field F₂, this is the same statement.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem statement directly encodes the intended claim. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

- `theorem zmod_mul_assoc (n : ℕ) (x y z : ZMod n) : (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) := by sorry` declares a theorem: for any natural number n and any elements x, y, z in ZMod n (the ring of integers modulo n), the multiplication is associative, i.e., (x*y)*z = x*(y*z). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove that multiplication in the residue class ring Z/nZ is associative. The Lean statement exactly expresses that for arbitrary n and elements in ZMod n, the equality (x*y)*z = x*(y*z) holds. This is precisely the associativity of multiplication in Z/nZ.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope over n: The Lean statement quantifies over all n : ℕ, which is standard and intended. Associativity holds for all n (including n = 0 in Mathlib's ZMod, which is isomorphic to ℤ), so this is not a problematic generalization.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it directly states the associativity property for ZMod n.
- The statement matches exactly the mathematical content of the natural language.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_6_23 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]` introduces a type `G` with a group structure and assumes `G` is finite. This matches “Let G be a finite group.”
- `(σ : G ≃* G)` specifies that `σ` is a group automorphism (a multiplicative group equivalence), matching “possesses an automorphism σ.”
- `(h_fixed : ∀ g : G, σ g = g ↔ g = 1)` states that the fixed points of `σ` are exactly the identity element. This matches “σ(g) = g iff g = 1.”
- `(h_inv2 : ∀ g : G, σ (σ g) = g)` states that `σ^2` is the identity function on `G`, i.e., σ is an involution. This matches “σ^2 is the identity map from G to G.”
- Conclusion `∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a` asserts that multiplication in `G` is commutative for all elements, i.e., `G` is abelian.

Whole translation assessment:
- The Lean theorem exactly formalizes the natural language statement: finite group, an automorphism σ with only the identity fixed, and σ^2 = id imply commutativity. There are no extraneous or missing assumptions. The expression of abelianness as `∀ a b, a * b = b * a` is a standard and faithful way to state that `G` is abelian.

Final check: same or different?
- They are the same. All components (finiteness, automorphism, fixed points condition, involution property, and abelian conclusion) align precisely. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code gives only a theorem statement with these hypotheses and the desired conclusion. Thus, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib's library.

Proof omitted. Note: Ideal.span {p} denotes the principal ideal (p).

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show: (1) p and q are irreducible in F[x]; (2) the fields F[x]/(p(x)) and F[x]/(q(x)) are isomorphic.
- The Lean theorems p_irreducible and q_irreducible exactly assert irreducibility of p and q in Polynomial F. This matches (1).
- The final theorem asserts an isomorphism (≃+*) between the quotient rings Polynomial F ⧸ Ideal.span {p} and Polynomial F ⧸ Ideal.span {q}. Over a field F, quotients by irreducible polynomials are fields; a ring isomorphism between fields is automatically a field isomorphism. Thus the statement matches (2) in mathematical meaning. Although the Lean statement does not explicitly assert these quotients are fields, it states exactly the needed isomorphism of the underlying rings, which is what “fields are isomorphic” means in this context.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The polynomials are defined correctly as x^3 − 2 and x^3 + 2 over F = Z_7. Irreducibility claims are correctly stated. The isomorphism is between the quotient rings by the principal ideals generated by p and q, i.e., F[x]/(p) and F[x]/(q). The minor nuance that the Lean statement uses ring isomorphism rather than explicitly a field isomorphism is acceptable and standard, since both quotients are fields under the irreducibility hypotheses.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; p and q are genuine polynomials, and the final theorem directly asserts the isomorphism without introducing fake structures.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the standard Mathlib library; no issue.
- The docstring states exactly the natural language proposition: for a finite group G and proper subgroup H, there exists a maximal subgroup M containing H.
- The theorem signature: `theorem exists_maximal_subgroup_of_finite_group {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] (H : Subgroup G) (hproper : H ≠ (⊤ : Subgroup G)) : ...` translates to: Let G be a finite group (Group G and Fintype G). Let H be a subgroup of G with H ≠ ⊤ (i.e., H is a proper subgroup).
- The conclusion: `∃ M : Subgroup G, M ≠ (⊤ : Subgroup G) ∧ H ≤ M ∧ ∀ K : Subgroup G, M ≤ K → (K = M ∨ K = (⊤ : Subgroup G))` translates to: There exists a subgroup M of G such that M ≠ G (i.e., M is not the whole group), H ≤ M (H is contained in M), and for every subgroup K of G, if M ≤ K then K = M or K = G. This is exactly the definition of M being a maximal subgroup of G that contains H.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions: `Subgroup G`, `⊤` for the whole group as a subgroup, `≤` for inclusion among subgroups.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines a maximal subgroup M of G as M ≠ G and the only subgroups containing M are M and G. The theorem to prove: If H is a proper subgroup of finite G, then there exists a maximal subgroup containing H.
- The Lean statement precisely matches this: it assumes finiteness (`[Fintype G]`), H proper (`H ≠ ⊤`), and concludes existence of an M with `M ≠ ⊤`, `H ≤ M`, and the maximality condition (`∀ K, M ≤ K → (K = M ∨ K = ⊤)`).
- The use of `⊤ : Subgroup G` corresponds exactly to the whole group G. The containment and maximality conditions are formalized correctly.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical content. No extraneous restrictions or generalizations were introduced, and no vacuous placeholders are used. The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's libraries.
- `theorem product_nonzero_elements_eq_neg_one {K : Type*} [Field K] [Fintype K] [DecidableEq K] : ... := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for any type `K` equipped with a `Field` structure (commutative field), a `Fintype` instance (so `K` has finitely many elements), and decidable equality (a technical requirement for using `Finset`). The statement is:
  `(Finset.prod ((Finset.univ : Finset K).erase (0 : K)) (fun x => x)) = -1`
  which means: take the finite set of all elements of `K`, remove `0`, and compute the product over that set of the identity function `fun x => x`; this product equals `-1` in `K`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Let K be a finite field. Prove that the product of the nonzero elements of K is -1.""
- The Lean statement assumes `K` is a field and finite (`[Field K] [Fintype K]`), exactly matching ""finite field"". It then asserts the product over all nonzero elements equals `-1`. The use of `Finset.univ.erase 0` precisely selects the nonzero elements of `K`. The function `(fun x => x)` means we multiply the elements themselves. The right-hand side `-1` is the additive inverse of `1` in `K`, as intended.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only extra hypothesis is `[DecidableEq K]`, a standard technical requirement to form a `Finset` over `K`; it does not change the mathematical content.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is no cheating. The statement is exactly the classical result and covers the edge case `|K|=2` where `-1=1` automatically.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: Use Mathlib's polynomial library.
- Comment: States Herstein Exercise 5.6.14 and says the approach is to show the derivative of X^(p^n) - X is nonzero.
- The theorem:
  `theorem herstein_exercise_5_6_14 {F : Type _} [Field F] {p : ℕ} (hp : CharP F p) (hp0 : p ≠ 0) (n : ℕ) : derivative ((Polynomial.X : Polynomial F) ^ (p ^ n) - Polynomial.X) ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  Translating: For a field F of characteristic p (CharP F p) with p ≠ 0, and any n : ℕ, the derivative of the polynomial X^(p^n) - X over F is nonzero.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""If F is of characteristic p ≠ 0, show that all the roots of x^m - x, where m = p^n, are distinct.""
- Mathematical meaning: The polynomial f(X) = X^(p^n) - X has no repeated roots (is squarefree) over F (equivalently over an algebraic closure).
- The Lean theorem only asserts: derivative(f) ≠ 0. While in this specific situation, in characteristic p, derivative(f) = (p^n) X^(p^n - 1) - 1 = -1, a nonzero constant, which indeed implies gcd(f, f') = 1 and hence no repeated roots, the theorem itself stops at derivative ≠ 0 and does not state the desired ""roots are distinct"" (squarefree/separable) conclusion.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly weaker than the natural language statement. In general, f' ≠ 0 does not imply that f has distinct roots; one needs coprimality gcd(f, f') = 1 (or an explicit squarefree/separable statement). Although here f' = -1 makes that true, the code does not assert or conclude it.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Same setup: field F, characteristic p ≠ 0, polynomial X^(p^n) - X is the same.
- Difference: The natural language statement concludes ""all roots are distinct"" (squarefree). The Lean code only proves (states) ""derivative ≠ 0"". It neither states f' = -1 nor that gcd(f, f') = 1 nor that the polynomial is squarefree/has distinct roots. Thus it is not a faithful translation, though it is a closely related and useful intermediate fact.
- No vacuous definitions; all terms are legitimate Mathlib definitions and the statement typechecks. The mismatch is purely that the formal statement is weaker than the intended conclusion.

Verdict: Not faithful, but close. A more faithful Lean statement would assert that X^(p^n) - X is squarefree or separable (or explicitly that it has no repeated roots), possibly deduced using that its derivative is -1.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_22b {G : Type _} [Group G] (a b : G) : orderOf (a * b) = orderOf (b * a) := by sorry`
  This states: For any group G and any elements a, b in G, the order of the element a * b equals the order of the element b * a. Here `orderOf` is Mathlib’s standard notion of the order of an element in a (semi)group: the least positive n with (a^n = 1), or 0 if no such n exists (infinite order). There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement “Deduce that |a b| = |b a| for all a, b in a group G” uses |x| to denote the order of the element x. The Lean term `orderOf (a * b)` is exactly this notion. The universal quantification over all a, b in a group G is precisely captured by the theorem’s parameters `(a b : G)` and `[Group G]`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code exactly matches the mathematical content: it asserts equality of orders of ab and ba for all elements in any group G. No extra hypotheses, no restrictions to finite groups, and the interpretation of |x| as the order of an element aligns with Mathlib’s `orderOf`. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof, which is acceptable for assessing faithfulness of the statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: We work in an arbitrary group G.
- `variable (H K : Subgroup G) [Fintype H] [Fintype K]`: H and K are subgroups of G, and both H and K are finite (they have Fintype instances).
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_2_8 (h_coprime : Nat.Coprime (Fintype.card H) (Fintype.card K)) : (H ⊓ K : Subgroup G) = ⊥ := by sorry`: If the orders of H and K (given by Fintype.card H and Fintype.card K) are coprime, then the intersection of H and K (written as the infimum H ⊓ K in the lattice of subgroups, i.e., their subgroup intersection) equals ⊥, the trivial subgroup {1}.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Natural language: ""If H and K are finite subgroups of G whose orders are relatively prime then H ∩ K = 1."" Here 1 denotes the trivial subgroup.
- Lean statement: assumes H and K are finite subgroups, assumes Nat.Coprime (|H|, |K|), concludes H ⊓ K = ⊥ (the trivial subgroup). This matches exactly: ⊓ is subgroup intersection and ⊥ is the trivial subgroup. No extra or missing hypotheses.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content is the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The environment matches the intended generality (G arbitrary group). The proof is a placeholder, but the task concerns translation of the statement, not the proof.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `def S_Omega : Type := Equiv.Perm ℕ`: Define S_Omega to be the type of permutations of the natural numbers. In Mathlib, `Equiv.Perm α` has a canonical group structure `[Group (Equiv.Perm α)]`, so this indeed denotes the (symmetric) group of all permutations of ℕ.
- `theorem S_Omega_infinite : Infinite S_Omega := by sorry`: State that S_Omega is an infinite type, i.e., there are infinitely many permutations of ℕ. The proof is omitted, but the statement itself is clear and meaningful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""Prove that if Ω = {1,2,3,...} then S_Ω is an infinite group."" Here Ω is identified with the natural numbers. The code sets Ω implicitly to ℕ and defines S_Ω as `Equiv.Perm ℕ`, which is the standard formalization of the symmetric group on ℕ in Mathlib. The theorem asserts `Infinite S_Omega`, i.e., that there are infinitely many elements. The group structure is inherent from the typeclass instance on `Equiv.Perm ℕ`.

Thus, the essential mathematical content—S_Ω is a group (by standard instance) and it has infinitely many elements—is captured. The Lean code focuses on the nontrivial part (infinitude) since the group structure is definitional for permutations.

3) Final check for differences:
- The identification Ω = {1,2,3,...} matches ℕ used in the code.
- The code states infinitude; the group structure is implicitly provided by `Equiv.Perm`'s instance, matching the phrase ""is an infinite group."" No vacuous placeholders are used; `S_Omega` is a legitimate Mathlib type.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the standard math library.
- The docstring accurately restates the natural language proposition: H is an additive subgroup of the rationals, and for every nonzero x in H, x⁻¹ (the multiplicative inverse, i.e., 1/x) is also in H; conclude H is trivial or all of Q.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_2_1_13 (H : AddSubgroup Rat) (h : ∀ x ∈ H, x ≠ 0 → x⁻¹ ∈ H) : H = (⊥ : AddSubgroup Rat) ∨ H = (⊤ : AddSubgroup Rat) := by sorry`
  • `H : AddSubgroup Rat` means H is an additive subgroup of the rational numbers.
  • `h : ∀ x ∈ H, x ≠ 0 → x⁻¹ ∈ H` encodes: for every element x of H, if x ≠ 0 then 1/x belongs to H. This matches the phrase “for every nonzero x ∈ H we have x⁻¹ ∈ H.”
  • The conclusion `H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤` means H is either the zero subgroup or the whole group of rationals.
  • The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for the auditing of the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The Lean theorem precisely states that an additive subgroup H of Q with the property that every nonzero element has its reciprocal also in H must be either the trivial subgroup or the whole group. This matches “H = 0 or Q.”
- The conditional formulation `x ≠ 0 → ...` is logically equivalent to quantifying over nonzero elements.
- The use of `AddSubgroup Rat`, `⊥`, and `⊤` is the standard formalization of “subgroup of the additive group of rationals,” “0,” and “Q,” respectively.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms come from Mathlib.
- There are no discrepancies in scope or strength. The Lean statement is neither a generalization nor a specialization beyond the intended claim.
- Therefore, the two problems are the same in mathematical meaning.

  • For a natural number p with an instance `[Fact p.Prime]` (i.e., assuming p is prime), and for any integer a, the conclusion is `a ^ p ≡ a [ZMOD p]`, which is the standard Lean notation for congruence modulo p over the integers.
  • The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement itself is precise.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts Fermat's Little Theorem: for prime p, a^p ≡ a (mod p) for all integers a. The Lean statement exactly asserts this congruence for all integers a and prime p.
- The mention of ""Use Lagrange's Theorem"" describes a method of proof, not part of the formal statement. The code's theorem statement need not encode the method, only the result, so this is fine.
- Types and notations match Mathlib conventions: `a : ℤ`, exponent `p : ℕ`, and congruence `[ZMOD p]` are all appropriate.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. No discrepancies in quantifiers or domains: p is prime, a ranges over ℤ, and the congruence modulo p is asserted. The theorem name is a bit misleading (suggesting equality to 1), but the statement itself is correct and faithful.

  This declares a definition that, given types A and B with group structures, produces a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between the product group A × B and B × A. The `by sorry` indicates the proof/construction is omitted, but the statement itself is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asserts there is a group isomorphism A × B ≅ B × A. In Lean, `A × B ≃* B × A` is exactly the type of a group isomorphism (multiplicative equivalence) between the product groups. The hypotheses `[Group A] [Group B]` match ""A and B are groups"". Thus, the statement matches perfectly.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean code uses a `def` giving an explicit isomorphism rather than a `theorem` asserting existence; this is a standard and slightly stronger formalization and is faithful to the intended statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The use of `noncomputable` does not change the mathematical content.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If a ∈ C satisfies p(a) = 0 with p(x) = x^5 + √2 x^3 + √5 x^2 + √7 x + √11, show that a is algebraic over ℚ of degree at most 80.
- The Lean theorem asserts the existence of a nonzero q ∈ ℚ[x] with deg(q) ≤ 80 and q(a) = 0. This is a standard and faithful formalization of “a is algebraic over ℚ of degree at most 80,” since exhibiting any nonzero rational polynomial of degree ≤ 80 annihilating a implies that the minimal polynomial of a over ℚ has degree ≤ 80.
- The polynomial p is exactly as specified, with coefficients interpreted as the (positive) real square roots embedded into ℂ.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- Domain of a: The Lean code fixes a ∈ ℂ, while the natural statement writes a ∈ C (likely denoting ℂ). Even if C were intended as any field containing those square roots, specializing to ℂ is a harmless specialization and still a faithful translation for the usual reading.
- Expression of “degree at most 80”: Lean uses existence of a nonzero q ∈ ℚ[x] with Polynomial.degree q ≤ 80, which is equivalent to the intended minimal polynomial bound. Using WithBot ℕ is just the standard type for polynomial degrees in Mathlib.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; p is defined concretely, and the theorem states the correct existential claim. The proof is omitted, which is permitted.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful formalization of the given natural language problem.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib.
- Docstring: ""/-- If |G| = 6545 then G is not simple. -/"" — matches the natural language statement.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_19 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 6545) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry` translates to: For any type G equipped with a group structure and a finite type structure (so G is a finite group), if the cardinality of G is 6545, then G is not a simple group. This uses Mathlib’s standard `IsSimpleGroup` predicate.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean statement precisely captures: if a group G has order 6545, then G is not simple. It assumes finiteness via `[Fintype G]` and uses `Fintype.card G = 6545` to express |G| = 6545. The conclusion `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` is exactly “G is not simple.” No extraneous assumptions are added.

3) Comparison to the original statement:
They are the same. The Lean code does not introduce any vacuous or auxiliary definitions, and it uses standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable here since we are only auditing the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line-by-line.
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- The module docstring states the same exercise: a finite abelian group has a subgroup of order n for each positive divisor n of its order.
- `open Classical` allows classical choice, etc.
- The theorem:
  - `theorem exists_subgroup_of_card_dvd {G : Type*} [CommGroup G] [Fintype G] (n : ℕ)
    (h : n ∣ Fintype.card G) : ∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = n := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type G with a commutative group structure (so G is abelian) and finite (Fintype G), and any natural number n such that n divides the order of G (Fintype.card G), there exists a subgroup H of G with cardinality n.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- ""finite abelian group"" matches `[CommGroup G] [Fintype G]`.
- ""has a subgroup of order n for each positive divisor n of its order"" matches `∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = n` given `h : n ∣ Fintype.card G`.
- Positivity of n: In Lean, n : ℕ and the hypothesis `n ∣ Fintite.card G` with `Fintite.card G ≥ 1` (since groups are nonempty) implies n ≠ 0, so this effectively captures “positive divisor.”
- The proof method (Cauchy + induction) is not encoded, but the task here is the statement translation, not the proof strategy. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Quantifiers and conditions match exactly: finite abelian group, n dividing |G|, existence of a subgroup of order n.
- No extra or missing conditions. The slight omission of explicitly stating n > 0 is compensated by the divisibility condition and the positivity of |G| in this context.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's definitions and theorems.
- Docstring: States the mathematical content: a surjective group homomorphism from a solvable group has solvable codomain; in particular, quotients of a solvable group are solvable by taking the canonical projection.

  Natural language: For groups G and H, if f : G → H is a surjective group homomorphism and G is solvable, then H is solvable.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The original statement says: ""quotient groups of a solvable group are solvable."" The Lean theorem asserts a slightly more general fact: solvability is preserved under surjective homomorphisms. Since any quotient H ≅ G/N arises from the canonical surjection f : G → G/N (and any surjective homomorphism has H ≅ G/ker f), the Lean statement directly implies the original statement. The docstring explicitly notes this implication.

3) Final check:
The mathematical content matches, with the Lean theorem being a standard generalization of the natural language statement. There are no vacuous or misleading auxiliary definitions; there are none at all. The presence of `sorry` is about the proof, not the statement. The terms used (Group, IsSolvable, surjectivity, group homomorphism) are standard Mathlib notions. Hence, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib; standard.
- The comment describes the exercise: If H and K are normal subgroups of G, then H ∩ K is normal.
- `theorem subgroup_intersection_normal {G : Type*} [Group G] {H K : Subgroup G}`: Let G be a group and H, K be subgroups of G.
- Hypotheses:
  - `hH : ∀ g x, x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H`: For all g in G and x in H, the conjugate g x g⁻¹ lies in H. This is the standard “H is normal in G” property.
  - `hK : ∀ g x, x ∈ K → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ K`: Similarly, K is normal in G.
- Conclusion:
  - `(∀ g x, x ∈ (H ⊓ K) → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ (H ⊓ K))`: For all g in G and x in the intersection H ⊓ K (which for subgroups is the infimum, i.e., set-theoretic intersection), the conjugate g x g⁻¹ lies in H ⊓ K. This is precisely the property that H ∩ K is normal in G.
- The proof is omitted (`:= by sorry`), but the statement is clear and uses no vacuous placeholders.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: If H and K are normal subgroups of a group G, then H ∩ K is a normal subgroup of G.
- The Lean statement assumes H and K are subgroups and imposes the defining normality condition for each (closed under conjugation by any g ∈ G). It concludes that their intersection is closed under conjugation, i.e., is normal.
- Using `H ⊓ K` for the intersection of subgroups is standard in Mathlib and matches H ∩ K.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib constructs. The absence of a proof is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

Final check:
- The mathematical content of the Lean theorem matches exactly the natural language statement. There are no mismatches or generalizations beyond the intended meaning.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard library.
- The theorem statement:
  - `(G : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G]`: G is a type with a group structure and is finite.
  - `(h : Fintype.card G = 2907)`: The order of G is 2907.
  - Conclusion `¬ IsSimpleGroup G`: G is not a simple group.
  - `by sorry`: No proof provided (acceptable for translation auditing).

Step 2: Faithfulness of the whole translation
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that if |G| = 2907 then G is not simple.""
- The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: for any finite group G with |G| = 2907, G is not simple.
- `IsSimpleGroup` is the standard Mathlib predicate meaning “G is simple,” so `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` matches “G is not simple.”

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present.
- The assumptions and conclusion match precisely. Requiring `[Fintype G]` is standard and consistent with specifying `Fintype.card G = 2907`.
- No mismatch or generalization/specialization beyond the intended statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Comment: States the intended reformulation: ""A × B is an abelian group iff A and B are abelian"" is encoded as an existence-of-instances statement: `Nonempty (CommGroup (G × H)) ↔ (Nonempty (CommGroup G) ∧ Nonempty (CommGroup H))`.
- Theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_29 (G H : Type*) : Nonempty (CommGroup (G × H)) ↔ (Nonempty (CommGroup G) ∧ Nonempty (CommGroup H)) := by sorry`:
  This asserts: for any types G and H, there exists a commutative group structure on the product type G × H if and only if there exist commutative group structures on G and on H. No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is the classical group-theory fact: If A and B are (given) groups, then A × B with the product group structure is abelian iff A and B (with their given group structures) are abelian.
- The Lean statement instead quantifies over bare types G and H and speaks about the existence of some commutative group structure on G × H being equivalent to the existence of (some) commutative group structures on G and H. This is an existence-of-structure equivalence, not a statement about the abelianness of the product relative to already-given group structures on A and B.
- In particular, the original statement presupposes fixed group structures on A and B and speaks about the product group derived from them. The Lean statement does not assume prior group structures on G or H and instead reasons about whether such structures exist. These are different logical formulations (different quantifier/structure contexts).

3) Final comparison:
- Similarity: Both concern the relationship between abelianness of a product and abelianness of the factors.
- Difference: The original is about the product of given group structures; the Lean code is about existence of commutative group structures on the types. This is a substantive change in meaning, not just a harmless technicality. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: It's closely related and captures a thematically similar equivalence but changes the quantification and the nature of the claim, so it is ""almost the same but not faithful"" per the rubric.

Without any Lean code, there is no formal statement or definition in Lean to compare with the natural language statement. Hence, the translation cannot be faithful.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same? Since there is no Lean theorem/definition present at all, the Lean side is empty and thus not the same as the given statement. This constitutes a complete failure to translate.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib, providing standard group theory and finiteness notions.
- Docstring `/-- If |G| = 462 then G is not simple. -/`: Describes the intended theorem in natural language.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_23 (G : Type*) [Group G] [Finite G] (h : Nat.card G = 462) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  - This states: For any type `G` with a group structure `[Group G]` and with `G` finite `[Finite G]`, if `Nat.card G = 462` (the order of `G` equals 462), then `G` is not a simple group (`¬ IsSimpleGroup G`).

Assessment of fidelity:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that if |G| = 462 then G is not simple.” The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: given a group `G` of order 462, `G` is not simple.
- The use of `Nat.card G = 462` faithfully represents `|G| = 462`. `IsSimpleGroup G` is Mathlib’s standard predicate for simplicity of a group. The negation `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` matches “not simple.”
- The extra typeclass assumption `[Finite G]` is a standard Lean technicality. It does not change the mathematical content; from `Nat.card G = 462` one can infer finiteness anyway, and including `[Finite G]` is a harmless and typical formalization detail.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem statement directly matches the claim. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing per the instructions.

Final check: The math problems are the same. No differences in meaning were found. The code is a faithful formal restatement of the natural language claim.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line-by-line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, so standard definitions like `IsNilpotent` and `IsUnit` are legitimate.
- The docstring accurately paraphrases the statement: if `a` is nilpotent in a commutative ring `R` with `1 ≠ 0`, then `1 - a * b` is a unit for all `b`.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_4_27 {R : Type _} [CommRing R] (h1 : (1 : R) ≠ 0) {a b : R} (ha : IsNilpotent a) : IsUnit (1 - a * b) := by sorry`
  • `R : Type _` with `[CommRing R]`: R is a commutative ring.
  • `(h1 : (1 : R) ≠ 0)`: Assumes `1 ≠ 0` (nontrivial ring).
  • `{a b : R}`: Elements `a, b` of `R` (arbitrary, with `b` implicitly universally quantified).
  • `(ha : IsNilpotent a)`: `a` is nilpotent (Mathlib's standard predicate).
  • Conclusion: `IsUnit (1 - a * b)`: `1 - ab` is a unit.
  • `sorry`: No proof provided, but we only audit the statement.

Step 2: Assess fidelity to the natural language.
- Natural language: Let `R` be a commutative ring with `1 ≠ 0`. If `a` is nilpotent, then for all `b ∈ R`, `1 - ab` is a unit.
- Lean theorem matches: same ring assumptions, `a` nilpotent, for arbitrary `b`, `1 - a*b` is a unit. The universal quantification over `b` is captured by having `b` as an arbitrary variable in the theorem statement.

Step 3: Final comparison and discrepancies.
- The formal statement is a faithful translation. It slightly specializes to commutative rings, which matches the natural statement. The extra hypothesis `h1 : 1 ≠ 0` is included as in the natural statement, even if it’s not logically necessary; that’s fine. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; `IsNilpotent` and `IsUnit` are standard Mathlib.
- No auxiliary definitions; no red flags. The statement is essentially identical to the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

- Theorem statement: For any commutative ring R and polynomial p : R[X], the statement `(∃ q : R[X], q ≠ 0 ∧ p * q = 0) ↔ (∃ b : R, b ≠ 0 ∧ C b * p = 0)`.
  • Left side: There exists a nonzero polynomial q such that p*q = 0 (zero polynomial). This is the standard formalization of “p is a zero divisor in R[X]”. Since R[X] is commutative, using p*q rather than q*p is immaterial.
  • Right side: There exists a nonzero element b in R such that (the constant polynomial C b) times p is zero, which is exactly the ring-theoretic meaning of b p(x) = 0 in the polynomial ring.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: p(x) ∈ R[x] is a zero divisor iff there exists a nonzero b ∈ R with b p(x) = 0.
- The Lean statement precisely captures this equivalence. Using `C b * p = 0` matches “b p(x) = 0,” since in Lean the scalar action of R on R[X] is given by multiplication by the constant polynomial `C b`.
- No extra assumptions are introduced; R is a commutative ring, as needed, and p is arbitrary in R[X].

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not introduce any vacuous or placeholder definitions; it states the theorem directly.
- The only small formalization choice is using `p * q = 0` to define zero divisor (instead of `q * p = 0`), but in the commutative ring R[X] this is equivalent and standard.
- The natural language mentions an explicit form of p(x) with coefficients; this is descriptive and not logically required. The Lean statement covers all polynomials p, which is exactly intended.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `variable (φ : R →+* S) (hφ : Function.Surjective φ)`: φ is a ring homomorphism from R to S, and hφ states that φ is surjective.
- `def center (T : Type _) [Ring T] : Set T := { x | ∀ y : T, x * y = y * x }`: Defines the center of a ring T as the set of all elements x of T that commute with every element y of T. This is the standard definition of the center as a set.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language claim: Let φ: R → S be a surjective ring homomorphism. Prove that φ(Z(R)) ⊆ Z(S). The Lean code sets up φ as a ring hom and assumes surjectivity hφ, defines the center as the set of commuting elements, and states exactly that the image of the center of R is a subset of the center of S. This matches precisely.
- Note: Surjectivity is included as a variable `hφ` in the section and thus is an implicit parameter of the theorem, matching the hypothesis in the natural language statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the definition of center is correct and meaningful.
- The theorem statement exactly matches the intended inclusion under the surjective ring homomorphism. Even though the proof is omitted (`sorry`), this is allowed per the instructions as long as the statement is faithful.
- Using a Set-based center rather than a Mathlib-provided structure is acceptable and faithful.

- The two statements match precisely: same polynomial, same ring ℤ[x], same property (irreducible). No auxiliary definitions, no weakening or strengthening. The use of `sorry` does not affect the statement; we only audit the translation of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G] {H K : Subgroup G}`: Fix a group G and subgroups H, K of G.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_4_8a` assumes:
  • `hHK : H ≤ K`: H is a subgroup contained in K.
  • `hchar : ∀ g : G, ((fun x => g * x * g⁻¹) '' (K : Set G) = (K : Set G)) → ((fun x => g * x * g⁻¹) '' (H : Set G) = (H : Set G))`:
    For every g in G, if conjugation by g preserves K setwise, then conjugation by g also preserves H setwise. This encodes a “characteristic in K” type condition but only for conjugations that normalize K.
  • `hnorm : ∀ g : G, (fun x => g * x * g⁻¹) '' (K : Set G) = (K : Set G)`:
    K is normal in G (since for each g, conjugation by g maps K onto itself).
  The conclusion is `∀ g : G, (fun x => g * x * g⁻¹) '' (H : Set G) = (H : Set G)`, i.e. H is invariant under conjugation by any g, hence H is normal in G.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Natural language statement: If H ≤ K, H is characteristic in K, and K is normal in G, then H is normal in G.
- Lean statement: Assumes H ≤ K, assumes a weakened/targeted version of “H is characteristic in K” expressed only in terms of conjugations that preserve K, and assumes K is normal in G; concludes H is normal in G.
- This is a slight generalization: the Lean assumption on “characteristic” is weaker than the usual definition (which quantifies over all automorphisms of K). However, this weaker assumption is sufficient for the desired conclusion when K is normal. Thus the Lean theorem implies the natural language theorem and is an acceptable formalization for proving the claimed result.
- All notions are expressed legitimately using Mathlib constructs (groups, subgroups, conjugation as a function, image/equality of sets). There are no vacuous placeholders or fake definitions. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is allowed for this auditing task.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  • The formalization uses a weaker formulation of “H characteristic in K” (only for conjugations normalizing K) instead of the full definition via all automorphisms of K. This makes the Lean theorem strictly stronger than the natural statement.
  • The inclusion H ≤ K is present as a hypothesis but not explicitly used in the formal characteristic condition; nonetheless it matches the natural hypothesis and is harmless.
- Conclusion matches exactly: H is normal in G.

Given this, the translation is faithful up to a benign generalization that strengthens the result; no red flags or vacuous definitions.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- Comment explains the exercise: group of order 351 has a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order; the Lean statement will assert existence and uniqueness of a Sylow p-subgroup (uniqueness implies normality).
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_15 (G : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 351) : ... := by sorry`
  This sets up a finite group `G` with `|G| = 351`.
- Conclusion: `∃ (p : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃ (P : Sylow p G), ∀ (Q : Sylow p G), Q = P`.
  In words: There exists a prime `p` and a Sylow `p`-subgroup `P` of `G` such that every Sylow `p`-subgroup `Q` equals `P`, i.e., the Sylow `p`-subgroup is unique.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “A group of order 351 has a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order.”
- The Lean statement asserts existence of a prime `p` and a unique Sylow `p`-subgroup. In finite groups, uniqueness of the Sylow `p`-subgroup is equivalent to normality of that Sylow `p`-subgroup (all Sylow subgroups are conjugate; if one is normal, it equals all its conjugates, hence is unique, and conversely uniqueness implies normal). Thus the Lean statement implies the existence of a normal Sylow `p`-subgroup and is in fact equivalent to the natural statement.
- The clause “for some prime p dividing its order” is implicitly captured: existence of a Sylow `p`-subgroup `P : Sylow p G` entails that `p` divides `|G|` in Mathlib’s setting (the type `Sylow p G` is nonempty only when `p ∣ |G|`), so even though `p ∣ |G|` is not stated explicitly, it follows from the existence of `P`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the statement (with `sorry` proof) is given.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem matches and slightly strengthens the natural language statement (uniqueness ⇒ normal). Given the equivalence of uniqueness and normality for Sylow subgroups, the two are effectively the same in this context. There are no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation: There is no Lean code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""), so there are no lines to translate into natural language, no definitions, and no theorem statements to assess.

2) Whole translation faithfulness: Since no Lean code is present, there is nothing that could formalize or state the natural language theorem about a group of order 105 having normal Sylow 5- and 7-subgroups. Therefore, the translation cannot be faithful.

3) Final comparison: The natural language statement concerns a finite group G with |G| = 105 = 3·5·7 and asserts the existence of normal Sylow 5-subgroup and normal Sylow 7-subgroup. There is no corresponding Lean theorem or definitions to compare against. They are different in that one exists and the other does not. Hence the translation fails.

If a is a unit in a ring-like structure with negation, then -a is also a unit. -/
theorem dummit_foote_exercise_7_1_2 {α : Type u} [Monoid α] [HasDistribNeg α] {a : α} :
  IsUnit a → IsUnit (-a) := by sorry
",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code declares a type α with instances [Monoid α] and [HasDistribNeg α]. This means α has a multiplicative monoid structure and a negation operation that distributes over multiplication: (-a) * b = -(a * b) and a * (-b) = -(a * b). It does not assume additive structure or that negation is involutive (i.e., -(-x) = x).
- The theorem statement is: if a is a unit (IsUnit a), then -a is also a unit (IsUnit (-a)). No auxiliary definitions are introduced.
- The docstring claims a “ring-like structure with negation,” and attempts to generalize the familiar ring result to this more general context.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that if u is a unit in R then so is -u,” where R is a ring. In a ring, negation is involutive and distributes over multiplication, so the usual proof works: if a is a unit with inverse b, then (-a) has inverse (-b) since (-a)*(-b) = a*b = 1 and (-b)*(-a) = b*a = 1.
- The Lean theorem attempts to generalize from rings to any [Monoid α] with [HasDistribNeg α]. However, in this generality, we do not have the involutive property of negation (-(-x) = x). Without that, one cannot conclude that (-a)*(-b) = a*b from the distributive laws; one only gets (-a)*(-b) = - (a * (-b)) = - (-(a*b)), which requires neg_neg to reduce to a*b. Thus, the assumptions are too weak for the statement to be generally true.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation: it is a significant (and likely incorrect) generalization beyond rings. A faithful formalization would assume [Ring R] (or at least [Monoid R], [HasDistribNeg R], and [InvolutiveNeg R]).

Final check:
- Original: in a ring R, IsUnit u → IsUnit (-u). 
- Lean: in a monoid with distributive negation (but no involutive negation assumed), IsUnit a → IsUnit (-a).
- These are different. The Lean version is too weak in assumptions and may be false in that generality, so it is not a faithful translation.

Suggested fix:
- Strengthen the typeclass assumptions, e.g., `[Monoid α] [HasDistribNeg α] [InvolutiveNeg α]`, or simply assume `[Ring α]`.

",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We work in an arbitrary group G.
- The theorem takes parameters `{x : G} {n : ℕ}` and an assumption `(hn : orderOf x = n)`, and a subgroup `H : Subgroup G`.
- The left-hand side `(H ≠ ⊤ ∧ ∀ K : Subgroup G, H ≤ K → (K = H ∨ K = ⊤))` states that H is a maximal proper subgroup of G: H is proper and any subgroup K containing H is either H or the whole group ⊤.
- The right-hand side `∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ∣ n ∧ H = Subgroup.closure ({x ^ p} : Set G)` states that there exists a prime p dividing n such that H equals the subgroup generated by x^p (i.e., ⟨x^p⟩).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement assumes: G = ⟨x⟩ is a cyclic group of order n ≥ 1. This means (i) x generates the entire group, i.e. `Subgroup.closure {x} = ⊤`, and (ii) the order of G (and of x) is n, with n ≥ 1.
- The Lean statement only assumes `orderOf x = n`. It does not assume that x generates the whole group (i.e., it does not assert `Subgroup.closure {x} = ⊤`). Thus the global hypothesis “G is cyclic generated by x” is missing. As stated, it attempts to characterize maximal subgroups of an arbitrary group containing an element of (possibly finite) order n, which is not the intended content and is generally false.
- The Lean statement also does not enforce `n ≥ 1` or even finiteness of the order: in Mathlib, `orderOf x = 0` means x has infinite order. The original statement requires a finite order n ≥ 1. The code allows `n = 0` via `orderOf x = n` with no restriction, which mismatches the intended finiteness.
- The expression of maximality is otherwise standard and correct, and the identification `Subgroup.closure ({x ^ p} : Set G)` with ⟨x^p⟩ is faithful.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean code omits the crucial hypothesis that G is cyclic generated by x (G = ⊤ subgroup generated by x). It also omits the constraint n ≥ 1 (or at least n ≠ 0). Therefore, the formal statement is a significant generalization/misstatement and does not faithfully represent the original theorem.

  • G is a finite group.
  • p is a natural number with hp: p is prime.
  • α is a natural number with α > 0.
  • The order of G is p^α (hcard: Fintype.card G = p ^ α).
  • H is a subgroup of G with index p (hindex: H.index = p).
  • Conclusion: For all g and x in G, x ∈ H if and only if g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H.

Assessment of meaning:
- The conclusion ∀ g x, x ∈ H ↔ g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H is exactly the standard characterization of H being normal in G (invariance under conjugation by every g ∈ G). Thus the statement “H is normal” holds.
- Since H was arbitrary subject to the hypothesis H.index = p, the theorem asserts: every subgroup of index p in G is normal.
- The additional hypotheses (G finite of order p^α with α > 0 and p prime) match the natural language: G is a p-group of order p^α with α ∈ ℤ⁺.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem with an omitted proof (acceptable per instructions).

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: If p is prime and |G| = p^α with α > 0, then every subgroup of index p is normal.
- Lean: Under the same conditions, for an arbitrary subgroup H of index p, H is normal (expressed via the conjugation-invariance equivalence). This is faithful and equivalent.
- No scope mismatch or extra/unnecessary restrictions beyond what the natural language states. The bidirectional ↔ is equivalent to normality.

- The original says: “Prove that any subring of a field which contains the identity is an integral domain.” The Lean statement quantifies over a field K, a subring S of K, assumes `(1 : K) ∈ S` (i.e., contains the identity of the field), and concludes `IsDomain (↥S)` (S is an integral domain). This matches exactly.
- In Mathlib, `Subring` already contains `1` by definition, so `h1` is redundant in this library context, but including it aligns with the natural language phrasing that explicitly requires containing the identity. This redundancy does not harm faithfulness; it is consistent with the statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical content. No differences affecting meaning. If anything, the Lean version is slightly more explicit by taking `1 ∈ S` as a hypothesis.

  Natural language paraphrase: For a group G and a subgroup H, if H has finite index, then there exists a subgroup K with K ≤ H, and (again) K ≤ H, and the index of the normal core of H is at most factorial of the index of H.

Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: If H has finite index n, there exists a normal subgroup K of G with K ≤ H and |G:K| ≤ n!.
- Issues in the Lean statement:
  1) Missing normality of K. The existential does not assert K is normal.
  2) The inequality is stated for (Subgroup.normalCore H).Index, not for the index of the existentially-quantified K. Thus the K shown by the existential is completely unrelated to the bound.
  3) Redundant hypothesis: The existential is written as ∃ K ≤ H, (K ≤ H) ∧ ..., which duplicates K ≤ H and makes the existential effectively trivial; since Q := ((Subgroup.normalCore H).Index ≤ Nat.factorial H.index) does not depend on K, the statement is logically equivalent to H.FiniteIndex → Q, because there always exists some K ≤ H (e.g., K = ⊥). So the lemma really asserts only the bound on the index of normalCore H.
  4) The original requires existence of a normal K ≤ H with the bound on |G:K|. The code does not state the existence of a normal subgroup, nor does it bind the bound to the K in the existential. While it mentions normalCore H implicitly (which is normal and ≤ H by mathlib facts), the statement itself does not assert “there exists a normal K” nor does it conclude anything about the K it quantifies over.
  5) Minor technical note: It uses H.index and Nat.factorial H.index as the n!, which matches the intended n. However, the code writes (Subgroup.normalCore H).Index with a capital I; in mathlib the usual is .index (lowercase). If this compiles, fine; but it is suspicious.

Overall conclusion:
- The code does not faithfully match the natural statement. It neither quantifies the normality of K nor ties the bound to K; it effectively proves a different claim (a bound on the index of normalCore H), from which the original existence statement could be derived as a corollary by choosing K = normalCore H, but that is not what the lemma states. Hence it is not a faithful translation.

- The definitions and assumptions match exactly: A ⊆ ℝ, nonempty, bounded below. The set −A is represented as the image under negation. The equality is exactly inf A = − sup(−A).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ℤ[x₁, x₂, x₃, …] / (x₁x₂, x₃x₄, x₅x₆, …) has infinitely many minimal prime ideals.
- The code models exactly this ring as a quotient of a countable-variable polynomial ring over ℤ by the ideal generated by pairwise products of consecutive variables. The only minor difference is indexing: the code uses variables indexed by ℕ starting at 0 and generators X_{2k}·X_{2k+1} for k = 0,1,2,…, i.e., (x₀x₁, x₂x₃, x₄x₅, …). This is a harmless reindexing equivalent to (x₁x₂, x₃x₄, x₅x₆, …). The definition of minimal primes in the quotient ring matches the usual notion. The final theorem asserts the set of minimal primes is infinite, aligning with the natural statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only difference is the indexing shift (0-based in code vs. 1-based in the statement). This is a benign reindexing and does not change the mathematical content. All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders), and the theorem statement is exactly the claim of infinite minimal prime ideals of the quotient ring.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: G is a finite group with |G| = 56.
- Conclusion: There exists a prime p with p ∣ 56 and a subgroup P ≤ G, together with a finite structure on P, such that:
  - There exists k ∈ ℕ with |P| = p^k (i.e., P is a p-group), and
  - For all g ∈ G and x ∈ P, we have g x g⁻¹ ∈ P (i.e., P is closed under conjugation by all elements of G, hence normal).

So the theorem asserts: There exists a prime p dividing 56 and a normal p-subgroup P of G (with no requirement that P be of maximal possible p-power order).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: In a group of order 56, there exists a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order. That is, there exists p ∣ |G| and a subgroup P which is a Sylow p-subgroup (i.e., |P| = p^n where p^n is the highest power of p dividing |G|) and P is normal in G.

3) Differences:
- The Lean statement only asserts the existence of a normal p-subgroup, not necessarily a Sylow p-subgroup. It includes the condition |P| = p^k for some k, but does not require k to be maximal (i.e., equal to the p-adic valuation of |G|). This is a significant weakening.
- The Lean statement even allows k = 0, so P could be the trivial subgroup, which is normal in any group. Thus the statement would be trivially true regardless of the group structure and does not use |G| = 56 in any meaningful way.
- The use of p ∣ 56 instead of p ∣ |G| is acceptable here because the hypothesis |G| = 56 is present, but the main issue remains the missing Sylow condition.
- The normality condition is correctly expressed via closure under conjugation (and since it holds for all g, it implies equality gPg⁻¹ = P), so that part is fine.

Conclusion: The code does not faithfully formalize the claim about a normal Sylow p-subgroup; it only claims existence of a normal p-subgroup, which is much weaker and can be trivial. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language claim is: convergence of {s_n} implies convergence of {|s_n|}. The Lean statement assumes s converges to L and concludes that |s| converges to |L|, which is the standard precise formulation of the claim. It is a faithful and slightly more explicit version.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Lean restricts to real sequences, which matches the typical context of the statement (absolute value on ℝ). The natural statement did not specify domain but usually means real sequences; even if broader (e.g., complex), the real case is a standard specialization and acceptable per guidelines.
- Explicit limit: Lean specifies the limit of |s_n| is |L|; the natural language statement implicitly means this. This is a faithful sharpening, not a discrepancy.

  This states: For complex numbers `x` and `y`, the absolute value of the difference of their norms is less than or equal to the norm of their difference. In Lean, `Norm.norm` on `Complex` is the usual complex modulus ‖·‖, and `abs` here is the real absolute value on ℝ (since `Norm.norm x - Norm.norm y` is a real number). Thus the statement is `|‖x‖ - ‖y‖| ≤ ‖x - y‖`.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language claim is: If x, y are complex, prove that ||x|-|y|| ≤ |x-y|. Interpreting inner |·| as the complex modulus and the outer |·| as the real absolute value, this matches exactly the Lean statement `abs (Norm.norm x - Norm.norm y) ≤ Norm.norm (x - y)`.

The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement is given. The usage of `Norm.norm` for the complex modulus and `abs` for the real absolute value is standard in Mathlib and matches the intended meaning. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_8_2_4 {R : Type _} [Semiring R] [IsDomain R] ... : IsPrincipalIdealRing R := by sorry`
  Interprets as: Let R be a type with a semiring structure and assume R is a (Lean) domain (no zero divisors and 0 ≠ 1). Under hypotheses (h_gcd) and (h_stab) below, conclude that R is a principal ideal ring (every ideal is principal). Since [IsDomain R] is assumed, this corresponds to R being a principal ideal domain in the usual sense.

- `(h_gcd : ∀ a b : R, a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → ∃ d : R, d ∣ a ∧ d ∣ b ∧ (∀ e, e ∣ a → e ∣ b → e ∣ d) ∧ (∃ r s : R, d = r * a + s * b))`
  This says: For any nonzero a, b in R there exists d in R such that d divides a, d divides b, and for every common divisor e of a and b, e divides d; moreover d can be written as d = r a + s b for some r, s in R. This is exactly: any two nonzero elements have a greatest common divisor (in the divisibility order) that satisfies a Bézout identity.

- `(h_stab : ∀ (a : ℕ → R), (∀ i, a (i+1) ∣ a i) → ∃ N, ∀ n, n ≥ N → ∃ u : R, IsUnit u ∧ a n = u * a N)`
  This says: For any sequence a: ℕ → R with a_{i+1} dividing a_i for all i, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N there is a unit u with a_n = u * a_N; i.e., the sequence stabilizes up to multiplication by a unit.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement assumes R is an integral domain. In Lean, this is represented by `[IsDomain R]`. The code only assumes `[Semiring R]` rather than `[CommRing R]`, but in mathlib `IsDomain` is the standard typeclass for a (possibly more general) domain-like structure; this is a routine formalization choice and acceptable.
- Condition (i) in natural language matches `h_gcd` exactly: existence of a gcd of nonzero a, b that is a linear combination r a + s b.
- Condition (ii) in natural language requires a sequence of nonzero elements a₁, a₂, ... with a_{i+1} | a_i stabilizes up to units. The code's `h_stab` requires the stabilization property for all sequences (not necessarily nonzero). This is a stronger hypothesis than the natural language assumption. It's a slight specialization/strengthening of the hypothesis, not a weakening or a change in conclusion.
- The conclusion in natural language is that R is a Principal Ideal Domain. The code concludes `IsPrincipalIdealRing R`; together with the standing hypothesis `[IsDomain R]`, this matches the intended notion of PID.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Main difference: The code omits the requirement that each term in the sequence in (ii) be nonzero; it assumes stabilization for all sequences with divisibility. This is a stronger assumption than required in the problem statement. As a translation of the exercise, this is a slight specialization of the hypothesis, but the mathematical meaning and structure of the result are preserved.
- Minor technical difference: The code works with `[Semiring R] [IsDomain R]` rather than explicitly requiring a commutative ring; in mathlib this is a standard generalization for domains and is acceptable for faithful translation purposes.
- Indexing and phrasing (e.g., ℕ starting at 0, “positive integer N” vs natural number N) are harmless formalization details.

Given these points, the code is essentially faithful to the statement, with the only notable deviation being the stronger hypothesis in (ii). This is a slight specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.

- The mathematical content matches exactly, except for the acceptable generalization from metric spaces to topological spaces. There are no discrepancies in the statement itself.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators`: bring in Mathlib and notation for big sums/products.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_6a : ∀ M : ℝ, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ N → (Finset.sum (Finset.range n) (fun i => Real.sqrt (i + 1) - Real.sqrt i)) ≥ M := by sorry`
  This asserts: For every real number M, there exists a natural number N such that for all natural numbers n ≥ N, the finite sum over i from 0 to n−1 of (√(i+1) − √i) is at least M. Here `Finset.range n` indexes {0, 1, ..., n−1}, matching “i < n”, and `Real.sqrt (i + 1)` implicitly coerces the natural `i + 1` to a real as needed.

Assessment relative to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: “Prove that lim_{n → ∞} ∑_{i < n} a_i = ∞, where a_i = √(i + 1) − √i.”
- The Lean theorem expresses exactly the definition of divergence to +∞ for the sequence of partial sums: ∀M ∃N ∀n ≥ N, S_n ≥ M, where S_n = ∑_{i < n} (√(i+1) − √i). This is equivalent to saying the limit is +∞.
- The summand matches `a_i = √(i+1) − √i`. The indexing `i < n` matches `Finset.range n`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is a direct formalization of the claim.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same: the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the divergence to +∞ of the sequence of partial sums defined by the given `a_i`.
- No discrepancies found.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `Dummit_Foote_exercise_8_3_6b` and takes a natural number `q : ℕ` with hypotheses `hq : q.Prime` and `hmod : q % 4 = 3` (i.e., q is a prime and congruent to 3 modulo 4).
- The conclusion is a conjunction of three statements about the quotient ring `GaussianInt ⧸ Ideal.span ({(q : GaussianInt)} : Set GaussianInt)`:
  1) `IsField (...)` — the quotient ring ℤ[i]/(q) is a field.
  2) `Nonempty (Fintype (...))` — there exists a finite type structure on this quotient, i.e., it is a finite ring.
  3) `∀ [Fintype (...)], Fintype.card (...) = q * q` — for any choice of finite type structure on the quotient (Fintype instances are propositionally unique anyway), the cardinality is `q * q` (i.e., q²).
- The ideal `Ideal.span ({(q : GaussianInt)} : Set GaussianInt)` is the principal ideal (q) in ℤ[i]. Thus the quotient is exactly ℤ[i]/(q).
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is elided with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing. No placeholders are used for concepts: `IsField`, `GaussianInt`, `Ideal.span`, `Quotient`, and `Fintype` are all standard Mathlib notions.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: Let q ∈ ℤ be a prime with q ≡ 3 (mod 4). Prove ℤ[i]/(q) is a field with q² elements.
- Code uses `q : ℕ` rather than `q : ℤ`, but this is a standard and harmless specialization since a “prime integer” is usually taken to be a positive prime; and `q % 4 = 3` in ℕ is the natural encoding of q ≡ 3 mod 4.
- The field claim is captured by `IsField` of the quotient.
- “With q² elements” is captured by the existence of a `Fintype` structure and the fact that for any such structure the cardinal is `q*q`. Together these say the quotient has exactly q² elements.
- The ideal `(q)` in ℤ[i] is modeled faithfully by `Ideal.span {q}` with `q` coerced to `GaussianInt`.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement precisely expresses the ring is a field and has cardinality q², under the stated modular condition on a prime q. The only minor change is `q : ℕ` instead of `q : ℤ`, which is an acceptable specialization and does not change the mathematical content.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are legitimate Mathlib constructs. The theorem is stated without proof (via `sorry`), which is allowed for translation checking.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful to the original statement.

  - Let X be a type with a metric space structure and complete (i.e., a complete metric space), and assume X is nonempty.
  - Let G be a sequence of subsets of X indexed by natural numbers, G : ℕ → Set X.
  - Assume for each n, G n is open and dense in X.
  - Then the intersection over all n ∈ ℕ of G n is not the empty set.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: X is a nonempty complete metric space; {G_n} is a sequence of dense open sets; conclude that the intersection ⋂_{n=1}^∞ G_n is nonempty (Baire's theorem).
- Lean statement exactly assumes: X is a nonempty complete metric space, each G n is open and dense, and concludes that ⋂_{n∈ℕ} G n is nonempty (formulated as not equal to ∅).
- The only indexing difference is that Lean uses ℕ (starting at 0) instead of {1,2,...}. This is a harmless reindexing; one can define H(n) = G(n+1) to match the 1-based indexing. Both represent a countable sequence of dense open sets. The conclusion ""nonempty intersection"" matches the natural language ""is not empty"" (Set.Nonempty is equivalent to ≠ ∅ in this context).

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts. The theorem states exactly the nonemptiness (not density) of the countable intersection, which is precisely what the natural language requests. The 0 vs 1 starting index is a standard and acceptable technical variation and does not alter the theorem's meaning.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_19 {k : ℕ} (a b : Fin k → ℝ) :` sets the context: for any natural number k, and vectors a, b in ℝ^k (represented as functions `Fin k → ℝ`).
- `∃ (c : Fin k → ℝ) (r : ℝ), r > 0 ∧` asserts the existence of a center c ∈ ℝ^k and a radius r > 0.
- `(∀ x : Fin k → ℝ, dist x a = 2 * dist x b ↔ dist x c = r) ∧` says that for all x ∈ ℝ^k, the condition |x − a| = 2|x − b| is equivalent to |x − c| = r. Here `dist x y` is the metric distance, which in ℝ^k is ‖x − y‖, matching the absolute-value bars in the natural language.
- `3 • c = 4 • b - a ∧` asserts the linear relation 3c = 4b − a (• is scalar multiplication).
- `3 * r = 2 * ‖b - a‖` asserts the relation 3r = 2‖b − a‖.
- The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; per the instructions we only assess the statement/translation, not the proof.

Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Natural: Given a, b ∈ ℝ^k, find c ∈ ℝ^k and r > 0 such that |x − a| = 2|x − b| iff |x − c| = r, and prove 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2|b − a|.
- Lean: Exactly asserts existence of such c and r > 0, the pointwise equivalence for all x, and the two identities relating c and r to a and b.

Checks and potential discrepancies:
- Representation of ℝ^k as `Fin k → ℝ` is standard in Mathlib; distances and norms are the Euclidean ones, so |·| corresponds to `‖·‖` and `dist x y = ‖x − y‖`.
- The universal quantification over x aligns with “if and only if” for all x.
- The relations 3•c = 4•b − a and 3*r = 2*‖b − a‖ match 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2|b − a|.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Slight technicality: the theorem is stated for all k : ℕ, which includes k = 0. In typical mathematical context, ℝ^k assumes k ≥ 1; however, this is a standard implicit assumption and the formal statement being for all k is a harmless generalization for the purpose of translation. It does not change the intended meaning of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language problem, matching all components (existence of c and r > 0, the equivalence condition, and the two identities).

  Natural language: Let a, b be real sequences. Assume the series Σ a_n is summable (convergent). Assume b is monotone nondecreasing (Monotone b) and bounded in absolute value (equivalently, bounded). Then the series Σ (a_n b_n) is summable (convergent). The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per instructions since we are only checking the statement.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
Original: If Σ a_n converges and {b_n} is monotonic and bounded, then Σ a_n b_n converges. This is Abel's test. The Lean statement matches this, with b: ℕ → ℝ monotone (specifically nondecreasing) and bounded (expressed as |b n| ≤ M). Conclusion matches: Summable (fun n => a n * b n).

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Domain: The Lean code uses real sequences; the natural statement does not specify the field, but ℝ is a standard setting and fully faithful contextually.
- Monotonicity: The natural phrase ""monotonic"" typically allows either nonincreasing or nondecreasing. The Lean code assumes Monotone (nondecreasing) specifically. This is a slight specialization. In practice, the nonincreasing case can be reduced by considering −b, but as stated, the Lean theorem directly covers only the nondecreasing case.
- Boundedness: The Lean code uses an absolute bound |b n| ≤ M, which is equivalent to b being bounded in the usual sense for real sequences.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with hypotheses exactly matching Abel's test (up to the monotonicity direction). This is a faithful formalization with a minor specialization regarding the direction of monotonicity.

  Natural language: Let X and Y be topological spaces, f : X → Y a continuous function, and E ⊆ X a dense subset. Then the closure of f(E) equals the closure of f(univ), i.e., the closure of f(X).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: Let f and g be continuous mappings of a metric space X into a metric space Y, and let E be a dense subset of X. Prove that f(E) is dense in f(X).
- The Lean theorem assumes only topological spaces (a slight generalization beyond metric spaces) and uses only f; the mention of g in the natural language is extraneous to this claim.
- The conclusion closure(f''E) = closure(f''univ) is equivalent to “f(E) is dense in f(X)”: since f(E) ⊆ f(X), we always have closure(f(E)) ⊆ closure(f(X)); conversely, if f(E) is dense in f(X), then f(X) ⊆ closure(f(E)), hence closure(f(X)) ⊆ closure(f(E)); together these give equality. Therefore the Lean statement is exactly the density statement, even slightly stronger in form.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same mathematical content: Yes. The Lean statement is an equivalent reformulation (equality of closures) of “f(E) is dense in f(X)”.
- Generality: Lean uses topological spaces instead of metric spaces, which is a benign generalization allowed by the guidelines.
- Extra symbol g in the natural language is unused and irrelevant; its omission in Lean is appropriate for this part.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions; only standard Mathlib notions are used. The presence of 'sorry' is acceptable per instructions; we audit the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- import Mathlib; open Real: Brings in standard mathematics library and real number operations, including sqrt.
- def s : ℕ → ℝ | 0 => sqrt 2 | n+1 => sqrt (2 + sqrt (s n)): Defines a real sequence s indexed by natural numbers with s 0 = √2 and the recursion s (n+1) = √(2 + √(s n)). This is the same recurrence as in the statement, but with indexing starting at 0 instead of 1.
- theorem s_lt_two (n : ℕ) : s n < 2 := ...: States that for every natural number n, s n < 2. This corresponds to the claim s_n < 2 for all n, with the minor difference that here n starts at 0 rather than 1. It's a slightly stronger claim but consistent with the original.
- theorem s_converges : Tendsto s atTop (𝓝 (2 : ℝ)) := ...: States that the sequence s converges to 2. This is stronger than merely saying it converges; it identifies the limit. The proof is omitted (sorry), but per the instructions we only check the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful to the original?
- The original sequence: s_1 = √2, s_{n+1} = √(2 + √(s_n)) for n ≥ 1.
- The code’s sequence: s 0 = √2, s (n+1) = √(2 + √(s n)) for n ≥ 0.
  This is a standard reindexing: s_code(n) = s_original(n+1). The properties being proved (s_n < 2 and convergence) are invariant under this shift, and in fact s_lt_two proves a slightly stronger statement (including n = 0). Hence the definition is faithful up to harmless reindexing.
- The theorem s_lt_two matches the requirement s_n < 2 for all n ≥ 1 in the original; the code proves it for all n ≥ 0, which implies the original claim.
- The convergence claim in the original is that the sequence converges (limit not explicitly requested). The code asserts it converges to 2, which is a strengthening but completely consistent and acceptable.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing shift: original starts at n=1, code at n=0. This is a benign reindexing and preserves the mathematical content.
- Strengthening: code asserts the limit is 2, while the original only asks to prove convergence. This is acceptable as a slight strengthening.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the sequence is properly defined; no fake predicates. The presence of sorry in a proof is acceptable under the audit instructions, since we are assessing the statement translation, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully models the natural language statement (with a harmless index shift and a slight strengthening on the limit).

1) Line-by-line translation
- `def R (n : ℕ) := AdjoinRoot (X ^ 2 + C (n : ℤ))`:
  This defines the ring R as Z adjoined with a root of the polynomial X^2 + n; equivalently, R ≅ ℤ[X]/(X^2 + n). In this ring, the distinguished element `AdjoinRoot.root (X^2 + C (n : ℤ))` (call it α) satisfies α^2 = -n. This models ℤ[√(-n)].

- The theorem statement:
  Assumptions: `n : ℕ`, `Squarefree n`, and `3 < n` (so n is a squarefree integer greater than 3). The conclusions are a conjunction of three irreducibility statements in the ring `AdjoinRoot (X ^ 2 + C (n : ℤ))`:
  • `Irreducible (AdjoinRoot.mk (X ^ 2 + C (n : ℤ)) (C (2 : ℤ)))` means the element represented by the constant polynomial 2 is irreducible; this is just the element 2 in R.
  • `Irreducible (AdjoinRoot.root (X ^ 2 + C (n : ℤ)))` states the adjoined root α (i.e., √(-n)) is irreducible.
  • `Irreducible (AdjoinRoot.mk (X ^ 2 + C (n : ℤ)) (C (1 : ℤ)) + AdjoinRoot.root (X ^ 2 + C (n : ℤ)))` states 1 + α (i.e., 1 + √(-n)) is irreducible.

Here `AdjoinRoot.mk (X^2 + C n)` is the natural quotient map from ℤ[X] to the quotient ring, so `AdjoinRoot.mk ... (C 2)` is the image of 2 in R, and `AdjoinRoot.root ...` is the class of X (the adjoined root).

2) Faithfulness assessment
- The natural language asks to prove: In R = ℤ[√(-n)] with n squarefree and > 3, the elements 2, √(-n), and 1 + √(-n) are irreducible.
- The Lean code models R as AdjoinRoot(X^2 + n) over ℤ, which is standard and equivalent to adjoining √(-n). The three elements in the statement correspond exactly to 2, the root α = √(-n), and 1 + α. The hypotheses match: n is a natural number, squarefree, and greater than 3. This matches “squarefree integer greater than 3” (a positive integer), so the conditions align.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `R` is a legitimate construction. The theorem statements are legitimate irreducibility claims in the correct ring. There are no extraneous or contradictory components.

3) Final comparison
- Differences: The code uses n : ℕ rather than an arbitrary integer, but the natural language assumes n > 3, so n is positive; this is a harmless specialization entirely consistent with the original statement. The ring is expressed via AdjoinRoot of X^2 + n rather than explicitly ℤ[√(-n)], but these are canonically isomorphic. The elements named are exactly 2, √(-n), and 1 + √(-n). Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language proposition.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  • `(f : {x // x ∈ E} → ℝ)`: f is a function whose domain is the subtype `{x // x ∈ E}` (i.e., a function defined on E) and codomain ℝ.
  • `(hf : Continuous f)`: f is continuous with respect to the subtype topology on E and the standard topology on ℝ. This matches “f is a real continuous function defined on E.”
  • Conclusion: `∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g ∧ ∀ x : {x // x ∈ E}, g x.val = f x`. There exists a function g: ℝ → ℝ, continuous on ℝ, such that for every element `x` of the subtype (i.e., every point of E), evaluating g at the underlying real `x.val` equals `f x`. This is exactly the statement that g agrees with f on E.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: given a continuous f defined on a closed set E ⊂ ℝ, there exists a continuous g on ℝ with g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E. The Lean statement models f as a function on the subtype `{x // x ∈ E}` with continuity, assumes E is closed, and asserts the existence of a continuous extension g on ℝ that agrees with f on E. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The use of the subtype `{x // x ∈ E}` and the equation `g x.val = f x` is the standard Lean way to express “g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No unintended strengthening or weakening: the statement is exactly the Tietze extension property for ℝ with closed E.

Therefore, the code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- Docstring: ""The polynomial X^2 - √2 is irreducible over Z[√2] = AdjoinRoot (X^2 - 2)"" describes the intended statement.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_9` states: `Irreducible (Polynomial.X ^ 2 - Polynomial.C (AdjoinRoot.root (Polynomial.X ^ 2 - 2 : Polynomial Int)) : Polynomial (AdjoinRoot (Polynomial.X ^ 2 - 2 : Polynomial Int)))`.
  • The coefficient ring is `AdjoinRoot (Polynomial.X ^ 2 - 2 : Polynomial Int)`, which is the standard Mathlib construction of adjoining a root of `X^2 - 2` to ℤ, i.e., a canonical model of ℤ[√2].
  • `AdjoinRoot.root (X^2 - 2)` denotes the distinguished element √2 in this ring.
  • `Polynomial.C` embeds that element as a constant polynomial.
  • The polynomial under consideration is thus `X^2 - √2` with coefficients in `AdjoinRoot (X^2 - 2) ≅ ℤ[√2]`.
  • The conclusion `Irreducible ...` is the assertion that this polynomial is irreducible over that coefficient ring.
  • The proof is left as `sorry`, but the task only concerns the faithfulness of the statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Prove that the polynomial x^2 − √2 is irreducible over ℤ[√2], allowing the assumption that ℤ[√2] is a UFD for the proof.
- Lean: Asserts irreducibility of X^2 − √2 over `AdjoinRoot (X^2 − 2 : Polynomial Int)`, which is canonically ℤ[√2]. The exact polynomial and coefficient ring match, with √2 represented by the canonical root in the adjoined ring.
- The UFD assumption is for the proof and does not need to appear in the statement; its absence in the statement is appropriate.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
- Yes. The coefficient ring is the standard formalization of ℤ[√2]. The polynomial is exactly x^2 − √2 in that ring. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is a faithful formal counterpart of the natural language claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_20 {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] {p : ℕ → X} (hp : CauchySeq p)` introduces a metric space X and a sequence p : ℕ → X that is Cauchy.
- `{s : ℕ → ℕ} (hs : StrictMono s)` introduces an indexing function s that is strictly increasing, i.e., it picks a subsequence of p.
- `{a : X}` introduces a point a in X.
- `(hconv : Filter.Tendsto (p ∘ s) Filter.atTop (nhds a))` states that the subsequence p ∘ s converges to a.
- Conclusion: `Filter.Tendsto p Filter.atTop (nhds a)` states that the full sequence p converges to a.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Natural language: In a metric space X, if {p_n} is Cauchy and there exists a subsequence {p_{n_l}} converging to p ∈ X, then the whole sequence converges to p.
- Lean: Assumes p is Cauchy, assumes existence of a strictly increasing s giving a subsequence p ∘ s that converges to a, and concludes p converges to a. This matches exactly: subsequence via StrictMono s is standard; convergence expressed via `Tendsto ... (nhds a)`; the limit point is denoted `a` instead of `p`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code uses standard Mathlib notions (MetricSpace, CauchySeq, StrictMono for subsequence, Filter.Tendsto for convergence). No auxiliary or vacuous definitions. No change in generality or content. The use of strictly increasing for subsequences aligns with standard definitions.
- Only cosmetic differences: naming (`a` vs `p` for the limit). Otherwise, the mathematical statements are the same.

- `Continuous f` means f is continuous on E with the subspace topology (this is exactly the usual meaning of “f is continuous on E”).
- `IsCompact ((fun x : Subtype E => (x.val, f x)) '' (Set.univ : Set (Subtype E)))` states that the image of all points of E under the map x ↦ (x, f x) is compact in ℝ × ℝ. Here `x.val` is the underlying real number of the subtype element x ∈ E. The set `((fun x => (x.val, f x)) '' Set.univ)` is exactly the graph of f as a subset of the plane.
- The equivalence `↔` asserts: f is continuous on E if and only if its graph is compact.

Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement: E is a compact subset of ℝ, f: E → ℝ, the graph is {(x, f(x)) | x ∈ E} ⊆ ℝ², and prove f is continuous on E iff its graph is compact. 
- The Lean code uses `Subtype E` to represent the domain E, defines the graph as the image of `Set.univ` under x ↦ (x.val, f x), and asserts the equivalence between continuity and compactness of the graph. This matches exactly.

Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; no auxiliary definitions are present.
- The topology and compactness notions are those of Mathlib for ℝ and ℝ × ℝ.

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_2_24 {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]`: X is an arbitrary type equipped with a MetricSpace structure.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ s : Set X, s.Infinite → ∃ x, x ∈ closure (s \ {x})`: For every subset s of X, if s is infinite, then there exists a point x in X such that x belongs to the closure of s without x. In a metric (indeed, topological) space, `x ∈ closure (s \ {x})` means every neighborhood of x meets s at some point different from x, i.e., x is a limit (accumulation) point of s. This matches the natural language assumption that every infinite subset has a limit point (not necessarily in s itself, which is standard).
- Conclusion: `∃ S : Set X, Set.Countable S ∧ Dense S`: There exists a subset S of X that is countable and dense, which is exactly the definition of separability.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; allowed for our translation audit, as we only check statement faithfulness.

Whole-statement comparison:
- The Lean hypothesis precisely formalizes “every infinite subset has a limit point.” The use of `closure (s \ {x})` is the standard formalization of “x is a limit point of s.”

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical content.

- Hypothesis hf: ∀ a b c, a < b → f a < c → c < f b → ∃ x, a < x ∧ x < b ∧ f x = c
  This says: For all real numbers a, b, c, if a < b and f(a) < c < f(b), then there exists x with a < x < b such that f(x) = c. This is the intermediate value property in the strict form for the case a < b and c strictly between f(a) and f(b).
- Hypothesis h_closed: ∀ r : ℚ, IsClosed {x | f x = r}
  For every rational r, the set of all real x such that f(x) = r is closed (as a subset of ℝ with the standard topology). The notation {x | f x = r} implicitly coerces r : ℚ to (r : ℝ), so this is precisely “the level set at the rational value r is closed.”
- Conclusion: Continuous f
  The function f is continuous on ℝ.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language states f: ℝ → ℝ has the intermediate value property: if f(a) < c < f(b), then there exists an x between a and b with f(x) = c. The code’s hf assumes a < b explicitly and requires a strict between-ness a < x < b. This is the standard formalization of “x between a and b.” The natural language statement also uses strict inequalities, so this matches.
- The natural language did not explicitly state a < b, but “between a and b” is typically interpreted as the open interval between the two, which in formalization is captured by assuming a < b and concluding a < x < b. This is standard and faithful.
- The second hypothesis matches exactly: for every rational r, the level set {x | f(x) = r} is closed.
- The conclusion “f is continuous” corresponds to Mathlib’s Continuous f.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts, and the theorem statement is left with a proof hole (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only subtlety is that hf assumes a < b, whereas the natural language did not explicitly specify an ordering on a and b; however, this is a conventional formalization of “between” and faithfully captures the intended IVP as stated with strict inequalities f(a) < c < f(b). There is no substantive mismatch.
- The use of rationals ℚ in the closedness assumption matches the natural language precisely.
- The conclusion of continuity is global, matching the statement “f is continuous.”

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language problem with standard, acceptable formal details.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem midpoint_convex_continuous_implies_convex_on {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hab : a < b)` introduces real numbers a, b and a real-valued function f on ℝ, with the assumption a < b.
- `(hcont : ContinuousOn f (Set.Ioo a b))` assumes f is continuous on the open interval (a, b) (as a function from ℝ restricted to that set).
- `(hmid : ∀ x y, x ∈ Set.Ioo a b → y ∈ Set.Ioo a b → f ((x + y) / 2) ≤ (f x + f y) / 2)` assumes the midpoint convexity inequality holds for all x, y in (a, b).
- `: ConvexOn ℝ (Set.Ioo a b) f` concludes that f is convex on the open interval (a, b), i.e., for all x, y in (a, b) and t in [0,1], f((1−t)x + t y) ≤ (1−t) f x + t f y.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but we are auditing only the statement/translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""Assume that f is a continuous real function defined in (a, b) such that f((x+y)/2) ≤ (f(x)+f(y))/2 for all x, y in (a, b). Prove that f is convex."" The Lean statement matches this: continuity on (a,b), midpoint inequality on (a,b), and conclusion that f is convex on (a,b) (expressed as `ConvexOn ℝ (Set.Ioo a b) f`). Using `f : ℝ → ℝ` with `ContinuousOn` on `(a,b)` faithfully models a function defined on (a,b) and continuous there.

3) Final check: Are there differences?
- The Lean code adds the extra assumption `a < b`. The natural language did not explicitly assume this. If a ≥ b, (a,b) is empty and convexity is vacuous, so the original statement would still be true; the Lean version is a slight specialization to nonempty intervals. This is a minor and acceptable technical strengthening in formalization.
- Everything else aligns: same midpoint convexity hypothesis, same continuity requirement, same conclusion of convexity on (a,b).

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. Therefore, the translation is faithful, with a negligible extra assumption.

Let E ⊆ ℝ be unbounded. There exists a real function f which is uniformly continuous on E and is unbounded on E.

We formulate unboundedness of E by: for every M there exists x ∈ E with |x| > M.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: States a version of Rudin Ex 4.8(b): If E ⊆ ℝ is unbounded, then there exists a real function f which is uniformly continuous on E and is unbounded on E.
- `variable {E : Set ℝ}`: Let E be a subset of ℝ.
- Theorem `exists_unif_continuous_unbounded_on_unbounded_set (hE : ∀ M : ℝ, ∃ x ∈ E, |x| > M) : ∃ f : ℝ → ℝ, UniformContinuousOn f E ∧ (∀ M : ℝ, ∃ x ∈ E, |f x| > M)`: Assuming E is unbounded in the sense that for every real M there exists x ∈ E with |x| > M, there exists a function f : ℝ → ℝ such that f is uniformly continuous on E and unbounded on E (i.e., for every M there exists x ∈ E with |f x| > M).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The given natural language statement: “Let E be a bounded set in R^1. Prove that there exists a real function f such that f is uniformly continuous and is not bounded on E.”
- The Lean code assumes E is unbounded, which is the exact opposite of the hypothesis (bounded) in the natural statement.
- The Lean code concludes existence of f uniformly continuous on E (UniformContinuousOn f E). The natural language statement is ambiguous, but typically “f is uniformly continuous” without qualification suggests uniform continuity on ℝ. Regardless of interpretation, the Lean version restricts uniform continuity to E, which is weaker than global uniform continuity.
- Therefore, there are two major mismatches: (i) bounded vs unbounded hypothesis on E, and (ii) scope of uniform continuity (on E only vs possibly on ℝ).

3) Final check:
- The two problems are not the same. The Lean code solves a different problem with the opposite assumption and a weaker uniform continuity requirement. There are no vacuous definitions here, but the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: G is a finite group ([Group G] and [Fintype G]), p is a prime number ([Fact (Nat.Prime p)]).
- P and H are subgroups of G.
- Assumptions:
  - hP_pgroup : IsPGroup p (↥P): the subgroup P (viewed as a group on its carrier) is a p-group.
  - hP_normal : ∀ g x, x ∈ P → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ P: P is normal in G (explicit conjugation-closed property).
- Conclusion:
  - IsPGroup p (↥(P ⊓ H)): the intersection P ∩ H is a p-group.
  - ∀ Q ≤ H, IsPGroup p Q → Q ≤ P ⊓ H: every p-subgroup Q of H is contained in P ∩ H.
Interpretation:
- The conclusion effectively encodes that P ∩ H is the largest p-subgroup of H (hence the unique Sylow p-subgroup of H in the finite setting), since it contains every p-subgroup of H and is itself a p-group.
Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original statement: P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup of G; for any subgroup H ≤ G, P ∩ H is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of H.
- Lean hypotheses differ critically: the code assumes only that P is a normal p-group, not that P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. This is a much weaker assumption and is insufficient; the conclusion is generally false without the Sylow condition. For example, in G ≅ C_p × C_p, a proper nontrivial normal p-subgroup P does not contain all p-subgroups.
- The conclusion in the Lean statement, while a correct way to express “P ∩ H is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of H,” is stated under insufficient hypotheses.
Auxiliary definitions and placeholders:
- There are no vacuous placeholder definitions; all terms used are from Mathlib (IsPGroup, Subgroup intersection, etc.). The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions. The issue is not with vacuity but with a mismatch in assumptions.
Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? No. The Lean code fails to assume that P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, only that it is a normal p-group, which is inadequate and changes the theorem substantially. Thus the translation is not faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It fixes a type X and an index type ι, and a family of topologies t : ι → TopologicalSpace X.
- The theorem states there exists a unique topology T on X such that:
  (1) For every i : ι and every U : Set X, if U is open in t i, then U is open in T. This means T contains (is finer than) each topology t i.
  (2) For any topology T' on X, if T' contains all the opens of each t i (i.e., for all i and U, IsOpen in t i implies IsOpen in T'), then every open in T is open in T'. This asserts that T is the smallest (coarsest) topology among those that contain all the t i.
- The quantifier ∃! (T : TopologicalSpace X), ... asserts existence and uniqueness of such a T.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace, IsOpen) are used. The proof is omitted via `by sorry`, which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: “Let T_α be a family of topologies on X. Show that there is a unique smallest topology on X containing all the collections T_α.”
- The code precisely formalizes this: existence (∃) of a topology T that contains all t i (condition (1)), and minimality (condition (2)) among all topologies containing all t i, plus uniqueness (∃!). This matches exactly the intended statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code treats T_α as a family t : ι → TopologicalSpace X, exactly as in the statement.
- “Contains” is formalized via preservation of IsOpen from each t i to T; minimality is expressed via the universal property with respect to any T'.
- Uniqueness is explicitly included via ∃!.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only a proof placeholder.
- There are no extraneous hypotheses or stronger/weaker claims.
Thus, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- def IsPerfect {α} [TopologicalSpace α] (p : Set α) : Prop := IsClosed p ∧ ∀ x, x ∈ p → x ∈ closure (p \ {x}): This defines “perfect set” in a topological space as a closed set with no isolated points: every point x of p is a limit point of p, expressed as x belonging to the closure of p without x.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The hypothesis hsep is exactly the separability condition (existence of a countable dense subset) for the metric space.
- The assumption hs : IsClosed s matches “every closed set”.
- The conclusion gives p and c with s = p ∪ c, p perfect (closed and all points are limit points), and c countable (“at most countable” in mathlib’s Countable includes finite and empty sets). The phrase “possibly empty” is allowed since the given IsPerfect notion makes ∅ perfect (closed and vacuously has no isolated points).
- Because s = p ∪ c, both p and c are automatically subsets of s; no elements can lie outside s, so this matches the intended decomposition “of s”.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: IsPerfect is a standard, faithful formalization.
- The theorem’s quantification and conditions match the natural language statement exactly. The slightly more formal presentation via an explicit separability witness is correct.
- No extra unintended generalizations or restrictions. The result is stated for arbitrary separable metric spaces and closed sets within them.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which contains the definition of `IsOpenMap` and topological structures.
- Comment: ""The projection maps from a product space are open maps."" This matches the natural language goal.
- `theorem prod_fst_is_open_map {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : IsOpenMap (Prod.fst : X × Y → X) := by sorry`
  - For arbitrary types `X, Y` equipped with topologies, this asserts that the first projection `Prod.fst : X × Y → X` is an open map.
  - `IsOpenMap` is Mathlib's standard predicate meaning: for every open set `U` in the domain, `f '' U` is open in the codomain. So this exactly formalizes the statement that π₁ is an open map.
- `theorem prod_snd_is_open_map {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : IsOpenMap (Prod.snd : X × Y → Y) := by sorry`
  - Similarly, this asserts that the second projection `Prod.snd : X × Y → Y` is an open map, i.e., π₂ is open.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language defines open maps and asks to show that the projections π₁ and π₂ from the product space are open. The Lean theorems assert precisely that `Prod.fst` and `Prod.snd` are `IsOpenMap` under topological structures on `X` and `Y`.
- `IsOpenMap` in Mathlib matches the given definition of open map (images of open sets are open).
- The product and projections correspond exactly to `X × Y`, `Prod.fst`, and `Prod.snd`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given, with proofs omitted as `sorry`, which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness per instructions.

Final check: The two math problems are the same. The Lean statements exactly capture “π₁: X × Y → X is an open map” and “π₂: X × Y → Y is an open map.” There are no mismatches or extraneous conditions.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem takes a real number a and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- Assumption h : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f (Ioi a) means f is C^2 (twice continuously differentiable) on the open interval (a, ∞).
- It introduces three real numbers M0, M1, M2.
- Assumption h0 : ∀ x, a < x → |f x| ≤ M0 says M0 is an upper bound for |f| on (a, ∞).
- Assumption h1 : ∀ x, a < x → |deriv f x| ≤ M1 says M1 is an upper bound for |f'| on (a, ∞).
- Assumption h2 : ∀ x, a < x → |deriv (deriv f) x| ≤ M2 says M2 is an upper bound for |f''| on (a, ∞) (using deriv twice to denote the second derivative, which is valid under the C^2 hypothesis).
- Conclusion: M1 ^ 2 ≤ 4 * M0 * M2.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Domain: (a, ∞) matches Ioi a; good.
- Differentiability: The natural statement requires “twice-differentiable.” The Lean code assumes ContDiffOn ℝ 2, which is stronger (C^2). This is a harmless strengthening if the rest matched.
- Key discrepancy: The natural statement defines M0, M1, M2 as the least upper bounds (suprema) of |f|, |f'|, |f''|. The Lean code only assumes M0, M1, M2 are some upper bounds; there is no requirement that they be the least upper bounds or equal to the suprema.
- Quantification: In the code, M0, M1, M2 are arbitrary reals satisfying the bounding inequalities, and the theorem asserts the inequality must hold for any such triple. This is a far stronger (and actually false) claim. For example, for f ≡ 0 on (a, ∞), h0,h1,h2 hold with M0=0, M2=0, and any M1≥0, but the inequality M1^2 ≤ 0 fails for M1>0. In contrast, the natural statement fixes M0, M1, M2 to be the specific least upper bounds (which in this example are all 0), and the inequality 0 ≤ 0 holds.

3) Final check: The two problems are different. The code does not encode the “least upper bound” requirement; instead it claims the inequality for any upper bounds, which is not faithful and in fact false. The strengthened differentiability is acceptable, but the missing supremum condition is a critical mismatch.

Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- The theorem `isConnected_iUnion_of_connected_seq {A : ℕ → Set X}`: Let A be a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of subsets of X.
- Hypothesis `h_conn : ∀ n, IsConnected (A n)`: Each A n is a connected subspace (in Mathlib, `IsConnected s` for a set s means s is nonempty and preconnected with the subspace topology).
- Hypothesis `h_ne : ∀ n, (A n ∩ A (n+1)).Nonempty`: Consecutive sets intersect nontrivially for all n.
- Conclusion `IsConnected (⋃ n, A n)`: The union over all n of A n is connected.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; irrelevant for checking translation.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
The natural language statement: A sequence {A_n} of connected subspaces of X with A_n ∩ A_{n+1} ≠ ∅ for all n implies that the union ⋃ A_n is connected. The Lean statement matches exactly: a sequence of subsets of X, each connected, with pairwise consecutive nonempty intersections, implies the union over n is connected.

Step 3: Final comparison and potential differences
- Indexing: Lean indexes by ℕ; the natural statement uses n implicitly as natural numbers, so this matches.
- Connectedness: Mathlib's `IsConnected (A n)` includes nonemptiness, while some conventions may allow the empty set to be called disconnected/connected depending on the text. Here, the hypothesis `(A n ∩ A (n+1)).Nonempty` ensures each A n is nonempty, so there is no mismatch.
- Union: Lean uses `⋃ n, A n`, which is the union of the family {A_n}. This matches the natural language union.
No discrepancies found.

- `def condensation_points {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] (E : Set X) : Set X := { x | ∀ r, r > 0 → ¬ Set.Countable (E ∩ ball x r) }`: In any metric space X, the condensation points of a set E are those points x such that every open ball around x meets E in an uncountable set. This matches the standard notion of condensation points in metric spaces.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_2_27a (k : ℕ) {E : Set (Rk k)} (hE : ¬ Set.Countable E) :` states: Given an uncountable subset E of R^k, the set of condensation points of E is closed, and for every point x in that set and every ε>0, there exists another point y in the set of condensation points with y ≠ x and dist(x,y) < ε. In other words, the set of condensation points has no isolated points.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: Given uncountable E ⊆ ℝ^k and P the set of condensation points of E, prove that P is perfect. In a metric space, a set is perfect iff it is closed and has no isolated points. The theorem asserts exactly these two properties for P = condensation_points E, under the hypothesis that E is uncountable. The definition of condensation points used (via balls) is equivalent to the usual neighborhood-based definition in metric spaces. The second conjunct in the theorem is precisely the metric formulation of “no isolated points.” Thus, the Lean statement matches the intended claim that P is perfect.

3) Final check for differences or red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: condensation_points is a genuine definition; Rk is a standard alias for ℝ^k; no fake predicates are introduced.
- Although Mathlib may have a `Perfect` predicate, the theorem states the equivalent properties directly (closed and no isolated points), which is acceptable and faithful.
- The assumption `¬ Set.Countable E` matches “E uncountable.”
- The conclusion exactly characterizes perfection in ℝ^k.
- Not requiring nonemptiness of P is fine because “perfect” does not include nonemptiness by definition, and the original statement only asks to prove that P is perfect.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

2) Overall faithfulness:
This matches exactly the natural language statement: a sequence in the product space converges to x iff each projected sequence under the coordinate projection π_α converges to π_α(x). The Lean statement uses the standard Filter.Tendsto formalization of convergence and the dependent product Π i, X i, which is the product space with its product topology.

3) Final check and differences:
- Indexing of the sequence is ℕ in Lean versus the natural language's x1, x2, … (ℕ starting at 1). This is a standard harmless difference with no effect on convergence.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given. It aligns with Mathlib's standard notions (nhds, Filter.atTop, Tendsto) and the product topology on Π i, X i.

- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully formalizes the statement that for each x ∈ [0,1], the sequence x^n converges.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type _}`: Introduces an arbitrary type X.
- `def sInter_topology (𝔖 : Set (TopologicalSpace X)) : TopologicalSpace X := by ...`: Attempts to define a topology on X from a set 𝔖 of topologies on X. The comment explains the intended construction: define IsOpen' U to mean U is open in every topology t ∈ 𝔖, and then build a TopologicalSpace from IsOpen'. However, the body is left as `sorry`, so the definition is not actually provided.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement: Given a family of topologies on X, the intersection of their open sets is a topology on X. The intended Lean construction matches this idea: for 𝔖 ⊆ TopologicalSpace X, define a TopologicalSpace whose opens are those sets open in every t ∈ 𝔖. This would be a faithful formalization if completed. However, the code uses `sorry` for the actual construction, so no legitimate definition is provided. According to the guidelines, auxiliary definitions using `sorry` are vacuous and invalidate the translation.

3) Final comparison:
- Mathematical content aimed for: correct (intersection of a family of topologies yields a topology).
- Formalization choice (set of topologies vs indexed family): acceptable.
- Actual code: incomplete/vacuous due to `sorry`. Therefore, it does not legitimately establish the statement or construct the topology.

Conclusion: Not faithful because the crucial construction is omitted with `sorry`. If the `sorry` were replaced by a proper construction, it would be faithful.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_23_9 {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] {A : Set X} {B : Set Y}`: X and Y are types with topological spaces; A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y (as sets of those types).
- Hypotheses `hA : A ≠ univ`, `hB : B ≠ univ`: A and B are proper subsets (not equal to the whole space). In Lean, `A : Set X` already ensures A ⊆ X, so `A ≠ univ` captures properness; likewise for B.
- Hypotheses `hX : ConnectedSpace X` and `hY : ConnectedSpace Y`: X and Y are connected topological spaces.
- Conclusion: `ConnectedSpace ({p : X × Y // p ∉ A ×ˢ B})`: the subspace of X × Y consisting of points not in the product set A ×ˢ B is connected. This subtype is exactly the set (X × Y) \ (A ×ˢ B) with the subspace topology.
- `by sorry`: proof omitted; acceptable for translation checking.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
The code asserts that the subspace of the product X × Y obtained by removing A × B is connected, under the assumptions that A and B are proper subsets and that X and Y are connected. This matches the natural language statement “(X × Y) − (A × B) is connected” since in topology, saying a subset is connected means that subspace is a connected space; the Lean formulation as a `ConnectedSpace` of the corresponding subtype is the standard formalization of that.

3) Final check for differences:
- Properness: The natural language “proper subset” is captured by `A ≠ univ` and `B ≠ univ`. No extra assumptions like nonemptiness are added.
- Connectedness: The statement uses `ConnectedSpace`, which exactly means X and Y are connected spaces.
- The set (X × Y) − (A × B) is represented as `{p : X × Y // p ∉ A ×ˢ B}`; `×ˢ` is the set-theoretic product, and `∉` expresses set difference relative to X × Y. This is precisely the same set with the subspace topology.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
There are no discrepancies; the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- def B : Set (Set ℝ) := { s | ∃ (a b : ℚ), (a < b) ∧ s = Set.Ioo (a : ℝ) (b : ℝ) }.
  This defines B as the collection of all subsets of ℝ that are open intervals (a,b) with rational endpoints a,b and a < b. The rationals are coerced into ℝ.

- def C : Set (Set ℝ) := { s | ∃ (a b : ℝ), (a < b) ∧ s = Set.Ico a b }.
  This defines C as the collection of all half-open intervals [a,b) with real endpoints a,b and a < b. This is the standard basis for the lower limit (Sorgenfrey) topology on ℝ.

- theorem B_is_basis : @TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis ℝ (TopologicalSpace.generateFrom B) B := by sorry.
  This states that B is a topological basis for the topology generated by B. In other words, with the topology TopologicalSpace.generateFrom B on ℝ, B satisfies the axioms of a topological basis.

- theorem top_of_B_ne_lower_limit : TopologicalSpace.generateFrom B ≠ TopologicalSpace.generateFrom C := by sorry.
  This states that the topology generated by B (open intervals with rational endpoints) is different from the topology generated by C (half-open intervals [a,b) with real endpoints), i.e., different from the lower limit topology.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement asks to show: (i) the collection {(a,b) | a < b, a and b rational} is a basis; and (ii) the topology it generates is different from the lower limit topology on ℝ.
- The code defines precisely the collection of open intervals with rational endpoints (B) and the standard lower limit basis (C). It then asserts that B is a basis for the topology it generates and that this generated topology differs from the lower limit topology generated by C. This matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not claim B is a basis for the standard Euclidean topology; it only claims B is a basis for the topology it generates. The natural language statement also only requires that it be a basis (i.e., for some topology it generates) and that this topology differs from the lower limit topology. Thus there is no mismatch.
- All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders); B and C are concrete sets of sets. The theorems are stated correctly relative to Mathlib's notions (generateFrom, IsTopologicalBasis). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “X is countably compact iff every nested sequence C1 ⊇ C2 ⊇ ⋯ of closed nonempty sets of X has a nonempty intersection.”
- The Lean code’s definition of countable compactness via ℕ-indexed open covers is standard and faithful.
- The nested sequence condition `(∀ n, C (n+1) ⊆ C n)` exactly encodes C1 ⊇ C2 ⊇ ⋯ (allowing equality, as customary).
- Each C_n being nonempty is encoded by `(∀ n, C n ≠ ∅)`.
- Nonempty intersection is encoded as `(⋂ n, C n) ≠ ∅`.
- Indexing by ℕ aligns with the phrasing “sequence.”

- No vacuous definitions; the auxiliary definition of countable compactness is legitimate and standard.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} {Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [LinearOrder Y] [OrderClosedTopology Y]`
  This declares types X and Y with topologies on both X and Y. It also assumes Y has a linear order and that the topology on Y satisfies `OrderClosedTopology` (a property that ensures certain order-related sets are closed; notably it implies good continuity properties for min/max). This is more general than specifically asserting that Y has the order topology; it only assumes the weaker condition that the given topology is order-closed.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_18_8b {f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : Continuous fun x => min (f x) (g x) := by sorry`
  This states: Given continuous functions f, g from X to Y, the function h(x) = min(f x, g x) is continuous. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we're only auditing the statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Y is an ordered set endowed with the order topology; f and g are continuous; define h(x) = min(f(x), g(x)); show h is continuous.
- Lean: Assumes Y has a topology (not explicitly the order topology), a linear order, and satisfies `OrderClosedTopology`. Under these assumptions, if f and g are continuous then so is x ↦ min(f x, g x).

The mathematical content matches the intended result, with the Lean statement being a slight generalization: instead of requiring the topology on Y to be exactly the order topology, it requires the weaker condition `OrderClosedTopology` (which holds for the order topology and for some potentially more general topologies). The use of `LinearOrder` aligns with the need to define `min` unambiguously; in typical textbook phrasing “ordered set” in this context means a linearly ordered set.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- They are essentially the same, with the Lean version being a standard slight generalization. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all typeclasses and notions are from Mathlib. There are no auxiliary definitions. The function h is exactly min(f,g), and the conclusion is continuity.
- The only difference is the assumption on the topology: natural language specifies the order topology; Lean assumes `OrderClosedTopology`. This is a harmless generalization and acceptable per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful, with a mild and legitimate generalization.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in mathlib.
- `/-- The rationals are not locally compact. -/`: Docstring stating the intent.
- `theorem rationals_not_locally_compact [TopologicalSpace Rat] : ¬ LocallyCompactSpace Rat := by sorry`:
  This declares a theorem that, for an arbitrary chosen topology on the type `Rat` (the rationals), `Rat` is not a locally compact space. The bracket `[TopologicalSpace Rat]` is a typeclass parameter, so the statement universally quantifies over all topologies on `Rat`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement “Show that the rationals Q are not locally compact” is understood in standard mathematics to refer to the rationals with their usual topology (the subspace/order topology inherited from R). The Lean statement, however, assumes an arbitrary `TopologicalSpace Rat` and states `¬ LocallyCompactSpace Rat` under that arbitrary choice. This is a much stronger statement and, in fact, false (e.g., with the discrete topology on Q, the space is locally compact). Therefore, the Lean theorem does not faithfully translate the intended statement.

3) Final check:
- Natural language: Q with its standard topology is not locally compact.
- Lean code: For any topology on Q, Q is not locally compact.
These are different; the Lean version is strictly stronger and incorrect in general. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present, but the theorem statement itself does not match the intended meaning.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem statement fixes a real function f : ℝ → ℝ and real numbers a b with a < b (hab : a < b).
- Assumption h_deriv: ∀ x ∈ (a, b), HasDerivAt f (deriv f x) x. This asserts that for every x in the open interval (a,b), f is differentiable at x and its derivative there is the value deriv f x. In other words, f′(x) exists for all x in (a,b).
- Assumption h_pos: ∀ x ∈ (a, b), 0 < deriv f x. This asserts f′(x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a,b).
- Conclusion part 1: StrictMonoOn f (Set.Ioo a b). This means f is strictly increasing on (a,b): if a < x < y < b then f x < f y.
- Conclusion part 2: ∀ x ∈ (a, b), HasDerivAt (Function.invFunOn f (Set.Ioo a b)) (1 / deriv f x) (f x). Here, Function.invFunOn f (Ioo a b) is the canonical “inverse on a set” construction: it picks the unique preimage in (a,b) for points in f((a,b)) (and is arbitrary elsewhere). The statement says that for each x in (a,b), the inverse function g evaluated as invFunOn f (Ioo a b) is differentiable at the point y = f x, and its derivative there equals 1 / f′(x).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural statement: Suppose f′(x)>0 on (a,b). Prove f is strictly increasing on (a,b). Let g be its inverse function. Prove g is differentiable and g′(f(x)) = 1 / f′(x) for a<x<b.
- The Lean assumptions exactly encode that f′ exists and is positive on (a,b). The extra hypothesis h_deriv ensures differentiability everywhere on (a,b), which is implicit in the natural statement.
- StrictMonoOn f (Ioo a b) matches “f is strictly increasing on (a,b).”
- The use of Function.invFunOn f (Ioo a b) is a standard formal stand-in for “the inverse function” defined on the image f((a,b)). The derivative statement HasDerivAt ... at (f x) with value 1 / deriv f x matches “g is differentiable and g′(f(x)) = 1/f′(x) for a<x<b.” Quantifying over x ∈ (a,b) and using the point f x covers all y in the image where the inverse is defined. The statement is precisely at the points in the range where the inverse is meant to be considered.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. The slight formal choice of invFunOn instead of naming an inverse g is appropriate and standard, and evaluating the derivative at y = f(x) matches the natural statement’s g′(f(x)). The added hypothesis a < b is natural for an open interval. There are no material discrepancies.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This defines “f is a quotient map” as: f is continuous and for every subset U of Y, U is open in Y if and only if f⁻¹(U) is open in X. This is a standard definition of a quotient map in topology (some texts additionally require surjectivity as a separate clause; here it is not included, but the open-iff-preimage-open condition is standard and acceptable).

- `theorem retraction_is_quotient_map {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X} (r : X → A) (hr : Continuous r) (hret : ∀ a : A, r a = a) : is_quotient_map r := by sorry`
  This states: Let X be a topological space and A ⊆ X (equipped with the subspace topology as a Lean subtype). If r : X → A is continuous and satisfies r a = a for all a in A (note a : A is a subtype element; Lean coerces a to an element of X when applying r), then r is a quotient map in the above sense. This matches the standard notion of a retraction r: X → A with r restricted to A being the identity on A.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines a retraction of X onto A as a continuous r: X → A with r(a) = a for each a ∈ A. The Lean hypotheses exactly capture this via `hr : Continuous r` and `hret : ∀ a : A, r a = a`.
- The claim “Show that a retraction is a quotient map.” is formalized as concluding `is_quotient_map r` using the standard open-iff-preimage-open definition. This is the usual definition used in topology textbooks (sometimes with explicit surjectivity; here, retractions are automatically surjective onto A since for any a ∈ A, r a = a).

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- No vacuous placeholders: the only auxiliary definition `is_quotient_map` is substantive and standard.
- The theorem’s statement matches the mathematical content of the original statement. The slight definitional variation about explicit surjectivity is not an issue here and is standard; moreover, surjectivity follows from the retraction property in this context.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

  This theorem states: Let X be a type with a topology. Assume (hcof) that this topology is the cofinite topology (opens are ∅ or have finite complement), and assume (hinf) that X is infinite. Then X is connected as a topological space.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: ""Show that if X is an infinite set, it is connected in the finite complement topology."" The code assumes X has the cofinite topology (via `hcof`) and that X is infinite (`hinf`), and concludes `ConnectedSpace X`. This matches the intended claim exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses Type X with a `TopologicalSpace` instance and a Prop `cofinite_topology` that characterizes that instance as the cofinite topology. This is a faithful formalization of ""equipped with the finite complement topology"".
- The infinity assumption is `Set.Infinite (Set.univ : Set X)`, which is precisely that X is infinite.
- The conclusion is `ConnectedSpace X`, matching ""connected"".
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `cofinite_topology` is a legitimate characterization, not a dummy.
No discrepancies found. The translation is faithful.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_32_3 (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [LocallyCompactSpace X] [T2Space X] : RegularSpace X := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology, if X is a locally compact space and is Hausdorff (T2), then X is a regular space. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: ""Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is regular."" In Mathlib, `LocallyCompactSpace X` captures ""locally compact"", `T2Space X` captures ""Hausdorff"", and `RegularSpace X` captures ""regular"" (Mathlib's notion includes the usual T1 separation plus regularity condition). Thus the theorem statement exactly formalizes the given claim.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
- The two statements match: locally compact + Hausdorff implies regular. There is no change of generality or assumptions. Any minor definitional convention (e.g., RegularSpace including T1) is compatible with the Hausdorff hypothesis anyway, so there is no discrepancy.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This declares: For any topological space X and subset A ⊆ X, if X is a normal space (hX) and A is closed in X (hA), then the subspace A (with the induced/subtype topology) is normal. The conclusion `NormalSpace A` refers to the normality of the subtype corresponding to the set A.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Show that a closed subspace of a normal space is normal."" The Lean statement precisely formalizes this: given X normal and A closed, the subspace A is normal. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions, only standard Mathlib notions (`NormalSpace`, `IsClosed`, and the subtype topology via `A` as a type).

3) Final check for differences:
- The code’s `NormalSpace A` is the standard Mathlib notion for the subspace topology on the subtype A. This matches ""closed subspace"" in the natural language.
- Potential definitional nuance: some sources include T1 in the definition of ""normal space""; Mathlib’s `NormalSpace` is the standard separation axiom notion. Either way, the statement remains accurate and faithful. 
- No extraneous assumptions or weakenings/strengthenings are introduced.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the given statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language
- Context: X is a type (a set), and A is a collection of subsets of X, i.e., A : Set (Set X).
- Hypotheses:
  - basis_axiom1: For every x in X, there exists B ∈ A with x ∈ B. This is the basis covering axiom.
  - basis_axiom2: For any B1, B2 ∈ A and any x ∈ B1 ∩ B2, there exists B3 ∈ A with x ∈ B3 and B3 ⊆ B1 ∩ B2. This is the basis intersection axiom.
  These two axioms express that A is a basis for a topology on X.
- Conclusion (the theorem statement):
  TopologicalSpace.generateFrom A equals the infimum (i.e., intersection) of all topologies t on X such that every U ∈ A is open in t. Formally, this is written as the iInf over the subtype { t : TopologicalSpace X // ∀ U ∈ A, IsOpen_t U }, mapping each subtype element to its underlying topology.
  This is precisely the statement: the topology generated by A is the intersection of all topologies on X that contain A.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language statement says: If A is a basis for a topology on X, then the topology generated by A equals the intersection of all topologies on X that contain A.
- The Lean code encodes “A is a basis” via basis_axiom1 and basis_axiom2.
- It asserts the equality between TopologicalSpace.generateFrom A and the intersection (infimum) of all topologies that make every member of A open, i.e., that contain A.
This matches the natural language statement exactly.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The Lean theorem assumes the basis axioms explicitly. The conclusion uses generateFrom and the iInf over topologies containing A. This is exactly the intended result.
- Minor note: In mathlib, generateFrom makes sense even without the basis axioms; the equality holds in full generality. The Lean statement includes the basis axioms as hypotheses, which is consistent with the problem’s phrasing and not a mismatch.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions beyond the theorem. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions.
Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def K : Set ℝ := Set.range (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℝ) / (n + 1))`
  This defines K = { 1/(n+1) | n ∈ ℕ } ⊆ ℝ, i.e., the set {1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}. This matches the classical K used in the K-topology (equivalent to {1/n | n ≥ 1}).

- `def lower_limit_basis : Set (Set ℝ) := { s | ∃ a b : ℝ, a < b ∧ s = Set.Ico a b }`
  This defines the collection of half-open intervals [a, b) with a < b as a generating family (a basis set) for the lower limit (Sorgenfrey) topology.

- `def Sorgenfrey : TopologicalSpace ℝ := TopologicalSpace.generateFrom lower_limit_basis`
  This constructs the topology on ℝ generated by the sets [a, b). This is the usual definition of the lower limit/Sorgenfrey topology.

- `def K_basis : Set (Set ℝ) := { s | ∃ a b : ℝ, a < b ∧ (s = Set.Ioo a b ∨ s = Set.Ioo a b \ K) }`
  This defines the generating family (basis set) for the K-topology as all open intervals (a, b) and the sets (a, b) \ K.

- `def K_topology : TopologicalSpace ℝ := TopologicalSpace.generateFrom K_basis`
  This constructs the K-topology on ℝ as the topology generated by that basis.

- `theorem exists_sorgenfrey_open_not_K : ∃ s : Set ℝ, @IsOpen ℝ Sorgenfrey s ∧ ¬ @IsOpen ℝ K_topology s := by sorry`
  This asserts there exists a set s that is open in the Sorgenfrey (lower limit) topology but not open in the K-topology.

- `theorem exists_K_open_not_sorgenfrey : ∃ s : Set ℝ, @IsOpen ℝ K_topology s ∧ ¬ @IsOpen ℝ Sorgenfrey s := by sorry`
  This asserts there exists a set s that is open in the K-topology but not open in the Sorgenfrey topology.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that the lower limit topology ℝ_l and the K-topology ℝ_K are not comparable. In order-theoretic terms on topologies over the same set, this means neither topology is finer than the other.
- The two theorems exactly capture this: one produces an open set in Sorgenfrey not open in K_topology (showing Sorgenfrey is not ≤ K_topology), and the other produces an open set in K_topology not open in Sorgenfrey (showing K_topology is not ≤ Sorgenfrey). Together, they formalize “not comparable.”
- All auxiliary definitions are bona fide: K is a concrete set, the topologies are legitimately generated by specified basis families using `TopologicalSpace.generateFrom`. No vacuous placeholders are used.
- Using [a,b) as generators for the lower limit topology and {(a,b), (a,b)\K} for the K-topology matches standard definitions.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean code formalizes the exact claim of non-comparability by existential counterexamples in both directions. The identification of ℝ_l with `Sorgenfrey` and ℝ_K with `K_topology` is standard. Minor presentational choice (two separate existence theorems instead of a single statement `¬ (Sorgenfrey ≤ K_topology) ∧ ¬ (K_topology ≤ Sorgenfrey)`) is logically equivalent.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful with no red flags.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Lean math library.
- `variable {k : Type*} {V : Type*} [Field k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]` sets up a field `k` and a type `V` with the structure of an additive commutative group and a `k`-module (i.e., a vector space over the field `k`).
- The theorem `theorem axler_exercise_1_3 (v : V) : -(-v) = v := by sorry` states that for any vector `v` in `V`, the negation operation is involutive: negating twice returns the original vector. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear and precise.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that −(−v) = v for every v ∈ V.” The Lean theorem states exactly this: for all `v : V`, `-(-v) = v`. The ambient assumptions make `V` a vector space over a field, which is in line with typical linear algebra contexts and is stronger than necessary (the statement holds in any additive group), but this specialization is acceptable and faithful to the intended setting.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: universal statement about double negation in `V`.
- Lean: universal statement about double negation in a `k`-vector space `V`.
No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The only difference is a mild specialization (requiring `V` to be a vector space over a field), which does not change the content of the statement. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology and assuming X is a completely regular space, X is connected if and only if its Stone–Čech compactification `StoneCech X` is connected.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly asserts the equivalence between `ConnectedSpace X` and `ConnectedSpace (StoneCech X)` under the hypothesis `[CompletelyRegularSpace X]`. This matches the natural language statement: “Let X be completely regular. Show that X is connected iff the Stone-Čech compactification of X is connected.”
- All concepts used are standard mathlib notions: `TopologicalSpace`, `CompletelyRegularSpace`, `ConnectedSpace`, and `StoneCech`.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task since we only check the statement/translation.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same. A subtlety: in some texts, “completely regular” may implicitly include T1; mathlib’s `CompletelyRegularSpace` may not enforce T1. However, the natural language as given here just says “completely regular,” so the Lean statement is faithful to that phrasing. No substantive mismatch.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: Let f: S¹ → ℝ be continuous. Show ∃ x with f(x) = f(−x).
- The Lean statement uses the standard unit circle model for S¹ with the subspace topology, assumes f is continuous, defines the antipodal map as negation, and asserts the existence of x with f x = f (antipodal x).

Conclusion: There exists a scalar μ such that T equals μ times the identity linear map on V, i.e., T = μ • LinearMap.id.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: ""Suppose T ∈ L(V) is such that every vector in V is an eigenvector of T. Prove that T is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.""
- The code formalizes L(V) as `V →ₗ[K] V` (linear endomorphisms). ""Every vector in V is an eigenvector"" is rendered as ∀ v, ∃ μ, T v = μ v. The conclusion ""T is a scalar multiple of the identity"" is rendered as ∃ μ, T = μ • id. This matches exactly the mathematical meaning.
- Minor nuance: In standard terminology, eigenvectors are nonzero. The code’s hypothesis quantifies over all v, including 0. However, for v = 0, the condition T v = μ v holds for any μ, so including 0 does not change the essence of the hypothesis; the statements ∀ v ≠ 0, ∃ μ, T v = μ v and ∀ v, ∃ μ, T v = μ v are equivalent in effect. Thus no meaningful discrepancy.
- The code assumes K is a field and V a K-vector space, consistent with the natural language setting of linear operators on a vector space.

  Natural language: For any type α equipped with a MetricSpace structure, a (possibly unrelated) TopologicalSpace structure which makes α connected (i.e., [ConnectedSpace α] with respect to that TopologicalSpace), and assuming there exist two distinct points in α, then α is uncountable. Proof omitted.

2) Does this match the original statement?
- The original statement: ""Show that a connected metric space having more than one point is uncountable."" In mathematics, a ""connected metric space"" means the space is connected with respect to the topology induced by its metric.
- The Lean statement introduces both a MetricSpace α and an independent TopologicalSpace α, and assumes [ConnectedSpace α] with respect to that TopologicalSpace. It does not assert that the connected topology is the one induced by the metric. Thus the connectedness may not be the metric connectedness.
- The assumption ""more than one point"" is correctly encoded as `∃ x y, x ≠ y`.
- The conclusion `¬ Countable α` matches ""uncountable"".

3) Final check and differences:
- Key discrepancy: The code allows the topology used for connectedness to be arbitrary and potentially unrelated to the metric. The natural language requires the topology to be the metric topology. Therefore the code states a strictly stronger (and in general false) claim: any type with some metric and some connected topology (not necessarily compatible) and ≥ 2 points is uncountable.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the only issue is the mismatch between the connected topology and the metric topology.
- A faithful formalization should omit the separate `[TopologicalSpace α]` parameter and rely on the canonical topology induced by `[MetricSpace α]`, i.e., use `[MetricSpace α] [ConnectedSpace α]` (letting `ConnectedSpace` implicitly use the topology coming from the metric).

Given this, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_29_10 {x : X} (h_local : ∃ W, W ∈ 𝓝 x ∧ IsCompact (closure (W : Set X)))` assumes there exists a neighborhood W of x whose closure is compact. Here `W ∈ 𝓝 x` means W is a neighborhood of x (not necessarily open), and `IsCompact (closure W)` means the closure of W is compact.

The hypothesis `∃ W ∈ 𝓝 x, IsCompact (closure W)` encodes being locally compact at x in the sense “there exists a (possibly non-open) neighborhood with compact closure.” Although the docstring mentions an open neighborhood, the code does not require W to be open; this is harmless because from any neighborhood W one can pick an open O with x ∈ O ⊆ W, and then `closure O ⊆ closure W`, so `closure O` is compact as a closed subset of a compact set. Thus the open/non-open nuance does not affect faithfulness.
- The conclusion exactly matches the target: given any neighborhood U of x, produce V a neighborhood of x with compact closure contained in U.

Checks for red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions. The theorem statement is precise and standard Mathlib notions are used (`𝓝 x`, `IsCompact`, `closure`, `T2Space`). The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but the task is about translation, not proof.

Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. If anything, the Lean hypothesis is slightly more general (not insisting W is open), which is equivalent/sufficient for the intended result. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_26_11 {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]`:
  X is a compact Hausdorff topological space.
- `{A : Set (Set X)}`:
  A is a collection (set) of subsets of X.
- `(h_closed : ∀ s, s ∈ A → IsClosed (s : Set X))`:
  Every member s of A is closed in X.
- `(h_conn : ∀ s, s ∈ A → IsConnected (s : Set X))`:
  Every member s of A is connected (in mathlib, this also implies s is nonempty).
- `(h_chain : ∀ s t, s ∈ A → t ∈ A → s ⊆ t ∨ t ⊆ s)`:
  The family A is linearly ordered by inclusion: for any s,t in A, either s ⊆ t or t ⊆ s.
- Conclusion: `IsConnected (sInter A)`:
  The intersection of all sets in A is connected.

2) Comparing with the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses on X (compact Hausdorff) match: CompactSpace + T2Space.
- A is a collection of closed connected subsets: matches h_closed and h_conn. Note mathlib’s IsConnected implies nonempty, which is stronger than some textbook conventions (where the empty set can be called connected), but here it is harmless since closed connected implies nonempty in mathlib and yields compact nonempty sets.
- ""Simply ordered by proper inclusion"": the code uses a chain by non-strict inclusion (s ⊆ t ∨ t ⊆ s). For a set of sets (no duplicates), this is effectively equivalent to being simply ordered by proper inclusion: if s ≠ t, then s ⊆ t implies s ⊂ t, etc. So this is acceptable as a faithful formalization.
- Conclusion: Y = ⋂ A is connected corresponds to `IsConnected (sInter A)`.

3) Critical discrepancy:
- The code does not assume that A is nonempty. If A = ∅, then `sInter A = univ`, and the theorem would assert that X is connected, which need not be true. The natural language statement implicitly requires A to be nonempty (otherwise the claim is false). Thus the Lean statement is strictly more general than the intended theorem and, in fact, incorrect in general without the nonemptiness assumption. This is a substantive mismatch.

Final check: The two statements differ because the Lean code omits the assumption that A is nonempty, leading to an invalid conclusion when A = ∅. The ""proper inclusion"" versus ""subset"" phrasing is acceptable, but the missing nonemptiness is a significant issue.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's topology library.
- `universe u v` and `variable {ι : Type u} {X : ι → Type v} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]`: We have an index type ι and a family of types X i, each equipped with a topology.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem Munkres_exercise_32_2b (h : RegularSpace ((i : ι) → X i)) (hne : ∀ i, Nonempty (X i)) : ∀ i, RegularSpace (X i)`
  translates to: If the product space Π i, X i is a regular space, and each factor X i is nonempty, then every X i is a regular space.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that if ∏ X_α is regular, then so is X_α. Assume that each X_α is nonempty."" The Lean theorem exactly matches this: regularity of the product implies regularity of each factor, with the explicit assumption that each factor is nonempty.
- The product is modeled by the Pi type `(i : ι) → X i` with the product topology provided by `[∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]`.
- The conclusion `∀ i, RegularSpace (X i)` matches ""then so is X_α"" for each α.

3) Final check of differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct.
- The use of `RegularSpace` is standard in Mathlib; although some texts distinguish between ""regular"" and ""T1 + regular"" conventions, in typical topology contexts (including Munkres) ""regular"" often includes T1, and Mathlib's `RegularSpace` aligns with that. This is a standard and acceptable formalization.
- The nonemptiness assumption is present as in the natural language statement.
- Therefore, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the original.

Conclusion: The code statement faithfully captures the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Assumptions match: X completely regular; A, B disjoint closed subsets; A compact.
- Conclusion: a continuous function f from X into [0,1] with f(A) = {0} and f(B) = {1}. The Lean statement encodes the codomain [0,1] by requiring 0 ≤ f(x) ≤ 1 for all x while letting f map into ℝ, which is a standard formalization and equivalent in meaning.
- The conditions `(∀ x ∈ A, f x = 0)` and `(∀ x ∈ B, f x = 1)` are the customary formalizations of “f(A) = {0}” and “f(B) = {1}” in analysis/topology texts (i.e., f is constantly 0 on A and 1 on B). Demanding literal set-image equality would additionally require A and B to be nonempty, which is typically not the intended nuance in such statements. The Lean version captures the intended meaning faithfully.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Codomain ℝ with bounds vs. literal codomain [0,1]: equivalent for the purpose of the result.
- Set-image equality vs. pointwise constancy: the Lean statement uses pointwise constancy, which is the standard and intended interpretation; no substantive mismatch.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no placeholders redefining concepts; hypotheses and conclusion align with Mathlib’s standard notions (`CompletelyRegularSpace`, `IsClosed`, `IsCompact`, `Disjoint`, `Continuous`).

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `variable {F : Type*} [Field F]`: F is a field.
- `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]`: V is an additive commutative group and an F-vector space.
- The theorem `Axler_exercise_3_1` takes inputs:
  - `v0 : V` with `hv0 : v0 ≠ 0`.
  - `hspan : ∀ v : V, ∃ a : F, v = a • v0`, i.e., every vector is a scalar multiple of v0.
  - `T : V →ₗ[F] V`, a linear endomorphism of V.
  Conclusion: `∃ a : F, ∀ v : V, T v = a • v`, i.e., T is multiplication by some scalar a.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement assumes `dim V = 1`. The Lean hypothesis `v0 ≠ 0` and `∀ v, ∃ a, v = a • v0` is a standard characterization of V being one-dimensional with a chosen generator (basis vector). Thus, it faithfully encodes the condition `dim V = 1`.
- `T : V →ₗ[F] V` matches the linear map condition.
- The conclusion `∃ a, ∀ v, T v = a • v` matches “T is multiplication by some scalar”.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only difference is the formalization of `dim V = 1` via the existence of a nonzero vector that spans V by scalar multiples. This is an equivalent condition and a standard approach in Lean/Mathlib.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context sets up K as a field, V as an additive commutative group with a K-module structure. In Lean, a ""subspace"" of a vector space corresponds to `Submodule K V`.
- `S : Set (Submodule K V)` denotes an arbitrary collection (possibly empty) of subspaces of V.
- The theorem statement: `∃ W : Submodule K V, (W : Set V) = {v | ∀ U ∈ S, v ∈ (U : Set V)}` says that there exists a submodule W whose underlying set equals the set of vectors v that lie in every submodule U in S. The right-hand set `{v | ∀ U ∈ S, v ∈ (U : Set V)}` is exactly the intersection of the underlying sets of all submodules in S. Thus, the theorem asserts the existence of a submodule whose carrier is that intersection.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""Prove that the intersection of any collection of subspaces of V is a subspace of V."" The Lean theorem asserts exactly that by exhibiting a `Submodule` with carrier equal to the intersection. This handles any collection, including the empty one (the set comprehension is `univ`, corresponding to the top submodule), matching standard conventions.
- All auxiliary notions used (`Submodule`, `Module`, `Field`) are standard Mathlib concepts. There are no vacuous or fake definitions. The presence of `sorry` is in the proof, but we are only auditing the faithfulness of the statement.

Final check:
- The math problems are the same: both state that the intersection of an arbitrary family of subspaces is a subspace. No discrepancies (generality, empty family case, ambient structures) introduce a mismatch. The Lean formulation is a faithful formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_25_4 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] ...` sets up an arbitrary topological space X.
- Hypothesis `hloc : ∀ x : X, ∃ U : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ IsPathConnected U` says: for every point x in X there exists an open set U that contains x and is path-connected. This encodes the property: “every point has at least one path-connected open neighborhood.”
- Conclusion `∀ s : Set X, IsOpen s → IsConnected s → IsPathConnected s` says: every open connected subset s of X is path connected.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; it’s a single theorem statement (proof omitted).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let X be locally path connected. Show that every connected open set in X is path connected.”
- In standard topology (and Mathlib), “locally path connected” means: each point has a neighborhood basis of path-connected open sets (i.e., for every x and every neighborhood W of x, there exists an open V with x ∈ V ⊆ W and V path connected). The Lean code assumes only the weaker property: “for each x, there exists some open path-connected neighborhood of x,” with no requirement that such neighborhoods refine arbitrary neighborhoods.
- The conclusion in the code matches the desired conclusion exactly.
- However, the hypothesis in the code is strictly weaker than the standard definition of “locally path connected.” The docstring in the code equates local path connectedness with the weaker condition, which is not the standard definition.

3) Final comparison:
- The conclusion matches.
- The hypothesis does not faithfully encode “locally path connected” in the standard sense; it is weaker and may not suffice for the theorem in general. This is a significant definitional mismatch.
- No vacuous definitions or placeholders; the issue is the incorrect formalization of the hypothesis.

Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem no_int_solutions_7x3_plus_2_eq_y3 : ∀ x y : Int, 7 * x ^ 3 + 2 ≠ y ^ 3 := by intro x y sorry`
  This declares a theorem stating: For all integers x and y, 7*x^3 + 2 is not equal to y^3. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement is precise.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement is: ""Show that the equation 7 x^{3}+2 = y^{3} has no solution in integers."" This is logically equivalent to the Lean statement `∀ x y : Int, 7 * x ^ 3 + 2 ≠ y ^ 3`, since saying the equation has no integer solutions means there do not exist integers x, y satisfying the equality, i.e., for all integers x, y, the equality does not hold. The types use `Int`, which matches integers. The exponents and arithmetic are correctly on integers.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Quantification over integers: matches.
- Exact equation 7*x^3 + 2 = y^3: matches.
- No auxiliary definitions or placeholders that could distort meaning: none present.

  Natural language: For every natural number N, there exists a natural number p such that p > N, p is prime, and p % 6 = 5.

Assessment of meaning:
- ""There are infinitely many primes congruent to -1 modulo 6"" is classically formalized as: for every N, there is a prime p > N with p ≡ -1 (mod 6).
- In ℕ, being congruent to −1 modulo 6 means being congruent to 5 modulo 6, i.e., remainder 5 upon division by 6. The code uses `p % 6 = 5`, which precisely captures this congruence class for natural numbers because `p % 6` is the remainder in {0,1,2,3,4,5}.
- The quantifier `∀ N, ∃ p > N ...` captures “infinitely many”.
- `Nat.Prime p` is the standard Mathlib predicate that p is a prime natural number.

Final comparison:
- Original: Infinitely many primes with p ≡ −1 (mod 6).
- Lean: For every N, there exists a prime p > N with p % 6 = 5.
These are mathematically equivalent. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is a faithful formalization.

  This states: there exists an element a in U and a real scalar r such that the scalar multiple r • a is not in U. This shows U is not closed under scalar multiplication by real numbers, hence U is not an ℝ-subspace of ℝ^2. The existential quantifier over a ∈ U also witnesses that U is nonempty.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks for an example of a nonempty subset U ⊆ ℝ^2 that is closed under addition and additive inverses, but is not an ℝ-subspace of ℝ^2.
- The code provides such a subset U (points (q,0) with q ∈ ℚ), states the two closure properties under addition and negation, and asserts the existence of an element of U whose scalar multiple by some real number leaves U, thereby showing U is not a subspace. This also implies U is nonempty.

Final check:
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions are used; U is a concrete set. The theorems are stated correctly (even though proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this audit). The mathematical content precisely matches the requested example: closed under addition and inverses, nonempty (implicitly via U_not_subspace), and not a subspace.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `theorem countable_of_countable_dense_disjoint_open_sets {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: Let X be a topological space.
- `{D : Set X} (hD_count : Countable D) (hD_dense : Dense D)`: Suppose D ⊆ X is countable and dense in X.
- `{ι : Type*} (U : ι → Set X)`: Consider a family of subsets of X indexed by ι.

- `(hU_disjoint : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (U i) (U j))`: The family is pairwise disjoint: for i ≠ j, U_i ∩ U_j = ∅.
- Conclusion: `Countable ι`: The index set ι is countable.

Step 2: Assess overall faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement says: If X has a countable dense subset, then every collection of disjoint open sets in X is countable. The code formalizes exactly this, with the standard and necessary additional assumption that the open sets are nonempty. It universally quantifies over an arbitrary index type ι and shows Countable ι under the hypotheses. All predicates used (Countable, Dense, IsOpen, Nonempty, Disjoint) are standard from Mathlib, and there are no placeholder or vacuous definitions.

Step 3: Final check of differences.
- The code explicitly assumes each U_i is nonempty. The natural statement does not state this explicitly. However, the result is false without excluding empty sets (one could take uncountably many empty open sets). Thus adding nonemptiness is a standard, benign, and essentially necessary clarification of the intended theorem. Aside from this, the translation is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with the conventional nonemptiness condition to avoid trivial counterexamples.

- The right-hand side of the Lean statement matches “p and its derivative have no roots in common.” Good.
- The left-hand side in Lean is missing the “distinct” condition. It only asserts that p factors into m linear factors (over ℂ), but does not require the factors (roots) to be pairwise distinct. In Lean, one would need an injectivity/pairwise-distinct condition on xs (e.g., Pairwise (fun i j => xs i ≠ xs j) or Function.Injective xs) to encode “m distinct roots.” As written, xs may repeat values, so repeated roots are allowed.
- Over ℂ, every degree m polynomial splits into linear factors, so the Lean LHS is essentially always true under the given hypotheses (hp and hdeg), making the equivalence reduce to True ↔ (no common roots), which is not the intended statement and is false in general.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: “m distinct roots” ↔ “no common root with derivative.”
- Lean LHS: “splits into m linear factors (possibly with repetition).” This is strictly weaker than “m distinct roots,” and in fact always holds over ℂ for degree m. Thus the two statements are different in a substantial way.
- Other aspects (degree m, nonzero polynomial) align, and the RHS is faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it omits the distinctness requirement on the roots.

theorem two_dvd_one_add_I_sq : 2 ∣ (1 + I) ^ 2 := by sorry
",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: bring in Mathlib.
- Docstring: ""Show that 2 is divisible by (1+i)^{2} in Z[i].""
- `theorem two_dvd_one_add_I_sq : 2 ∣ (1 + I) ^ 2 := by sorry`
  This asserts the theorem: ""2 divides (1 + I)^2"" in whatever ambient ring Lean infers for the symbols `2`, `I`, and `∣`. Since no type is provided, Lean will infer a type supporting `I` and exponentiation; the most likely inference is the complex numbers `ℂ`. In a field like `ℂ`, divisibility is trivial for nonzero divisors, and this is not the intended domain Z[i] (the Gaussian integers).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that 2 is divisible by (1+i)^2 in Z[i]"", which means mathematically: `(1 + i)^2 ∣ 2` in the ring of Gaussian integers `ℤ[i]`.
- The Lean statement claims: `2 ∣ (1 + I)^2` (i.e., 2 divides (1 + i)^2). This is the reverse direction of divisibility. In general rings, `a ∣ b` is not symmetric. While in this particular case in `ℤ[i]` both directions happen to hold because `(1+i)^2 = 2i` and `2` and `(1+i)^2` are associates, the code does not reflect the exact natural-language formulation.
- Furthermore, the Lean code does not specify the ambient ring `ℤ[i]`. It likely lives in `ℂ` (because of `I`), where divisibility is trivial and thus does not capture the intended content about Gaussian integers. A faithful formalization should work in `GaussianInt` (notation `ℤ[i]`) and state `(1 + i)^2 ∣ 2` in that ring.

3) Final check:
- Original: ""(1 + i)^2 divides 2 in ℤ[i]"".
- Lean: ""2 divides (1 + I)^2"" in an unspecified ring (likely `ℂ`).
- Differences:
  - Direction of divisibility is reversed.
  - The ambient ring is not specified as `ℤ[i]` and likely defaults to `ℂ`, changing the meaning substantially (trivializes the claim).

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation of the natural-language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {𝕜 : Type*} {E : Type*} [RCLike 𝕜] [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 E]` sets the context: E is a (real or complex) inner product space over 𝕜.
- `theorem submodule.orthogonal_eq_bot_iff_eq_top (K : Submodule 𝕜 E) : K.orthogonal = ⊥ ↔ K = ⊤ := by sorry` states: For any submodule K of E, the orthogonal complement Kᗮ equals the zero submodule (⊥, i.e., {0}) if and only if K is the top submodule (⊤, i.e., all of E).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Mathematical meaning: The Lean statement asserts Kᗮ = {0} ↔ K = E for any submodule K in any inner product space E over ℝ or ℂ, with no further hypotheses.
- The natural language statement (from Axler 6.16) is typically in the finite-dimensional inner product space context. In finite dimensions, the equivalence is true. However, in general infinite-dimensional inner product spaces, Kᗮ = {0} only implies that K is dense in E; it does not imply K = E unless K is additionally closed (or E is finite-dimensional). Thus, the Lean statement is a strict and generally false generalization of the intended finite-dimensional result.
- Therefore, the code omits a crucial hypothesis (e.g., `[FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E]` or ""K is closed"").

3) Final comparison:
- Same components: Uᗮ = {0} ↔ U = V is correctly rendered as K.orthogonal = ⊥ ↔ K = ⊤.
- Missing assumptions: The Lean code lacks the finite-dimensional (or closedness) hypothesis required for the equivalence to hold, making it not a faithful translation in general.
- No vacuous placeholders/auxiliary definitions are present; the mismatch is in missing hypotheses, not in fake definitions.

Conclusion: The code states a strictly stronger and generally false claim compared to the intended finite-dimensional result. Hence it is not a faithful translation.

  This states: For a linear map T on V, if T* ∘ T = T ∘ T* (i.e., T commutes with its adjoint), then the range of T equals the range of T*.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: If T ∈ L(V) is normal, then range T = range T*. In an inner product space, ""T is normal"" is precisely the condition T* T = T T*, which matches the hypothesis `hT`. The conclusion exactly matches: `LinearMap.range T = LinearMap.range (LinearMap.adjoint T)`.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same mathematical content: yes, the Lean statement encodes exactly “normal ⇒ range T = range T*.”
- Additional structure/assumptions: The Lean version specifies V is a finite-dimensional inner product space over ℝ or ℂ, which is a standard and acceptable specialization since the adjoint is defined and the result is typically stated in that setting. The original statement did not specify the setting but implicitly requires an inner product to define T*, and allowing finite dimensionality is a benign specialization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions: There are none besides standard Mathlib notions; no placeholders.

Conclusion: This is a faithful formalization of the given statement (with a standard, acceptable specialization).

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_1_27 (n : ℕ) (hn : n % 2 = 1) : 8 ∣ (n ^ 2 - 1) := by sorry` translates to: For a natural number n, assuming n % 2 = 1 (i.e., n is odd), prove that 8 divides n^2 − 1. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for assessing translation fidelity.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: ""For all odd n show that 8 | n^2 − 1."" The Lean statement asserts exactly this for n in ℕ, using `n % 2 = 1` to express oddness, and the conclusion `8 ∣ (n ^ 2 - 1)`. This matches the intended statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean version quantifies over natural numbers ℕ; the natural language is slightly ambiguous (could mean integers). Specializing to ℕ is a standard and acceptable interpretation and does not change the mathematical content for odd n.
- The use of `% 2 = 1` instead of the predicate `Odd n` is equivalent in ℕ.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
These are at most minor stylistic or domain specializations, not changes in meaning. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This asserts: For a real number a with a > 0, the Lebesgue integral over ℝ of cos x divided by (x^2 + a^2) equals π * e^(−a) / a. Here `∫ x : ℝ, ... ∂volume` denotes the Lebesgue integral over the whole real line with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure, `Real.cos` is cos, `Real.exp (-a)` is e^(−a), and the RHS is π * e^(−a) / a.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to show that ∫_{−∞}^{∞} cos x / (x^2 + a^2) dx = π e^{−a} / a for a > 0. The Lean statement matches exactly: same integrand, same domain (the whole real line, interpreted as the Lebesgue integral over ℝ which agrees with the improper integral in this context), same condition a > 0, and the same value π e^{−a} / a.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Natural language uses the improper integral over (−∞, ∞); Lean uses the Lebesgue integral over ℝ. These are standardly equivalent for this integrable function, and this is the expected formalization.
- Expression and conditions: Identical (cos x, denominator x^2 + a^2, a > 0, result π e^{−a} / a).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; just a single theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`). The task concerns translation, not proof.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

  For all u, v in V, the inner product ⟪u, v⟫ (a complex number) equals the expression

  where i = Complex.I and scalar multiplication by i is written `Complex.I • v`. The norms are the usual norms induced by the inner product, and `^ 2` denotes squaring. The real quantities ‖…‖^2 are coerced to complex numbers in the expression. This is exactly the complex polarization identity.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts that for a complex inner-product space V, and all u, v ∈ V,
⟨u, v⟩ = (‖u+v‖^2 − ‖u−v‖^2 + i‖u+i v‖^2 − i‖u−i v‖^2)/4.
The Lean statement matches this exactly:
- V is a complex inner-product space: `[InnerProductSpace ℂ V]`.
- Universality in u, v: `(u v : V)`.
- Identical formula with the same placement of i and the same denominator 4.
- Use of `Complex.I • v` for i v and `Complex.I * ...` for multiplication by i is correct.
There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is direct. The presence of `sorry` for the proof is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra hypotheses are introduced.
- No weakening or strengthening of the statement.
- The exact formula and types align with the standard polarization identity for complex inner product spaces under mathlib’s convention (conjugate-linear in the first variable, linear in the second).
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `variable {V : Type*} [SeminormedAddCommGroup V] [SMul 𝕜 V] [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 V]`: We fix a type V with the structure of an inner product space over 𝕜 (hence a vector space with a norm coming from the inner product).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For u, v in V, ⟨u, v⟩ = 0 iff ‖u‖ ≤ ‖u + a v‖ for all a in F. This matches exactly: Lean’s `Inner.inner 𝕜 u v` is ⟨u, v⟩, `a • v` is scalar multiplication av, and `∀ a : 𝕜` is “for all a in F”. The norm is the one induced by the inner product. The field F in the natural language is appropriately captured by `𝕜` with `[RCLike 𝕜]` (the standard setting for inner product spaces in mathlib).

Checks for issues:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. No auxiliary fake definitions. The theorem statement directly expresses the equivalence in the problem.
- The slight technical restriction that 𝕜 is ℝ or ℂ is standard for inner product spaces and aligns with usual meanings of ⟨·,·⟩; it is a standard and acceptable formalization.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's definitions and theorems.
- The theorem `Axler_exercise_7_10` is stated for a type `V` with structure:
  - `[InnerProductSpace Complex V]`: V is a complex inner product space.
  - `[CompleteSpace V]`: V is complete (a Hilbert space). This is a standard technical assumption to talk about the adjoint of a bounded operator.
  - `T : V →L[Complex] V`: T is a continuous (bounded) linear operator on V.
- Hypothesis `h_comm : Commute T (ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint T)`: T commutes with its adjoint, i.e., T is normal.
- Hypothesis `h_pow : T ^ 9 = T ^ 8`: The 9th power of T equals its 8th power, with powers taken in the operator algebra under composition.
- Conclusion: `IsSelfAdjoint T ∧ T ^ 2 = T`: T is self-adjoint and idempotent.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: V is a complex inner-product space, T is a normal operator, and T^9 = T^8; conclude T is self-adjoint and T^2 = T.
- The Lean statement matches this exactly, with the mild technical addition `[CompleteSpace V]` to ensure the adjoint is well-defined as a continuous linear map (standard in Mathlib). This is a harmless specialization consistent with many conventions where an inner product space is assumed complete; even if viewed as a slight strengthening, it is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts (adjoint, commute, powers, self-adjoint) are from Mathlib and correctly used.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically the same, modulo the standard completeness assumption for defining the adjoint. The hypotheses and the desired conclusion match. There are no discrepancies in meaning.

  Interpreting: For every vector v, if T v = μ v (i.e., v ∈ ker(T - μ I)), then T(S v) = μ S v (i.e., S v ∈ ker(T - μ I)). This is exactly the elementwise statement that ker(T - μ I) is S-invariant.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If S and T commute, then for every λ ∈ F, the nullspace ker(T - λ I) is invariant under S. Invariance means: if v ∈ ker(T - λ I), then S v ∈ ker(T - λ I).
- The Lean statement expresses precisely this, for arbitrary μ ∈ F, using the elementwise criterion for membership in the kernel.
- No extra or missing assumptions; no finite-dimensionality is assumed, consistent with the original.

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are the same. The code uses the elementwise formulation `(T v - μ • v = 0 → T (S v) - μ • (S v) = 0)` instead of explicitly naming the kernel or I, but this is equivalent to invariance of `ker (T - μ I)` under S. The commuting hypothesis is correctly encoded as `S.comp T = T.comp S`.

The proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: “Prove that the power series ∑ z^n / n^2 converges at every point of the unit circle.” The Lean theorem asserts: for all z with ‖z‖=1, the series ∑ over n ∈ ℕ of z^n / (n:ℂ)^2 is summable. This matches the intended meaning. The only subtlety is the index starting at n = 0 in Lean; in Mathlib, division by zero is defined as 0, so the n=0 term is 1/0 = 0, making the series effectively start at n=1.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load the math library; no mathematical content.
- `open Real`: Opens the `Real` namespace so `Real.log`, `Real.sin`, etc. are easily accessible; no change in meaning.
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_3_9 : (∫ x in 0..1, Real.log (Real.sin (π * x))) = -Real.log 2 := by sorry`: States the theorem that the interval integral over the real interval from 0 to 1 of the function x ↦ log(sin(πx)) equals −log 2. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show ∫_0^1 log(sin(πx)) dx = −log 2. The Lean statement is exactly this, using Mathlib's interval integral notation `∫ x in 0..1, ...` and Real-valued functions `Real.log`, `Real.sin`, and the constant `π`.
- The logarithm is the natural logarithm in both contexts.
- The integral is the standard real integral over [0,1]; Mathlib's interval integral corresponds to the usual notion and handles endpoint behavior appropriately. This matches the intended improper/ Lebesgue sense in analysis texts.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is a direct, faithful formalization of the given statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Let Ω be a subset of ℂ which is open (hΩ). Let f: ℂ → ℂ be a function that is holomorphic on Ω (hf: complex-differentiable on Ω). Suppose there exists a real constant c such that for all z in Ω, Re(f(z)) = c (h). Then for all z, w in Ω, f z = f w; i.e., f is constant on Ω.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: “Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set Ω. Prove that if Re(f) is constant, then f is constant.”
- The Lean statement matches this exactly:
  - Holomorphic on Ω is modeled by `DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω`.
  - Ω is explicitly assumed open via `IsOpen Ω`.
  - “Re(f) is constant” is modeled by existence of c : ℝ with `∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).re = c`.
  - “f is constant” is expressed as `∀ z w, z ∈ Ω → w ∈ Ω → f z = f w`.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced. The code simply states the theorem.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. Both assert that on an open set Ω, if a holomorphic function has constant real part on Ω, then the function is constant on Ω. The Lean statement’s quantification over z, w in Ω is the standard formalization of “f is constant on Ω.”
- Note: In general complex analysis, connectedness is needed if one wants global constancy across disconnected Ω. The natural language statement as written does not assume connectedness and thus literally matches the Lean statement. Both claim global constancy on Ω under those assumptions. As auditors, we assess translation, not correctness; the translation is faithful to the given wording.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This declares a theorem whose statement is: the set of integers n for which there exist integers a, b, c, d, e, f satisfying n = a^2 + b^2, n + 1 = c^2 + d^2, and n + 2 = e^2 + f^2 is infinite. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but that does not affect the statement's faithfulness.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to prove that there exist infinitely many integers n such that each of n, n+1, and n+2 is a sum of two squares of integers.
- The Lean statement asserts that the set of such integers n is infinite, and it uses separate integer witnesses (a, b) for n, (c, d) for n+1, and (e, f) for n+2. This matches the requirement.
- Using `Int` instead of `Nat` is fine: since sums of squares are nonnegative, any n in the set will be nonnegative automatically. Thus the Lean statement is neither weaker nor stronger in any problematic way; it is equivalent in meaning.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. Both assert the infinitude of integers n with the property that n, n+1, n+2 are sums of two integer squares. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the formalization is direct and faithful.

- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_4_8 (p : ℕ) (hp : Prime p) (hp2 : p ≠ 2) (a : ℤ) (ha : (a : ZMod p) ≠ 0) :` 
  Interprets: Let p be a natural number with p prime and p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime), and let a be an integer such that its class modulo p is nonzero (i.e., p ∤ a).
- `IsPrimitiveRoot (a : ZMod p) (p - 1) ↔`

- `∀ q : ℕ, Prime q → q ∣ p - 1 → (a : ZMod p) ^ ((p - 1) / q) ≠ 1` 
  For every prime q dividing p − 1, we have a^((p − 1)/q) ≠ 1 in ZMod p; i.e., a^((p−1)/q) is not congruent to 1 modulo p.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let p be an odd prime. Show that a is a primitive root modulo p iff a^{(p-1)/q} ≠ 1 (mod p) for all prime divisors q of p − 1.
- The code matches this: it assumes p is an odd prime (`Prime p` and `p ≠ 2`), interprets “primitive root modulo p” as having multiplicative order p − 1 in ZMod p, and the right-hand side is exactly the condition that for every prime divisor q of p − 1, a^{(p−1)/q} is not congruent to 1 modulo p.

3) Differences and their impact:
- The code includes the hypothesis `(a : ZMod p) ≠ 0`, i.e., p ∤ a. This is the standard implicit requirement when discussing primitive roots modulo p (elements must be units mod p). Without this assumption the “iff” would be false (e.g., a ≡ 0 mod p would satisfy the RHS vacuously or incorrectly). Thus this is a faithful and necessary precision, not a change in meaning.
- Using `IsPrimitiveRoot (a : ZMod p) (p - 1)` in ZMod p is the correct formalization of “a is a primitive root modulo p” for prime p. The use of (p − 1) (rather than totient) is also appropriate for prime p.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with proof omitted. Everything used is standard Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with the standard and appropriate explicit assumption that a is nonzero modulo p.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib, then states a theorem `ireland_rosen_exercise_18_4` with no proof (:= by sorry), which is acceptable for our auditing task.
- The theorem asserts a conjunction of three parts:
  1) `(1 : Int)^3 + 12^3 = 1729`: 1729 equals 1 cubed plus 12 cubed.
  2) `(9 : Int)^3 + 10^3 = 1729`: 1729 also equals 9 cubed plus 10 cubed.
  3) A universal minimality statement: For all integers `n a b c d`, if `0 < n` (so n is a positive integer), `a ≠ b` and `c ≠ d` (each representation uses two different integers), `a^3 + b^3 = n` and `c^3 + d^3 = n` (n is representable as a sum of two cubes in two ways), and the two representations are genuinely different up to order `¬((a = c ∧ b = d) ∨ (a = d ∧ b = c))`, then `1729 ≤ n`. This is precisely the minimality condition: any positive integer that can be written as the sum of two different integer cubes in two distinct ways must be at least 1729.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: ""Show that 1729 is the smallest positive integer expressible as the sum of two different integral cubes in two ways."" This contains two components: (i) there are two such representations for 1729, and (ii) minimality.
- The Lean statement includes the two explicit representations: 1^3 + 12^3 and 9^3 + 10^3. It does not explicitly assert 1 ≠ 12 or 9 ≠ 10, but those are evident facts and not necessary to state separately; the equalities suffice to present the two ways.
- The minimality is encoded by the universal quantification with conditions ensuring: n is positive, each representation uses different integers (a ≠ b and c ≠ d), the two representations are distinct up to order (the negation of pair equality/swapped equality), and concluding 1729 ≤ n. This matches the intended meaning of “smallest.”
- The variables a, b, c, d are allowed to be any integers (Int), not necessarily positive. The natural language says “integral cubes,” which typically means integers, not necessarily positive. Thus this matches the phrasing. The condition `0 < n` correctly restricts to positive integers for the minimality claim.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct and faithful.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorem asserts that 1729 has two representations as a sum of two cubes and that any positive integer with two such distinct representations (with different integers in each pair and distinct up to order) is at least 1729. This is exactly the natural language claim. There are no misleading weakenings or strengthenings; allowing integer (possibly negative) bases aligns with “integral cubes.”

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  This states: For natural numbers x and p, if p is prime and p divides the natural number x^4 - x^2 + 1, then the remainder of p upon division by 12 is 1. Equivalently, p ≡ 1 (mod 12). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but we are only auditing the statement.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Show that any prime divisor of x^4 - x^2 + 1 is congruent to 1 modulo 12."" The Lean statement universally quantifies over x and p ∈ ℕ, assumes p is prime and divides x^4 - x^2 + 1, and concludes p % 12 = 1. In ℕ, `p % 12 = 1` is equivalent to p ≡ 1 (mod 12). Thus the Lean theorem exactly captures the intended statement.

3) Final comparison and checks:
- Quantification: The Lean theorem is universally quantified in x and p, matching ""any prime divisor"" for any x.
- Domain: Lean uses natural numbers. The polynomial x^4 - x^2 + 1 is always nonnegative for x ∈ ℕ, so divisibility in ℕ is appropriate. No underflow issue with subtraction since x^4 ≥ x^2 for all x ∈ ℕ.
- Congruence vs remainder: `p % 12 = 1` correctly expresses ""congruent to 1 modulo 12"" in ℕ.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem signature with standard Mathlib notions.
There are no discrepancies; the statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_1_13c {Ω : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (h_open : IsOpen Ω)` introduces an open set Ω in ℂ and a function f : ℂ → ℂ, with the assumption that Ω is open.
- `(h_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω)` asserts that f is complex differentiable on Ω (i.e., holomorphic on Ω).
- `(c : ℝ) (h_abs : ∀ z ∈ Ω, Complex.abs (f z) = c)` introduces a real constant c and assumes that for all z in Ω, |f(z)| = c. This formalizes “|f| is constant on Ω.”
- Conclusion: `∃ w : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = w` states there exists a complex number w such that for all z in Ω, f(z) = w; i.e., f is constant on Ω.
No auxiliary definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: “Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set Ω. Prove that if |f| is constant, then f is constant.”
- Holomorphic on an open set Ω matches `DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω` with `IsOpen Ω`.
- “|f| is constant” matches the existence of c with `∀ z ∈ Ω, |f z| = c`.
- “then f is constant” matches `∃ w, ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = w`.
Thus, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Domain: Both specify Ω is an open subset of ℂ, not necessarily connected. The statement (as written) claims global constancy on Ω; the Lean code claims exactly that. While the classical theorem often assumes connectedness (or concludes constancy on each connected component), the provided natural language statement does not include that assumption, and neither does the Lean code. So they match.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The theorem is stated with standard Mathlib predicates and no fake definitions.
- No extraneous assumptions are added; no essential assumptions are missing relative to the natural language.
Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- The parameter `n : ℕ` with hypothesis `0 < n` matches “for each positive integer n”.
- The numeric expression `10 ^ (10 ^ (10 ^ n)) + 10 ^ (10 ^ n) + 10 ^ n - 1` exactly matches the stated number, with explicit parentheses ensuring the exponent tower is correct.

  Natural language translation: For a natural number n with n ≥ 1, for every complex z with |z| ≤ 1, the sum over k = 0 to n-1 of (n - k)·z^k (with coefficients viewed in ℂ) is nonzero.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The polynomial is defined identically: coefficients (n-k) for k from 0 to n-1, so the terms are n, (n-1)z, ..., z^{n-1}.
- The domain of z is ℂ and the condition |z| ≤ 1 expresses the closed unit disk.
- The conclusion “≠ 0” states there are no roots in that disk.

- The Lean sum matches the exact polynomial. The inequality is the same closed unit disk. Quantification over all z is explicit. No extraneous conditions are added.

- Theorem `exists_condensation_point_of_uncountable {E : Set ℝ} (h : ¬ E.Countable) : ∃ p : ℝ, is_condensation_point E p := by sorry`:
  Natural language: If E ⊆ ℝ is uncountable, then there exists a real number p such that p is a condensation point of E (i.e., every open interval around p contains uncountably many points of E). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for the translation audit as there is no vacuous redefinition.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: “Suppose that E is an uncountable subset of ℝ. Prove that there exists a point p ∈ ℝ at which E condenses.”
- Lean: Assumes E is uncountable (`¬ E.Countable`) and concludes existence of p with the defined condensation property. This matches the intended theorem exactly, specialized to ℝ.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only potential discrepancy is the phrase “punctured neighborhood” in the docstring versus the use of an open interval including p in the code. For uncountability, including or excluding the point p makes no difference, so the formal property is equivalent to the standard definition. The quantification over radii r>0 (open intervals) suffices in ℝ to express “every neighborhood”.
- No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition is substantive and standard; there are no fake definitions like `:= True`.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- We work over a type 𝕜 which is a nontrivially normed field (e.g., ℝ or ℂ). 
- s : Set 𝕜 is a subset assumed to be open (IsOpen s) and connected (IsConnected s). This matches the notion of a “region” (open and connected set).
- f, F, G : 𝕜 → 𝕜 are functions. The hypothesis ContinuousOn f s states f is continuous on the region s.
- The hypotheses (hF : ∀ x ∈ s, HasDerivAt F (f x) x) and (hG : ∀ x ∈ s, HasDerivAt G (f x) x) mean F and G are primitives of f on s, i.e., at every point x ∈ s, the derivative of F at x is f(x), and likewise for G.
- The conclusion ∃ c : 𝕜, ∀ x ∈ s, F x = G x + c says there exists a constant c so that on s the two primitives differ by the constant c.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The original statement: “Suppose f is continuous in a region Ω. Prove that any two primitives of f (if they exist) differ by a constant.”
- The code assumes: s is a region (open, connected), f is continuous on s, and F and G are primitives of f on s. The conclusion is exactly that F and G differ by a constant on s.
- Thus the logical content precisely matches the original statement. The explicit continuity assumption matches the natural language. The “if they exist” is represented by the existence of F and G satisfying the derivative condition (hF, hG).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain/codomain generality: The code allows any nontrivially normed field 𝕜, not just ℝ or ℂ. This is a slight generalization, acceptable by the guidelines.
- F, G are defined on all of 𝕜 but the derivative condition and the conclusion are restricted to s, which is a standard formalization technique and faithful to the statement that they are primitives on s.
- Region nonemptiness is not assumed; if s is empty, the conclusion is vacuously true, which does not conflict with the original intent. This is a benign technicality.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement with meaningful hypotheses and conclusion.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a mild generalization) of the natural language statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If G is a finite group, prove that there is an integer m > 0 such that a^m = e for all a ∈ G.""
- Lean: Assumes `G` is a finite group via `[Group G] [Fintype G]`. Concludes existence of `m : Nat` with `0 < m` and `a^m = 1` for all `a : G`.
- The use of `Nat` with `0 < m` matches “integer m > 0.” The identity element is denoted by `1` in multiplicative notation, corresponding to `e`. The universal quantification over all `a : G` matches the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra assumptions (e.g., commutativity) are added; non-abelian groups are allowed, as in the original.
- The formulation uses standard Lean/Mathlib conventions (`1` for identity, natural exponents) and is equivalent to the given statement.

- `(hf : (∑' i, (c i : ℝ) * ((2 : ℝ) / 3) ^ i) = (3 : ℝ) / 2)`: the power series evaluated at x = 2/3 equals 3/2. The series is written as a real tsum with coefficients coerced to ℝ.
- Conclusion: `¬ ∃ (p q : Int), q ≠ 0 ∧ (∑' i, (c i : ℝ) * ((1 : ℝ) / 2) ^ i) = (p : ℝ) / (q : ℝ)`. This asserts that the value at x = 1/2 is not equal to any rational number p/q with integers p, q and q ≠ 0, i.e., the value is irrational.

2) Overall faithfulness:
- The Lean code models f(x) = Σ c_i x^i via tsum of (c i : ℝ) * x^i.
- Coefficients restricted to 0 or 1 exactly as stated.
- Hypothesis matches f(2/3) = 3/2.
- Conclusion encodes “f(1/2) is irrational” as “not equal to any rational p/q,” which is a standard equivalent formulation. Using Int for p, q is standard and fully general for rationals.
- The code does not define f as a separate function but inlines the sums at the two evaluation points; this is a faithful formalization choice.
- The use of tsum is standard in Mathlib; while tsum has a default value when not summable, here the hypothesis gives a concrete value at 2/3, and the intended reading at 1/2 is the usual series sum—this is acceptable for a faithful translation of the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing from i = 0 to ∞ via ℕ matches the statement.
- Coefficients as Int with values 0 or 1 matches the 0/1 requirement.
- Real-valued sums and rational comparisons in ℝ are correct.
- The conclusion is logically equivalent to “irrational.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem with an omitted proof, which is allowed per the auditing task.

",5,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_2_9 (Ω : Set ℂ) (φ : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ)` introduces a set Ω in ℂ, a function φ from ℂ to ℂ, and a point z0 in ℂ.
- `(hΩ : IsOpen Ω)` assumes Ω is open.
- `(hΩ_bounded : True)` is a placeholder assumption saying nothing; it is intended to represent boundedness of Ω but is vacuous.
- `(hφ_holomorphic : True)` is a placeholder for “φ is holomorphic” but is vacuous.
- `(hz0 : z0 ∈ Ω)` assumes z0 ∈ Ω.
- `(hfix : φ z0 = z0)` assumes φ fixes z0.
- `(hderiv1 : True)` is a placeholder for “φ′(z0) = 1” but is vacuous.
- Conclusion: `∃ a b : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, φ z = a * z + b` asserts there exist complex numbers a, b such that for all z in Ω, φ(z) = a z + b. This means φ is (affine) linear on Ω.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the original statement.
Original statement: Ω is a bounded open subset of ℂ, φ: Ω → Ω is holomorphic, there exists z0 ∈ Ω with φ(z0) = z0 and φ′(z0) = 1, then φ is linear.

Discrepancies:
- Boundedness: In the code, boundedness is encoded as `True` (vacuous). This does not enforce boundedness.
- Holomorphic: Encoded as `True` (vacuous); no actual holomorphic-on-Ω condition.
- Derivative condition φ′(z0) = 1: Encoded as `True` (vacuous).
- Mapping property φ: Ω → Ω: The code has φ : ℂ → ℂ and does not assume φ maps Ω into Ω. This is a missing hypothesis compared to the natural language.
- Domain/codomain formalization: It is common in Lean to take φ : ℂ → ℂ and require `HolomorphicOn φ Ω`, but here that requirement is absent (replaced by True), and the mapping-into-Ω hypothesis is missing entirely.
- Conclusion: The conclusion that φ is of the form az + b on Ω matches the intended meaning of “φ is linear” (affine linear) on Ω. So the conclusion format is acceptable.

Step 3: Final comparison.
The code uses multiple vacuous placeholders (`True`) in place of crucial hypotheses (boundedness, holomorphicity, derivative condition). It also omits the assumption that φ maps Ω into Ω. Therefore, the statement in Lean does not faithfully encode the natural language theorem; it is much weaker and essentially unrelated to the analytic content. Even if the `True` placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib predicates (e.g., `IsBounded Ω`, `HolomorphicOn φ Ω`, and a derivative condition at z0), the mapping property φ(Ω) ⊆ Ω would still be missing. Hence, as written, it is not a faithful translation.

  - Natural language: Let f: ℝ → ℝ be C^3 (i.e., ContDiff ℝ 3 f). Assume f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and f(2) = 0. Then there exists a real number a with 0 < a < 2 such that the third derivative of f at a equals 0, i.e., f‴(a) = 0. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does this translate the given natural language statement?
- The provided natural language statement is incomplete: ""Let f be a real function on the real line with continuous third derivative. Prove that there exists a point a such that"" and then it ends. It does not specify any additional assumptions (like values of f at specific points), nor does it specify what property a should satisfy, nor any interval in which a lies.
- The Lean code states a much more specific problem: under the extra assumptions f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = 0, there exists a ∈ (0, 2) with f‴(a) = 0.
- While the Lean statement matches a known problem (Putnam 1998 A3) and uses an appropriate formalization (ContDiff ℝ 3 encodes that the third derivative exists and is continuous; deriv (deriv (deriv f)) a = 0 means f‴(a) = 0), the given natural language text does not include the necessary hypotheses or the precise conclusion. Therefore, as given, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the incomplete natural language statement.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The natural language statement is missing the conditions f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = 0 that appear in the Lean theorem.
  - It is missing the conclusion; the Lean theorem concludes there exists a in (0,2) such that f‴(a) = 0.
  - It is missing the interval (0,2) specification for a.
- Conclusion: They are different; the Lean code adds substantial hypotheses and a specific conclusion not present in the provided (incomplete) natural language text.

Given there are no vacuous placeholders in the code and it uses standard Mathlib notions correctly, but the mismatch is due to the natural language statement being incomplete and lacking the extra hypotheses and conclusion in the code, this cannot be judged faithful.

  This declares a theorem for a real parameter p with hypothesis p ≤ 1, asserting that the real series with general term a_n = 1 / ((n+2) * (log(n+2))^p) is not summable. In Mathlib, `Summable` for a sequence indexed by ℕ corresponds to convergence of the infinite series ∑ a_n. The use of `n + 2` shifts the index so that the logarithm is applied to values ≥ 2, ensuring positivity and avoiding log(0) or log(1). The exponent `^ p` uses real exponentiation (Real.rpow), valid since log(n+2) > 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: prove that ∑ 1/(k (log k)^p) diverges when p ≤ 1. The Lean statement asserts non-summability (divergence) of the series with general term 1 / ((n+2) (log(n+2))^p). This is exactly the same series, reindexed by k = n + 2. Reindexing by a finite shift does not affect summability, so the content is the same. The hypothesis p ≤ 1 matches the condition.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: The natural statement implicitly starts at k ≥ 2 (to avoid log 1 = 0). The Lean code explicitly starts at n = 0 with k = n + 2, which is standard and equivalent.
- Logarithm: Lean uses the natural logarithm `Real.log`, which is the standard convention. Any other log base would differ by a constant factor inside the power, which does not affect convergence/divergence; but the usual interpretation is indeed natural log.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct and uses Mathlib's standard notions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  • Conclusion: `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` iff `orderOf (-a) = (p - 1) / 2`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- ""a is a primitive root modulo p"" is formalized as `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` in the multiplicative monoid of `ZMod p`. In a field `ZMod p` (p prime), this exactly means a has multiplicative order p−1, i.e., it generates the multiplicative group of units modulo p. So this matches the standard notion of primitive root modulo p.
- ""-a has order (p-1)/2"" is formalized as `orderOf (-a) = (p - 1) / 2`, i.e., the multiplicative order of −a in `ZMod p` equals (p−1)/2. This matches the statement.
- The condition ""p of the form 4t+3"" is captured by `p % 4 = 3`, equivalent to p ≡ 3 (mod 4).
- No extraneous assumptions are added; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.

3) Final check and possible discrepancies:
- Domain of a: The natural statement is about integers mod p; using `a : ZMod p` is the standard formalization and is faithful.
- Group vs monoid: `orderOf` and `IsPrimitiveRoot` are interpreted in the multiplicative structure on `ZMod p`. Since p is prime, nonzero elements are units, and the notions coincide with the classical group-of-units definitions. If a were zero, both sides of the equivalence are false, so the statement remains correct. Thus no issue.
- The formulation using `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` instead of e.g. “a generates (ZMod p)ˣ” is standard and equivalent in this context.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. No auxiliary bogus definitions, no scope mismatches, and the constraints match exactly.

- `def leg_sym (a p : Int) ... : Int := if p ∣ a then 0 else if (∃ x : Int, p ∣ (x * x - a)) then 1 else -1`
  This defines a function `leg_sym a p` on integers: it returns 0 if `p` divides `a`; otherwise it returns 1 if there exists an integer `x` with `p | (x^2 - a)` (i.e., `a` is a quadratic residue mod `p`), and otherwise returns −1. This mirrors the usual Legendre symbol definition for odd primes `p`, but here it is defined for arbitrary integers `p` (no primality, positivity, or oddness assumed).

- The theorem `ireland_rosen_exercise_5_37` states: for integers `a, p, q`, if `a < 0`, `(4*a) | (p - q)` (i.e. `p ≡ q (mod 4a)`), and `¬ p ∣ a` (i.e. `p ∤ a`), then `leg_sym a p = leg_sym a q`. The extra decidability assumptions are just technical to make `leg_sym` type-check; they don't change the mathematical content.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Show that if a is negative then p ≡ q (4 a) together with p ∤ a imply (a/p) = (a/q).” The notation `(a/p)` is the Legendre symbol, which by standard convention is defined for odd prime moduli `p` (and similarly for `q`). The statement tacitly presumes `p` and `q` are odd primes, and also `q ∤ a` is implicitly forced by the congruence plus `p ∤ a` (since `a | q` would imply `a | p`).
- Lean theorem: Uses a custom `leg_sym` rather than Mathlib’s Legendre/Jacobi/Kronecker symbols, and does not assume `p` or `q` are primes, positive, or odd. It asserts the equality for all integers `p, q` satisfying the congruence and `p ∤ a`.

3) Are the two statements the same?
- Differences:
  - Domain of the symbol: The Lean code defines and uses `leg_sym` for arbitrary integers `p`, not (odd) primes. This is a nontrivial generalization and changes the meaning outside the prime case.
  - Use of standard library concepts: It does not use Mathlib’s built-in Legendre/Jacobi/Kronecker symbols, opting for a bespoke definition. While the definition matches the Legendre symbol when `p` is an odd prime, it is not the standard object otherwise.
  - Missing primality assumptions: The natural language context of Legendre symbol suggests `p, q` are odd primes; the Lean statement omits this. This is a substantive mismatch in hypotheses and intended meaning.
- Minor point: The missing hypothesis `q ∤ a` is indeed implied by `(4a) | (p - q)` together with `p ∤ a`, so that part is acceptable.

Conclusion: Although the theorem’s shape echoes the intended result and the custom definition aligns with the Legendre symbol when `p, q` are odd primes, the Lean statement is a broader claim about a nonstandard extension of the symbol to arbitrary integers and omits primality/oddness assumptions. This is not a faithful, literal translation of the natural language statement involving the classical Legendre symbol. Therefore it does not pass as faithful.

This uses standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsClosed) and the metric space structure to induce the topology.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_2_5 {G : Type*} [Group G]`: Let G be a group.
- `(h3 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ 3 = a ^ 3 * b ^ 3)`: Assume for all a, b in G, (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3.
- `(h5 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ 5 = a ^ 5 * b ^ 5)`: Assume for all a, b in G, (ab)^5 = a^5 b^5.
- `: ∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a`: Conclude that for all a, b in G, ab = ba, i.e., G is abelian.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted (allowed for this auditing task; we only check the statement/translation).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement assumes G is a group with the two power-distributivity conditions for exponents 3 and 5, and asks to show G is abelian. The Lean theorem takes exactly those hypotheses as assumptions `h3` and `h5` and concludes `∀ a b, a * b = b * a`. This is precisely the formalization of “G is abelian.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification matches: both conditions are stated for all a, b, and the conclusion is universal.
- The group structure and exponentiation are the usual ones in Lean for groups.
- No extra or missing hypotheses.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement.
Hence the Lean statement is a faithful translation.

- def unit_disk : Set ℂ := { z | ‖z‖ < 1 }: Define the open unit disk in ℂ as {z : |z| < 1}.
- def closed_unit_disk : Set ℂ := { z | ‖z‖ ≤ 1 }: Define the closed unit disk {z : |z| ≤ 1}.

  Translation: For arbitrary predicates holomorphic_on and continuous_on, there does not exist a function f : ℂ → ℂ such that f is holomorphic_on the unit disk (per the given predicate), continuous_on the closed unit disk (per the given predicate), and f(z) = 1/z for all z on the unit circle. No proof provided.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: There is no holomorphic function on the unit disk that extends continuously to the boundary ∂D and has boundary values f(z) = 1/z for z ∈ ∂D. A standard formalization would state: there is no f : ℂ → ℂ with HolomorphicOn unit_disk f, ContinuousOn f closed_unit_disk (or at least continuous extension to ∂D), and ∀ z ∈ unit_circle, f z = 1/z.
- The code uses correct geometric sets (unit disk, closed disk, unit circle) and a negated existence form matching the intended logical shape.
- However, the crucial predicates holomorphic_on and continuous_on are not Mathlib’s actual HolomorphicOn and ContinuousOn; they are arbitrary parameters with no constraints. This makes the theorem quantify over all possible predicates, which is much stronger and not faithful: the truth of the statement would depend on how those predicates are instantiated, and for some choices it becomes false or trivially true. Thus, the code is not a faithful translation.
- Minor nuance: the natural statement says “extends continuously to ∂D”. The code requires continuity on the closed unit disk. This is a slightly stronger condition but acceptable as a reasonable formalization; it does not by itself break faithfulness.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different. The main mismatch is that the theorem is stated for arbitrary abstract predicates rather than the standard Mathlib notions of holomorphy and continuity. This violates the requirement for a legitimate, faithful translation. The set definitions are fine, and the logical shape (negated existence with boundary condition) matches, but the use of arbitrary predicates is a critical discrepancy.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library.
- The theorem `tendsto_sqrt_succ_sub_sqrt_zero` states: the function from natural numbers `n` to real numbers given by `Real.sqrt ((n : ℝ) + 1) - Real.sqrt (n : ℝ)` tends to `0` in the reals as `n` goes to infinity. In Lean terms: `Filter.Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)) Filter.atTop (nhds 0)`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: Prove that sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n) → 0 as n → ∞.
- The Lean statement precisely formalizes this for a sequence indexed by ℕ, using the atTop filter on ℕ to represent n → ∞ and `nhds (0 : ℝ)` for convergence to 0. The function is exactly `sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)`, with `n` cast to ℝ. This is a direct and standard formalization.

3) Final check:
- The formal statement and the natural language statement are the same mathematical claim. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which does not affect the faithfulness of the statement itself. No discrepancies found.

  In words: For natural numbers `a` and `n`, assuming `a > 1` and `n > 0`, we have that `n` divides `φ(a^n − 1)`, where `φ` is the Euler totient function `Nat.totient`. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The original statement: ""If a > 1 is an integer, show that n | φ(a^n − 1), where φ is the Euler φ-function."" The Lean formalization uses `a, n : ℕ` with `1 < a` and explicitly requires `0 < n`. This matches the standard interpretation: both `a` and `n` are positive integers, with `a > 1` and `n ≥ 1`. Using `Nat.totient` on the natural number `a^n - 1` is appropriate; since `a > 1` and `n > 0`, we have `a^n ≥ 2`, so `a^n - 1` is a positive natural number (avoiding truncated subtraction issues).

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain: NL says integers; Lean uses natural numbers. Given `a > 1`, this is equivalent in context (we only consider positive integers). 
- Additional assumption: Lean requires `n > 0`, which is a standard implicit assumption for such divisibility claims and avoids the degenerate `n = 0` case. This is a benign and faithful specialization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement directly matches the intended theorem.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  - `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted (acceptable per instructions; we only audit the statement/translation).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines q_k = p_{f(k)} as a rearrangement and asks to show that if f is injective, then the limit is unaffected. The Lean statement exactly says: if p → a, then p ∘ f → a, assuming f is injective. This directly matches “the limit of a sequence is unaffected by rearrangement” under the hypothesis that f is injective.
- The Lean version is even slightly more general, working in an arbitrary topological space rather than (say) ℝ, which is an acceptable generalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language uses the term “rearrangement”; sometimes this implies a bijection (permutation), but the statement to prove explicitly assumes only injective f. The Lean code also assumes only injectivity, exactly matching the task “Show that if f is an injection...”.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The Mathlib terms `Tendsto`, `atTop`, and `nhds` are standard and appropriate.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {V : Type _}`: Introduces an arbitrary type V (no algebraic structure declared).
- `variable (zero : V)`: Picks an arbitrary element of V to play the role of zero, but without assuming it is the additive identity.
- `variable (diff : V → V → V)`: An arbitrary binary function on V intended to model subtraction, with no axioms.
- `variable (smul : ℝ → V → V)`: An arbitrary operation intended to model scalar multiplication by real numbers, with no axioms connecting it to any additive structure.
- `variable (norm : V → ℝ)`: An arbitrary function intended to be a norm, with no properties assumed (e.g., nonnegativity, triangle inequality).
- `variable (T : V → V)`: An arbitrary function on V, intended to be the linear operator; linearity is not assumed.
- `variable (self_adjoint : Prop)`: A placeholder proposition intended to mean T is self-adjoint; crucially, it is never used in the theorem statement.

The theorem statement:
- `theorem Axler_exercise_7_14 (a : ℝ) (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) :` If there exists `v : V` with `norm v = 1` and `norm (diff (T v) (smul a v)) < ε`, then there exist `a' : ℝ` and `w : V` with `w ≠ zero`, `T w = smul a' w`, and `Real.abs (a - a') < ε`.
- The theorem uses `by sorry`, i.e., no proof is provided (allowed for the purposes of this auditing task), but more importantly the statement is made over completely abstract operations without any required structure.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original: T is self-adjoint on an inner-product space (implicitly finite-dimensional in Axler), scalar λ ∈ F (ℝ or ℂ), ε>0. If there exists a unit vector v with ‖Tv − λv‖ < ε, then T has an eigenvalue λ' with |λ − λ'| < ε.
- Discrepancies:
  - Missing hypothesis: The Lean theorem does not assume self-adjointness at all (the placeholder `self_adjoint : Prop` is unused). This is a critical omission.
  - Missing linearity and vector space structure: T is not assumed linear; V is not given additive or scalar structure via typeclasses; `diff`, `smul`, `norm`, and `zero` are arbitrary functions/elements with no axioms, so the statement is not about a normed vector space or inner-product space.
  - Field restriction: The code fixes scalars to ℝ, while the original allows a general field F (typically ℝ or ℂ). For self-adjoint operators over ℂ, eigenvalues are real but the original statement is formulated over F.
  - Zero vector: The code uses an arbitrary element `zero : V` rather than the actual zero vector, so `w ≠ zero` does not even mean “nonzero vector” in the vector space sense.
  - Use of Mathlib: The code avoids Mathlib’s standard structures (Normed space, InnerProductSpace, LinearMap, IsSelfAdjoint, etc.) and replaces them with ad hoc placeholders, violating the guideline to use applicable Mathlib terms.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is far from a faithful formalization. It drops essential hypotheses (self-adjointness, linearity, vector space and norm structure), restricts scalars to ℝ, and replaces standard structures with arbitrary functions. Consequently, the formal statement is not a legitimate encoding of the original mathematical claim.

Given these issues, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use the Mathlib library.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_41 {m : ℕ} [NormedAddCommGroup (Fin m → ℝ)] :`: For any natural number m, and given a norm structure making the additive group (Fin m → ℝ) a normed additive commutative group (i.e., a norm on R^m),
- `IsCompact ({ x : Fin m → ℝ | ‖x‖ ≤ 1 }) := by sorry`: the set of all x in (Fin m → ℝ) with norm at most 1 is compact.

Interpretation: (Fin m → ℝ) is the standard Lean representation of ℝ^m. The set `{ x | ‖x‖ ≤ 1 }` is precisely the closed unit ball B. `IsCompact` asserts compactness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For any norm on ℝ^m, the closed unit ball B = {x ∈ ℝ^m : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} is compact.
- The Lean statement: For any m and any normed additive commutative group structure on (Fin m → ℝ), the closed unit ball is compact.
- This matches the intended mathematical content: it treats ℝ^m as (Fin m → ℝ), quantifies over norms via the typeclass `[NormedAddCommGroup (Fin m → ℝ)]`, and asserts compactness of the closed unit ball.

3) Comparison and potential differences:
- Slight generalization: The code assumes only a `NormedAddCommGroup` structure rather than a full `NormedSpace ℝ` structure. The natural-language phrase “any norm on ℝ^m” typically means a vector space norm; `NormedAddCommGroup` is a weaker assumption (a group norm). However, the statement being proven (compactness of the unit ball) does not explicitly use scalar multiplication, and the intent is clearly to quantify over norms on ℝ^m. This is a harmless generalization for the purpose of translation and keeps the essence of the statement.
- Representation: Using `(Fin m → ℝ)` for ℝ^m is standard and faithful.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly matches the claim.

Conclusion: The Lean code is an essentially faithful formalization of the natural language statement, arguably slightly more general in typeclass assumptions but not in a way that distorts the claim.

  Natural language translation: Let k be a field. For every two-sided ideal I of the ring of 2×2 matrices over k, we have either I is the zero ideal (⊥) or I is the whole ring (⊤).
  Notes:
  - `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) k` denotes the ring of 2×2 matrices over k.
  - `Ideal` in Mathlib for (possibly noncommutative) rings means two-sided ideals.
  - `⊥` is the zero ideal; `⊤` is the whole ring of matrices.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement is for k = ℝ (the real numbers) and says any ideal of M₂(ℝ) is 0 or the whole ring. The Lean statement is a slight generalization: it asserts the same for any field k. This strictly contains the ℝ case, so it is faithful (indeed stronger) relative to the original claim.
- The structure “suppose I is an ideal; show I = 0 or R” corresponds to the Lean universal quantification over I: `∀ I, I = ⊥ ∨ I = ⊤`.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes, up to a benign generalization. The Lean theorem covers the ℝ case since ℝ is a field. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions. The only difference is generality (arbitrary field versus ℝ), which is acceptable per the guidelines.

Similarly, ` [Group G2] [Fintype G2] [Pow G2 ℤ] [IsCyclic G2]` for G2: G2 is a finite cyclic group as well, with group structure and integer power structure.

- Conclusion: `IsCyclic (G1 × G2) ↔ Nat.Coprime m n`: The direct product group G1 × G2 is cyclic if and only if m and n are coprime.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: If G1 and G2 are cyclic groups of orders m and n, respectively, then G1 × G2 is cyclic iff m and n are relatively prime.
- The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: it assumes G1 and G2 are finite cyclic groups, with their orders specified by hm and hn as m and n, and asserts the equivalence between IsCyclic (G1 × G2) and Nat.Coprime m n.
- The extra typeclass `[Pow G ℤ]` is harmless and standard in Mathlib; it does not change the meaning. No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions: Group, Fintype, IsCyclic, and Nat.Coprime.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- They are the same. The Lean theorem is a faithful restatement of the classical result: product of two finite cyclic groups is cyclic iff their orders are coprime.
- No discrepancies: finiteness is explicit, orders are matched to m and n, and the iff is stated correctly. The inclusion of `[Pow _ ℤ]` is an innocuous extra assumption that holds for any group in Mathlib and does not alter the statement.

Natural language: Given a type G with a group structure and a finite set of exactly 5 elements, we (purport to) produce a commutative group structure on G.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: ""Show that a group of order 5 must be abelian."" This means: given the existing group structure on G with |G| = 5, the operation of that group is commutative (i.e., ∀ a b, a * b = b * a), or equivalently, G is an abelian group with respect to its given multiplication.

The Lean statement, however, returns a value of type `CommGroup G`, which is a structure containing a (possibly new) multiplication, identity, inverse, and proofs of the group axioms plus commutativity. Importantly, this does not assert that the existing `[Group G]` structure is commutative; it could be defining a completely different commutative group structure on the same underlying type G. Thus, it does not express that ""the given group structure on G is abelian.""

A faithful formalization would assert, for the existing `Group` structure, a proposition such as `IsCommutative G (· * ·)` or `IsAbelian G` or `∀ a b, a * b = b * a`, not produce an arbitrary `CommGroup G` structure.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: The given group structure on G (with |G| = 5) is abelian.
- Lean code: Exhibits some commutative group structure on G under the assumption |G| = 5, not necessarily the same as the original `[Group G]` structure.
These are different statements. Therefore, the translation is not faithful, even though it's close in spirit.

No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; the mismatch is in the target type (`CommGroup G` vs. a proposition about the existing operation). The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for the audit, as we only check statement translation, not proofs.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the math library.
- Docstring: Clearly states the intended theorem: if G is a nonabelian group of order 6, then G is isomorphic to S3, represented as the permutation group on three letters `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`.
- `theorem group_of_order_6_noncomm_is_S3 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: Let G be a type with a group structure and finite (Fintype) structure.
- `(hcard : Fintype.card G = 6)`: Hypothesis that the order of G is 6.
- `(hnon : ∃ a b : G, a * b ≠ b * a)`: Hypothesis that G is noncommutative (nonabelian): there exist elements a, b that do not commute.
- `: Nonempty (MulEquiv G (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))`: Conclusion: there exists a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between G and the permutation group on 3 letters, i.e., S3.
- `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted; acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asserts: If G is a nonabelian group of order 6, then G ≅ S3.
- The Lean statement assumes G is a finite group with card 6 and is nonabelian (via existence of noncommuting elements), and concludes the existence of a multiplicative equivalence to `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`, which is the standard Lean representation of S3. Using `MulEquiv` in the context of groups is the standard notion of group isomorphism in Mathlib. Thus, the Lean theorem precisely encodes the statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The only objects used are standard Mathlib concepts.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same: the hypotheses match (order 6, nonabelian), and the conclusion matches (isomorphic to S3). There are no extraneous assumptions or weakenings/strengthenings. Using `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)` is a faithful representation of S3.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's topology and set theory framework.
- `def example_set : Set (Real × Real) := { p | p.1 * p.1 + p.2 * p.2 ≤ 1 } ∪ { p | (p.1 - 2) * (p.1 - 2) + p.2 * p.2 ≤ 1 }`:
  This defines a subset of R^2 (as pairs of reals), namely the union of two closed unit disks: one centered at (0,0), the other at (2,0). The inequalities are the usual closed disk equations.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_57 : IsConnected example_set ∧ ¬ IsConnected (interior example_set) := by sorry`:
  States that the set `example_set` is connected, and its interior is not connected. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation checking.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show that even if S is connected, it is not generally true that its interior is connected, i.e., one should provide a counterexample: a connected set whose interior is disconnected. The Lean code presents a concrete example in R^2 (two tangent closed unit disks) and asserts exactly that it is connected whereas its interior is not connected. This is a stronger, explicit instantiation of the requested counterexample, thus faithful.

3) Final comparison:
- Natural language: There exists a connected set S with disconnected interior.
- Lean: Exhibits a specific S in R^2 (the union of two tangent closed disks) and asserts `IsConnected S ∧ ¬ IsConnected (interior S)`.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; the definitions are standard. The code is a direct, concrete formalization of the existence claim. Therefore, the two are essentially the same, with the Lean code providing a specific example.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set` bring in Mathlib and set-theoretic notation.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]` sets up a general group G.
- The theorem statement:
  `(Subgroup.centralizer ({x⁻¹ * a * x} : Set G) : Set G)` is the underlying set of the subgroup of G consisting of all elements that commute with the single element `x⁻¹ * a * x`. This is exactly the centralizer C(x⁻¹ a x).
  The right-hand side `(fun y => x⁻¹ * y * x) '' (Subgroup.centralizer ({a} : Set G) : Set G)` is the image of the centralizer of `{a}` (i.e., C(a)) under the map `y ↦ x⁻¹ y x`, i.e., conjugation by x. This set is precisely the conjugate set `x⁻¹ C(a) x`.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement is: For a group G and a, x ∈ G, C(x⁻¹ a x) = x⁻¹ C(a) x. The Lean statement asserts equality of sets between the centralizer of the singleton `{x⁻¹ * a * x}` and the conjugate image of the centralizer of `{a}`. This is exactly the same mathematical content, with the centralizer taken as a subgroup but compared via their underlying sets. The map `y ↦ x⁻¹ y x` is the usual conjugation by x.

3) Final check of differences:
- The Lean code uses equality of sets (underlying sets of subgroups), while the natural language statement uses equality of subgroups/sets abstractly. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; Mathlib's `Subgroup.centralizer` is used legitimately.
Hence, the Lean code faithfully formalizes the given statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_6_15 {G : Type _} [CommGroup G] {m n : ℕ} {a b : G}`: Let G be an abelian group, m,n natural numbers, and a,b elements of G.
- Hypotheses for a: `ha_pow : a ^ m = 1` and `ha_min : ∀ k, 0 < k → k < m → a ^ k ≠ 1`. This encodes that a has order exactly m (i.e., a^m = 1 and no smaller positive exponent gives 1), except that the code does not assert m > 0 explicitly.
- Hypotheses for b: `hb_pow : b ^ n = 1` and `hb_min : ∀ k, 0 < k → k < n → b ^ k ≠ 1`. Similarly, b has order exactly n, except no explicit n > 0.
- `gcd1 : Nat.gcd m n = 1`: m and n are coprime.
- Conclusion: `∃ x : G, x ^ (m * n) = 1 ∧ (∀ k, 0 < k → k < m * n → x ^ k ≠ 1)`. There exists x in G of order exactly m*n (again, formulated via the standard minimality condition, but without explicitly asserting m*n > 0).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: If G is abelian and has elements of orders m and n with gcd(m,n)=1, then G has an element of order mn.
- The Lean statement mirrors this structure: abelian group; given elements a and b with orders m and n (via the minimality conditions) and gcd(m,n)=1; conclude existence of x with order mn.
- One technical omission: the code does not assume 0 < m and 0 < n. In standard mathematics, ""order m"" means m is a positive integer. Without 0 < m and 0 < n, edge cases like m = 0, n = 1 satisfy `gcd1` and make the hypotheses for a vacuous (since `a^0 = 1` is always true and the minimality condition is vacuous), so the premise no longer accurately expresses ""a has order m"". Similarly, the conclusion permits m*n = 0, which would not match ""order mn"" in the usual sense.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Same core mathematical content except for missing positivity assumptions on m and n (and implicitly on m*n in the conclusion). This is a minor but real discrepancy that affects edge cases. Aside from that, the translation is accurate: CommGroup matches abelian; coprime encoded with `Nat.gcd m n = 1`; existence of an element with exact order m*n expressed via the usual minimality property.

Verdict: Almost faithful, but not completely due to missing 0 < m and 0 < n. Adding these would make it faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: Bring in Mathlib and open the Polynomial namespace; no mathematical content change.
- Comment: States the exercise: for prime p, q(x) = 1 + x + ... + x^{p-1} is irreducible in Q[x].
- Theorem statement:
  - `(p : Nat) (hp : Nat.Prime p)`: p is a natural number with a proof that p is prime.
  - Goal: `Irreducible ((Finset.sum (Finset.range p) fun i => Polynomial.X ^ i) : Polynomial Rat)`.
    - `Finset.range p` is {0, 1, ..., p-1}.
    - Summing `X ^ i` over that range gives 1 + X + X^2 + ... + X^{p-1}.
    - The type ascription `: Polynomial Rat` specifies coefficients in Q (rationals).
    - `Irreducible` is irreducible in Q[x].
- `by sorry`: no proof provided; irrelevant to translation faithfulness.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural statement: If p is prime, q(x) = 1 + x + ... + x^{p-1} is irreducible in Q[x].
- Lean statement precisely asserts: for prime natural p, the polynomial sum_{i=0}^{p-1} X^i, viewed as a polynomial over Rat, is irreducible.
- This matches exactly.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- Domain: Q[x] vs Polynomial Rat — identical.
- Polynomial: 1 + x + ... + x^{p-1} matches the sum over range p of X^i.
- Hypothesis: p is prime — matches `Nat.Prime p`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no red flags. Slight technical detail: p is Nat (nonnegative integers) which is standard for primes; primes in Nat are ≥ 2, so the sum is as intended.
- Therefore the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: The set of real quaternions q such that q * q = -1 is infinite. Here `Quaternion ℝ` denotes Hamilton's quaternions over ℝ, `q * q` is q squared (q^2), and `(-1 : Quaternion ℝ)` is the quaternion corresponding to −1 via the canonical embedding ℝ → ℍ. `Set.Infinite` asserts that this set has infinitely many elements.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language states: “Show that there is an infinite number of solutions to x^2 = −1 in the quaternions.” The Lean statement asserts exactly that: the set of q in Quaternion ℝ with q^2 = −1 is infinite. The use of `q * q` instead of `q^2` is standard and equivalent, and the coercion of −1 into quaternions is appropriate.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Both are in the quaternions over ℝ.
- Equation: x^2 = −1 matches q * q = −1.
- Quantification: “infinite number of solutions” matches `Set.Infinite` of the solution set.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem signature with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation assessment.
No discrepancies found. The translation is faithful.

  Natural language: For any type G equipped with a group structure and which is finite, if the cardinality of G is even, then there exists an element g in G whose order is 2. Here `orderOf g = 2` is the standard Mathlib encoding that g has order 2.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that a group of even order contains an element of order 2.""
- Lean: Exactly states that for a finite group (Fintype G) with even cardinality (Even (Fintype.card G)), there exists g with orderOf g = 2.
- This is a faithful formalization of the statement (Cauchy's theorem for p=2), with the expected finiteness and evenness assumptions encoded precisely.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No additional or missing assumptions beyond standard formalization (finiteness and even cardinality).
- The target conclusion is exactly existence of an element of order 2, encoded as `orderOf g = 2`.

  This declares a theorem stating: The real number `Real.cos (Real.pi / (180 : ℝ))` is algebraic over `ℚ`. In words, cos(π/180) is algebraic over the rationals. Since angles in Lean's `Real.cos` are in radians, `π/180` radians corresponds exactly to 1 degree, so this is cos 1°.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that cos 1° is algebraic over ℚ.” The Lean statement asserts `IsAlgebraic ℚ (Real.cos (Real.pi / (180 : ℝ)))`, which is precisely that cos(1°) (interpreted as cos(π/180) radians) is algebraic over ℚ. This is a direct and faithful translation.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Field: Uses ℝ for cos; the statement asks for algebraic over ℚ, which is exactly `IsAlgebraic ℚ` in ℝ. This matches standard usage.

  This declares a definition (equivalently, a theorem statement with a specified output) that for any two types G and H equipped with group structures and finite-type instances, assuming their cardinalities are 21 and they are nonabelian, produces a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between G and H.

  - `(nG : ¬ (∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x))` and `(nH : ¬ (∀ x y : H, x * y = y * x))`: both groups are nonabelian (not commutative).
- Conclusion: `MulEquiv G H`, i.e., a group isomorphism between G and H.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that any two nonabelian groups of order 21 are isomorphic."" The Lean signature universally quantifies over all groups G and H with order 21 and noncommutative law, and asserts the existence (indeed provides a term) of a group isomorphism `MulEquiv G H`. This directly formalizes the statement. Using `MulEquiv` is the standard Mathlib notion of group isomorphism. The nonabelian condition is correctly encoded as `¬ ∀ x y, x * y = y * x`. No extraneous assumptions are present.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code is a direct formalization of the claim. It is slightly stronger in that it is phrased as a dependent function returning an isomorphism given the hypotheses, but this is a standard constructive formulation of an existence statement and is acceptable.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are used; there is only a single statement with `by sorry` (proof omitted), which is fine for translation auditing.

Here, `Irreducible` is Mathlib’s standard notion of irreducibility in the ring Polynomial ℚ, and `Set.Infinite` asserts the set is infinite.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `F` is a type with `[Field F]` and `[Infinite F]`, so F is an infinite field. `V` is a type with `[AddCommGroup V]` and `[Module F V]`, so V is a vector space over F.
- Statement: For any natural number `n` and any family `s : Fin n → Submodule F V` (i.e., a finite collection of subspaces of V indexed by `Fin n`), if each is proper (`∀ i, s i ≠ ⊤`), then there exists a vector `v : V` such that `∀ i : Fin n, v ∉ (s i : Set V)`. That is, v is not in any of the subspaces `s i`.

Interpretation:
- This means there is an element of V that lies outside the union of these finitely many proper subspaces. Equivalently, the union of finitely many proper subspaces is a proper subset of V, i.e., V cannot equal that union.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""Let V be a vector space over an infinite field F. Show that V cannot be the set-theoretic union of a finite number of proper subspaces of V.""
- The Lean statement precisely formalizes this: for any finite family of proper submodules (subspaces), there exists an element of V outside all of them, hence V is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.
- The use of `Submodule F V` matches subspaces. Properness is encoded by `s i ≠ ⊤`. Finite family is encoded via indexing by `Fin n`. The conclusion uses existence of a vector outside the union, which is equivalent to the space not being equal to the union.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. The presence of `sorry` pertains only to the proof and is not relevant to the fidelity of the statement translation per the auditing guidelines.

Final check:
- The formal statement is a faithful and standard formalization of the natural language claim. No discrepancies found.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. 
- The assumptions (finite group of order p^2, p prime) and the conclusion (existence of a normal subgroup of order p) align exactly. 
- No extra conditions or weakenings are present. The formalization is a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- `/-- If every element of a ring R satisfies x^3 = x, then R is commutative. -/` is a docstring summarizing the intended statement.
- `def herstein_exercise_4_2_5 {R : Type _} [Ring R] (h : ∀ x : R, x ^ 3 = x) : CommRing R := by sorry`
  This declares a definition which, given a type `R` equipped with a ring structure `[Ring R]` and a hypothesis `h` that every element satisfies `x^3 = x`, produces a term of type `CommRing R`. In Lean, `CommRing R` is a structure giving a commutative ring structure on `R` (including the operations and proofs of axioms). The `by sorry` means the construction/proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let R be a ring in which x^3 = x for every x ∈ R. Prove that R is commutative.” This means: with the existing ring operations on `R`, multiplication is commutative, i.e., `∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a`.
- The Lean statement concludes `CommRing R`. This asserts the existence of a commutative ring structure on the underlying type `R`. Crucially, this does not assert that the multiplication of the given ring structure `[Ring R]` is commutative; it could, in principle, furnish a different set of operations that make `R` into a commutative ring. Because `CommRing R` is a structure (data), not merely the proposition that `*` is commutative for the already given `*`, this does not guarantee commutativity of the existing multiplication.
- A faithful formalization would assert commutativity of the existing multiplication, e.g. `theorem ... : ∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a` or `IsCommutative R (· * ·)`. Alternatively, one could construct a `CommRing` structure that explicitly extends the given `[Ring R]` (ensuring the same operations), but this is not expressed by the current type of the definition.

3) Final check — same or different problems?
- Different. The Lean code claims the existence of some commutative ring structure on the type `R`, whereas the natural language demands that the given ring structure on `R` is commutative. The code does not enforce that the produced `CommRing R` uses the same operations as the existing `[Ring R]`.

No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the only issue is the mismatch in the exact formal target. A more faithful Lean statement would be one of:
- `theorem comm_of_cube_id (h : ∀ x : R, x ^ 3 = x) : ∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a := ...`
- `theorem comm_of_cube_id (h : ∀ x : R, x ^ 3 = x) : IsCommutative R (· * ·) := ...`

Therefore, the translation is not faithful, though it is very close in intent.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def von_mangoldt (n : ℕ) : Real := if h : ∃ p k, Nat.Prime p ∧ 1 ≤ k ∧ n = p ^ k then Real.log ((Classical.choose h : ℕ) : Real) else 0`
  This defines the von Mangoldt function Λ(n): it is log p if n is a positive power p^k (k ≥ 1) of a prime p, and 0 otherwise. The use of `Classical.choose` selects the prime p from the existential witness; since the prime is unique when such a representation exists, this defines Λ(n) as intended.

- `def divisors (n : ℕ) : Finset ℕ := (Finset.range (n + 1)).filter fun d => d ∣ n`
  This defines the finite set of (nonnegative) divisors of n up to n. For n ≥ 1, this is the usual set of positive divisors {d | d ∣ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ n}. For n = 0, this finset includes 0 (since 0 ∣ 0), which is a slight deviation from the usual “positive divisors” convention.

- `variable (μ : ℕ → Real)` introduces an arbitrary function μ: ℕ → ℝ.

- The theorem `mobius_inversion_log`:
  Hypotheses:
  • `h_mu : ∀ n, ∑_{d∈divisors n} μ d = if n = 1 then 1 else 0` — this is the Möbius identity μ * 1 = ε, characterizing the Möbius function by its Dirichlet inverse property.
  • `h_log : ∀ n, ∑_{d∈divisors n} von_mangoldt d = Real.log n` — the standard identity log n = ∑_{d|n} Λ(d).
  Conclusion:
  • `∀ n, ∑_{d∈divisors n} μ (n / d) * Real.log d = von_mangoldt n` — i.e., Λ(n) = ∑_{d|n} μ(n/d) log d. This is precisely the Möbius inversion of the identity in h_log, using μ as the inverse of 1.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural-language statement?
- The natural statement: Define Λ(n) = log p if n is a power of p, else 0. Prove that ∑_{d|n} μ(n/d) log d = Λ(n).
- The code defines Λ exactly in this way, and the concluding equality matches the target identity. The code keeps μ abstract but assumes the Möbius identity (which is the defining property of the Möbius function) and assumes the standard preliminary identity log n = ∑_{d|n} Λ(d). With these, the conclusion is exactly the claimed formula.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The theorem is stated under explicit hypotheses: (i) the Möbius identity for μ and (ii) the divisor-sum identity for log and Λ. The natural statement names μ as the Möbius function and expects proving the identity; using these two standard facts is exactly the usual route via Möbius inversion. Treating μ abstractly with the Möbius identity is a slight generalization but faithful.
- Minor technical divergence: `divisors 0` includes 0, so the theorem also allows n = 0; the usual number-theoretic statement is for n ≥ 1. This is a benign extension; the assumptions ensure the identity still holds for n = 0 under the given definitions.
- No vacuous placeholders: von_mangoldt and divisors are concrete definitions; the theorem’s proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed for translation auditing.

Overall, the code faithfully captures the statement (with standard auxiliary assumptions made explicit) and matches the mathematical content of the original claim.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- K is a field; V is a K-vector space.
- ι is an index set and b : ι → V is a family of vectors in V.
- hb_span and hb_ind assert that the set {b i | i ∈ ι} spans V and is linearly independent; i.e., b is a basis of V indexed by ι.
- T, S are linear endomorphisms of V.
- lam, mu : ι → K are functions assigning scalars to indices.
- hT: for every i, T(b i) = lam i • b i. So each b i is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue lam i.
- hS: for every i, S(b i) = mu i • b i. So each b i is also an eigenvector of S (with possibly different eigenvalue mu i).
- hdistinct: lam is injective on ι, i.e., the distinct basis vectors b i correspond to distinct eigenvalues of T. Thus T has |ι| distinct eigenvalues, one per basis vector.
- Goal: S.comp T = T.comp S, i.e., ST = TS.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: T has dim V distinct eigenvalues; S has the same eigenvectors as T (not necessarily the same eigenvalues). Conclude ST = TS.
- The code captures: there is a basis b of V consisting of eigenvectors of T with pairwise distinct eigenvalues (hdistinct), and the same basis b consists of eigenvectors of S (hS), possibly with different eigenvalues mu. This is exactly the common-eigenbasis situation. Since the basis spans V, T and S are diagonal in the same basis; hence they commute.
- The condition “dim V distinct eigenvalues” matches “hdistinct” together with b being a basis: each eigenspace is one-dimensional and we have as many distinct eigenvalues as the dimension. The existence of b as an eigenbasis is a standard consequence of that hypothesis, and the code takes it explicitly as input, which is a faithful formalization.
- “S has the same eigenvectors as T” is rendered as: for each eigenvector b i of T, b i is also an eigenvector of S (hS). Given T has simple spectrum, the set of eigenvectors of T is exactly the union of the one-dimensional lines spanned by the b i, so this matches the intended meaning. Even if one interprets “same eigenvectors” as equality of the sets of eigenvectors, the code uses the necessary part (every T-eigenvector is an S-eigenvector) which is implied by the statement; this suffices to conclude commuting.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all objects are standard Mathlib constructs. The theorem statement matches the mathematical meaning: over a field, with a basis of common eigenvectors (T having distinct eigenvalues across the basis), conclude ST = TS.
- The code slightly generalizes to possibly infinite index ι, but this is harmless and common in formalizations; the content is still faithful. The conclusion ST = TS matches exactly S.comp T = T.comp S.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- The theorem statement `herstein_exercise_4_2_9 (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hpodd : p ≠ 2) (a b : Int)` introduces a natural number `p` with the hypothesis that `p` is prime and `p ≠ 2` (so p is an odd prime), and integers `a, b`.
- The hypothesis `h : (Finset.sum (Finset.range (p - 1)) fun k => (1 : Rat) / ((k : Rat) + 1)) = (a : Rat) / (b : Rat)` asserts that, as rationals, the sum ∑_{k=0}^{p-2} 1/(k+1) equals `a/b`. This is exactly the sum 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p-1) expressed in Rat.
- The conclusion `(p : Int) ∣ a` states that the integer `p` divides the integer `a` (with `p` coerced to an integer).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let p be an odd prime and let 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p - 1) = a/b (as rationals), where a, b are integers. Show that p divides a.
- Odd prime: encoded by `Nat.Prime p` and `p ≠ 2`.
- The sum equality is precisely encoded with `Rat` and the finite sum over k from 0 to p-2 of 1/(k+1), which is 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p-1).
- `a, b` are declared as integers, and the equality is taken in rationals, as requested.
- Conclusion `p | a` is captured by `(p : Int) ∣ a`.

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues
- The code does not require `b ≠ 0` or that the fraction is in lowest terms. The original statement also did not explicitly require reduced form, only that the equation holds “as rationals,” so this is fine.
- The sum limits and coercions are correct and match the intended series.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions: everything is standard Mathlib, and the theorem is posed directly.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- `(2)` is the ideal generated by the constant polynomial 2: `Ideal.span { (2 : Polynomial Int) }`.
- `(x)` is the ideal generated by X: `Ideal.span { Polynomial.X }`.

- `theorem artin_exercise_2_4_19 {G : Type*} [Group G] {a : G}`: We are working in an arbitrary group G with an element a.
- Hypotheses:
  - `ha_nonid : a ≠ 1`: a is not the identity.
  - `ha_sq : a * a = 1`: a squared is the identity; equivalently, a is an involution.
  - `h_unique : ∀ b : G, b * b = 1 → b = 1 ∨ b = a`: any element b with b^2 = 1 must be either the identity or a. This encodes the uniqueness of the nontrivial element with square 1.
- Conclusion:
  - `∀ g : G, a * g = g * a`: a commutes with every element g, i.e., a is central.

Assessment with the natural language statement:
- The phrase ""contains exactly one element of order 2"" in a group means there exists a unique element a with order exactly 2. In group theory, an element has order 2 precisely if it satisfies a ≠ 1 and a^2 = 1. The Lean hypotheses `ha_nonid` and `ha_sq` assert that a is such an element. The uniqueness is captured by `h_unique`, which says the only elements squaring to 1 are 1 and a; hence a is the unique non-identity involution, i.e., the unique element of order 2.
- The conclusion that ""that element is in the center"" is exactly expressed by `∀ g, a * g = g * a`.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization: it fixes the unique involution a and proves it commutes with all elements. There are no extraneous or vacuous definitions. The quantifications and conditions match the natural language statement precisely.

In other words, every pair of elements in the subgroup generated by a and b commute.
- This is exactly the statement that the subgroup generated by a and b is abelian.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let H be the subgroup generated by a and b in a group G. If ab = ba, then H is an abelian group. In formal terms, this means: for all x, y in H, xy = yx.
- The Lean code takes H to be `Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G)`, which is exactly the subgroup generated by a and b in Mathlib. The conclusion is that any x, y in this closure commute. This matches the definition of H being abelian.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code expresses the property ""H is abelian"" as a universally quantified commutativity statement over elements of H via membership conditions, rather than declaring an instance or a proposition like `IsCommutative H` or `Subgroup.IsAbelian`. This is logically equivalent to the natural language assertion.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The code directly states the theorem.

- Comment: ""If a prime integer p has the form 2^r + 1, then r is a power of 2, i.e. p = 2^{2^k} + 1 for some k.""
- Theorem statement: `theorem Artin_exercise_13_4_10 (p r : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (h : p = 2 ^ r + 1) : ∃ k : ℕ, p = 2 ^ (2 ^ k) + 1 := by sorry`
  This says: For natural numbers p and r, if p is prime and p = 2^r + 1, then there exists a natural number k such that p = 2^{2^k} + 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that if a prime integer p has the form 2^r + 1, then it actually has the form 2^{2^k}+1.""
- The classical precise statement requires r > 0 (or r ≥ 1). The standard theorem: If 2^r + 1 is prime and r > 0, then r is a power of 2. The Lean code does not include the hypothesis r > 0; it allows r = 0.

3) Comparison and discrepancy:
- If r = 0, then h gives p = 2^0 + 1 = 2, which is prime. But there is no k with 2 = 2^{2^k} + 1 (since the smallest is for k=0 yielding 3). Hence the Lean theorem as stated is false in the r = 0 case.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly stronger than (and not equivalent to) the intended theorem; it is missing the necessary condition r > 0.
- Apart from this, the types and notions (Nat.Prime, powers, existence of k) are correct and non-vacuous.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation because it omits the essential hypothesis r > 0. Everything else matches the intended meaning.

2) Faithfulness check:
The natural language statement asserts that addition in the quotient ring Z/nZ is associative. The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: it states associativity of `+` in `ZMod n` for arbitrary `n` and arbitrary elements. `ZMod n` is Mathlib's standard type for Z/nZ. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final comparison:
The two statements match. The Lean version is a direct formalization. It even covers the edge case `n = 0` (where `ZMod 0 ≅ ℤ`), which still satisfies associativity, so it is a harmless generalization consistent with the original intent. No discrepancies found.

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib. No mathematical content beyond enabling standard definitions like groups and `orderOf`.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem dummit_foote_exercise_1_1_22a {G : Type _} [Group G] (x g : G) : orderOf x = orderOf (g⁻¹ * x * g) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G equipped with a group structure, and any elements x and g in G, the order of x equals the order of the conjugate g⁻¹ x g. Here `orderOf` is Mathlib's notion of the order of an element (a natural number, with 0 representing infinite order), and `g⁻¹ * x * g` is the conjugate of x by g in multiplicative notation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: If x and g are elements of a group G, then |x| = |g^{-1} x g|. This exactly matches the theorem’s statement: equality of the order of x and its conjugate by g.
- The use of Mathlib’s `orderOf` (Nat, with 0 for infinite order) is a standard formalization. Since the claim is an equality of orders, this encoding is faithful to the intended meaning (finite or infinite), so there is no substantive discrepancy.
- The group context `[Group G]` and the elements `(x g : G)` match the informal statement precisely.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the task’s instructions.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content is the same: equality of order of an element and its conjugate in a group. No extra hypotheses or restrictions, no generalization beyond what’s intended.
- Notational match: `g⁻¹ * x * g` is exactly `g^{-1} x g`.
- Minor technicality: `orderOf` returns a Nat with 0 for infinite order, but equality is preserved; this is a standard formalization and does not change the meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_8 (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (n : ℕ) : Irreducible (Polynomial.X ^ n - Polynomial.C (p : ℚ)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number p which is prime (Nat.Prime p) and any natural number n, the polynomial X^n − C(p) over ℚ[x] is irreducible. Here, `Polynomial.C (p : ℚ)` is the constant polynomial p in ℚ[x], so the statement is: For all n ∈ ℕ, the polynomial x^n − p is irreducible in ℚ[x]. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The intended statement: “Let p be a prime integer. Prove that the polynomial x^n − p is irreducible in ℚ[x].” In standard math usage, this implicitly assumes n ≥ 1. The irreducibility is classical via Eisenstein with prime p.
- The Lean statement quantifies over all `n : ℕ` without restriction, thus includes n = 0. For n = 0, the polynomial is x^0 − p = 1 − p, a nonzero constant, which is a unit in ℚ[x]; hence it is not irreducible. Therefore the Lean statement is false for n = 0 and does not match the intended claim.
- The coefficient ring is ℚ correctly captured by `(p : ℚ)` and hence the polynomial lives in `Polynomial ℚ`.
- The parameter `p : ℕ` with `Nat.Prime p` is a reasonable formalization of “prime integer”, since primes in ℤ are associates of natural primes; this is a mild specialization but acceptable.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Difference: The Lean code omits the necessary hypothesis n ≥ 1 (or equivalently `n ≠ 0`), making the formal statement strictly stronger (and in fact false) at n = 0. Everything else (prime p, ring ℚ[x], polynomial x^n − p) matches. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the task.

Conclusion: Near miss due to the missing condition on n. To be faithful, the theorem should assume `0 < n`.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_16 {G : Type _} [Group G] (x : G) : x ^ 2 = 1 ↔ orderOf x = 1 ∨ orderOf x = 2 := by sorry`
  This states: For any type `G` with a group structure and any element `x : G`, we have an equivalence: `x^2 = 1` if and only if `orderOf x = 1` or `orderOf x = 2`. Here `1` is the group identity, and `orderOf x : ℕ` is the (finite) order of `x` if it exists, and `0` if the order is infinite. The statement `orderOf x = 1 ∨ orderOf x = 2` says the order is either 1 or 2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""Let x be an element of G. Prove that x^2=1 if and only if |x| is either 1 or 2."" In Lean, `orderOf x` corresponds to `|x|`, the order of the element. Thus the formal statement exactly matches: `x ^ 2 = 1 ↔ orderOf x = 1 ∨ orderOf x = 2`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Context: Group `G` and element `x` — matches.
- Condition: `x^2 = 1` — matches.
- Conclusion: order of `x` is 1 or 2 — matches `orderOf x = 1 ∨ orderOf x = 2`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the presence of `sorry` only omits the proof and does not alter the statement.
There are no substantive differences. The translation is faithful.

  Translation: Let G be a finite group of order |G| = p*m with p a prime and p not dividing m. Let H be a subgroup of G of order p. Then for every group automorphism φ of G (φ : G ≃* G), the image of H under φ, as a set, equals H itself: φ '' H = H. This expresses that H is invariant under all automorphisms, i.e., H is characteristic.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Suppose |G| = p m with p prime and p ∤ m. If H is a normal subgroup of order p, prove H is characteristic.
- Lean code: Assumes |G| = p m, p prime, p ∤ m, and H is a subgroup of order p (no normality hypothesis). Concludes that for all automorphisms φ, φ(H) = H as sets.
- This matches the desired conclusion “H is characteristic” (invariance under all automorphisms). The use of equality of images as sets is a standard formalization of characteristic. The only difference is that the code omits the normality hypothesis. This is a benign (and correct) generalization because, under the given group order constraints, any subgroup of order p is the unique Sylow p-subgroup, hence normal and characteristic. Thus the code proves a stronger statement than requested, which is acceptable per the guidelines for slight generalizations.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Assumptions: The code has weaker assumptions (does not require H normal). The rest (|G| = p m, p prime, p ∤ m, |H| = p) matches.
- Conclusion: The code concludes H is invariant under all automorphisms, i.e., characteristic. This matches the natural language goal.
- No vacuous placeholders: All terms are standard Mathlib constructs (Group, Fintype, Subgroup, G ≃* G, Set.image). No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced.

Therefore, the code is a faithful (slightly stronger) formalization of the statement.

  ∀ (g : G) {h : G}, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H := by sorry
",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: G is a finite group.
- `variable {p n : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hG : Fintype.card G = p ^ n)`: p is a prime natural number and |G| = p^n. These are declared as variables but are not used in the theorem statement.
- `variable (H : Subgroup G) [Fintype H] (hH : Fintype.card H = p ^ (n - 1))`: H is a subgroup of G with finite cardinality |H| = p^(n-1). Again, these are declared but not used in the theorem statement, except that H itself appears.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_11_22 : ∀ (g : G) {h : G}, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H := by sorry`: For all g in G and h in G with h ∈ H, the conjugate g h g⁻¹ is in H. This is exactly the standard characterization of H being normal in G.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: ""Show that any subgroup of order p^{n-1} in a group G of order p^n is normal in G."" The intended formalization should assert normality of H under the assumptions that p is prime, |G| = p^n, and |H| = p^(n-1). In Lean, this could be phrased as `H.Normal` or equivalently `∀ g, ∀ h ∈ H, g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H`, but crucially under the listed hypotheses.

However, the given theorem statement does not include the hypotheses `hp`, `hG`, or `hH` in its type. The only parameter that appears in the statement is H itself. Thus the theorem as stated claims: for this fixed subgroup H of G, for all g and h with h ∈ H, we have g h g⁻¹ ∈ H — i.e., H is normal — with no dependence on p, n, or the cardinalities. This overgeneralizes to ""every subgroup H of G is normal,"" which is false and does not match the intended statement.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are different. The code omits the essential hypotheses about the orders of G and H and the primality of p. The conclusion (normality) is expressed correctly, but without the required conditions, making the formal statement not faithful to the original.

No vacuous or fake definitions are used; the issue is the missing hypotheses from the theorem statement. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The docstring describes the theorem in natural language: In a commutative ring R, an ideal M with the property that every element not in M is a unit is maximal and unique among maximal ideals.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_10_7_10 {R : Type _} [CommRing R] (M : Ideal R)`: Let R be a commutative ring and M an ideal of R.
- `(h : ∀ x : R, x ∉ M → IsUnit x)`: Hypothesis: For every x in R, if x is not in M, then x is a unit.
- `: Ideal.IsMaximal M ∧ (∀ N : Ideal R, Ideal.IsMaximal N → N = M)`: Conclusion: M is a maximal ideal and for any ideal N, if N is maximal, then N = M (i.e., M is the unique maximal ideal).
- `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted. This does not affect the statement's faithfulness.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: Let R be a ring, M an ideal. If every element not in M is a unit, then M is maximal and moreover the only maximal ideal.
- Lean statement mirrors this exactly, with the standard Mathlib notions: `Ideal.IsMaximal`, `IsUnit`, and quantification over ideals for uniqueness.

Step 3: Compare for differences.
- The only difference is that the Lean code assumes `[CommRing R]` (commutative ring), whereas the natural language says “ring” without specifying. In many contexts, “ring” is assumed commutative with 1; even if the original intended the commutative setting, this is a standard and acceptable slight specialization. No other discrepancies.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; standard Mathlib concepts are used.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with at most a benign specialization to commutative rings.

  This sets up: G is a finite group, p and q are natural numbers with `Nat.Prime p` and `Nat.Prime q`, and the order of G is p^2 * q.
- Conclusion: `∃ H : Subgroup G, H ≠ ⊥ ∧ H ≠ ⊤ ∧ ∀ (g x : G), x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H`.
  This asserts there exists a subgroup H of G such that H is nontrivial (`H ≠ ⊥`), proper (`H ≠ ⊤`), and normal in G (the displayed closure under conjugation: for all g in G and x in H, g x g⁻¹ is in H).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: ""Prove that no group of order p^2 q, where p and q are prime, is simple."" A group is simple iff it has no nontrivial proper normal subgroup. The Lean statement produces a nontrivial proper normal subgroup (H ≠ ⊥, H ≠ ⊤, and closed under conjugation) for any finite group G with |G| = p^2 q. Hence it exactly formalizes ""G is not simple.""

3) Final comparison:
- Quantifiers and hypotheses match: finite group, order p^2 q, p and q primes. The code does not require p ≠ q, and the natural statement also does not; the claim remains true even if p = q.
- The property ensuring non-simplicity (existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup) is stated explicitly in the conclusion.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions; no placeholders except for the proof `sorry`, which is acceptable per instructions since we only audit the statement.
Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

  - The theorem asserts two equivalences: (1) xy = yx ↔ y⁻¹ x y = x, and (2) y⁻¹ x y = x ↔ x⁻¹ y⁻¹ x y = 1.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language “xy = yx iff y^{-1} x y = x iff x^{-1} y^{-1} x y = 1” indicates a chain of equivalences among three statements A, B, C, which is standardly formalized as (A ↔ B) ∧ (B ↔ C). That is exactly what the Lean statement presents.

- There are no discrepancies in quantification, structures, or statements. The conjunction of the two iff statements captures the intended triple equivalence.

  Natural language: For any group G and any subgroup H of G, the subgroup generated by the set H \ {1} is equal to H. Here `↑H` is H viewed as a subset of G, `{1}` is the singleton containing the identity element of G, `\` is set difference, and `Subgroup.closure` is the subgroup generated by a set.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:

- In Lean, ""generated by"" is exactly captured by `Subgroup.closure` of a set. The set `H − {1}` is represented as `↑H \ {1}`. The equality to `H` expresses that the subgroup generated by that set is precisely H. Thus the Lean statement matches the natural language statement directly.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated exactly as the natural language claim. There are no differences in quantification or structure; it is neither a specialization nor a generalization beyond the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: We work with an arbitrary group G.
- `def center (G : Type _) [Group G] : Set G := { z | ∀ g : G, z * g = g * z }`: Defines Z = center(G) as the set of elements commuting with every element of G. This matches the standard notion of the center.
- Theorem statement:
  Hypothesis `h : ∃ g0 : G, ∀ a : G, ∃ n : Int, ∃ z : G, z ∈ center G ∧ a = g0 ^ n * z` means: There exists an element g0 in G such that for every a in G, there exists an integer n and a central element z with a = g0^n z. Equivalently, in the quotient G/Z, the coset aZ equals (g0Z)^n, so G/Z is cyclic generated by g0Z.
  Conclusion: `(∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a) ∧ center G = Set.univ`. The first conjunct says G is abelian. The second says the center of G equals all of G (i.e., Z = G).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement
- The natural language statement: ""Let Z be the center of a group G. If G/Z is cyclic, then G is abelian and hence G = Z."" 
- The Lean hypothesis precisely encodes that G/Z is cyclic via the existence of g0 with every a lying in g0^n Z, i.e., a = g0^n z with z central. The conclusions are exactly that G is abelian and therefore Z = G, expressed as center G = Set.univ.

3) Final check for differences
- The custom definition of center as a set is standard and correct. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.
- The use of Int exponents correctly handles general cyclic groups (finite or infinite) in the quotient.
- No extraneous strengthening or weakening: the hypothesis is exactly ""G/Z is cyclic""; the conclusions match ""G is abelian and hence G = Z"".
- Minor formalization detail: they avoid quotient groups by encoding coset equality as existence of a central z with a = g0^n z, which is mathematically equivalent.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Artin_exercise_3_5_6 {K : Type*} [Field K] {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]` sets up K as a field and V as a K-vector space.
- `(S : Set V) (hS_countable : Set.Countable S) (hS_span : Submodule.span K S = ⊤)` introduces a subset S of V which is countable and spans V (i.e., span S = the whole space).
- `(T : Set V) (hT_linind : LinearIndependent K (fun x : Subtype T => (x : V)))` introduces a subset T of V which is linearly independent (by expressing linear independence of the coercion from the subtype T to V).
- Conclusion: `Set.Finite T ∨ Set.Countable T` says T is finite or countable.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If V is spanned by a countably infinite set, then every linearly independent subset of V is finite or countably infinite.
- The code assumes S is countable (not necessarily infinite) and spans V, and concludes any linearly independent T is finite or countable. In Mathlib, `Set.Countable` includes finite sets, so the conclusion ""finite or countable"" is equivalent to ""finite or countably infinite"" overall (since finite ∪ countably infinite = countable). The code’s form of linear independence for a subset via `LinearIndependent K (fun x : Subtype T => (x : V))` is the standard encoding that T is linearly independent as a subset.
- The only deviation is that the code allows S to be finite as well as countably infinite. This is a slight generalization that still implies the intended statement; if V is spanned by a countably infinite set, it certainly satisfies the code’s hypotheses. This is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumption difference: natural statement specifies ""countably infinite"" spanning set; code assumes ""countable"" (possibly finite). This is a benign generalization and does not weaken the intended result.
- Conclusion phrasing: natural says ""finite or countably infinite""; code says ""finite or countable"". These are logically equivalent in this context since countable = finite ∪ countably infinite.
- Quantification and objects match (vector space over a field, linearly independent subset, spanned by countable set).

Hence, the Lean statement is a faithful and slightly stronger formalization of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_10_4_6 {R : Type _} [CommRing R] (I J : Ideal R) (x : R) (hx : x ∈ I ⊓ J) :` declares a theorem for a commutative ring R, two ideals I and J of R, and an element x in R, with the hypothesis hx that x belongs to the intersection I ∩ J.
- `IsNilpotent (Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J) x)` states the conclusion: the image (residue) of x in the quotient ring R/(I*J) is nilpotent.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for translation checking since we only assess the statement.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""Let I, J be ideals in a ring R. Prove that the residue of any element of I ∩ J in R / I J is nilpotent.""
- The Lean statement asserts exactly that: for any x ∈ I ∩ J, its image in R/(I*J) is nilpotent.
- The formulation uses standard mathlib constructs: `I ⊓ J` for intersection, `I * J` for ideal product, and `Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J) x` for the residue of x in the quotient R ⧸ (I*J).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only difference is that the Lean code assumes R is a commutative ring (`[CommRing R]`), while the natural language says ""a ring R"" (not specifying commutativity). This is a mild specialization. The statement itself is correctly captured for the commutative case, and the translation is faithful to the intended mathematical content.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code relies entirely on mathlib's standard notions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization (slight specialization) of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- `theorem units_real_not_isomorphic_units_complex : ¬ Nonempty (MulEquiv (Units ℝ) (Units ℂ)) := by sorry`: States that there does not exist a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between `Units ℝ` and `Units ℂ`. In other words, the multiplicative groups of units of the real numbers and of the complex numbers are not isomorphic.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement claims: ""Prove that the multiplicative groups ℝ \ {0} and ℂ \ {0} are not isomorphic.""
- In a field (like ℝ and ℂ), the group of units is exactly the set of nonzero elements under multiplication. Thus `Units ℝ` is canonically isomorphic to the multiplicative group ℝ \ {0}, and `Units ℂ` to ℂ \ {0}.
- The Lean statement `¬ Nonempty (MulEquiv (Units ℝ) (Units ℂ))` is precisely saying ""there is no group isomorphism between ℝ \ {0} and ℂ \ {0}"" (using the standard identification via units). Using `Nonempty (MulEquiv ...)` to formalize “isomorphic” is standard in Mathlib.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given. Although the proof is omitted (`sorry`), we are auditing only the faithfulness of the statement.
- The only slight difference is the formalization via `Units` rather than the subtype `{x : ℝ // x ≠ 0}` or `{z : ℂ // z ≠ 0}`. For fields, these are canonically isomorphic as groups, so this is a faithful formalization, not a substantive change.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  Translation: For any group G and element x in G, assuming `orderOf x = 0` (in Mathlib, this denotes that x has infinite order), for all integers m and n, if m ≠ n then x^m ≠ x^n. The use of `Int` exponents means we are considering all integer powers, with the group structure providing zpow for negative exponents.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The hypothesis ""x is an element of infinite order"" is captured by `orderOf x = 0` in Mathlib.
- The conclusion ""the elements x^n, n ∈ ℤ are all distinct"" is exactly the pairwise inequality `∀ m n, m ≠ n → x^m ≠ x^n`.
- Exponents over ℤ are used, matching the natural language domain.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib definitions, including `ZMod` and `IsUnit`.
- Docstring: States the intended mathematics: For all n > 1, Z/nZ is not a group under multiplication of residue classes, expressed as the existence of a nonunit in `ZMod n` when `n > 1`.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_5 (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) : ∃ a : ZMod n, ¬ IsUnit (a : ZMod n) := by sorry`:
  This asserts: For a natural number n with 1 < n, there exists an element `a` in `ZMod n` that is not a unit (i.e., has no multiplicative inverse). No auxiliary definitions are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib notions: `ZMod n` for the ring of integers mod n and `IsUnit` for multiplicative invertibility.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that for all n > 1, Z/nZ is not a group under multiplication of residue classes.""
- Being a group under multiplication means every element is multiplicatively invertible. Saying ""Z/nZ is not a group under multiplication"" is equivalent to saying there exists an element that is not invertible (a nonunit). Thus the Lean statement ""∃ a : ZMod n, ¬ IsUnit a"" for `1 < n` is exactly the formalization of the given claim.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The existence of a nonunit in `ZMod n` for `n > 1` is equivalent to the failure of `ZMod n` to be a group under multiplication of all residue classes. There are no extraneous assumptions or vacuous placeholders. The use of `ZMod n` and `IsUnit` are standard and correct Mathlib notions. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are made.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem rotations_maximal {G : Type _} [Group G] (r s : G) (n : Nat) (hrn : r ^ n = 1) (hs2 : s ^ 2 = 1) (hconj : s * r * s = r⁻¹) : ∀ (H : Subgroup G), Subgroup.closure ({r} : Set G) ≤ H → (H = Subgroup.closure ({r} : Set G) ∨ H = (⊤ : Subgroup G)) := by sorry`
  Translation: Let G be any group with elements r, s and a natural number n such that r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, and s r s = r^{-1}. Then for every subgroup H of G, if the subgroup generated by r is contained in H, then H equals the subgroup generated by r or H equals the whole group G.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “Show that the subgroup of all rotations in a dihedral group is a maximal subgroup.” This means: In the dihedral group D_{2n} (i.e., the group generated by r and s with relations r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, s r s^{-1} = r^{-1}, and crucially G = ⟨r, s⟩ and order(r) = n), the rotation subgroup ⟨r⟩ is maximal: any subgroup H with ⟨r⟩ ≤ H is either ⟨r⟩ or the whole dihedral group G.

- Code issues:
  1) The code does not assert that G is generated by r and s (i.e., G = ⟨r, s⟩). Without this, the conclusion “H = ⊤” refers to the whole ambient G, which could strictly contain the dihedral subgroup ⟨r, s⟩. In that situation, a subgroup H strictly between ⟨r⟩ and ⟨r, s⟩ would refute the coded conclusion unless G = ⟨r, s⟩ is assumed.
  2) The code only assumes r^n = 1, not that r has order exactly n. In a genuine dihedral group, order(r) = n is essential.
  3) The code uses s r s = r⁻¹ rather than s r s⁻¹ = r⁻¹, but since s^2 = 1, these are equivalent—this is fine.

Step 3: Final check: Are the problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a stronger and generally false generalization: it claims maximality of ⟨r⟩ in any group containing elements r, s satisfying the dihedral relations, without requiring that r, s generate G or that ord(r) = n. The natural language statement is specifically about the dihedral group (i.e., the subgroup generated by r and s with those relations). Therefore, the formalization is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions or placeholders beyond a proof `sorry`. The main issue is missing essential assumptions (G = ⟨r, s⟩ and ord(r) = n), leading to a non-faithful translation. This is a significant conceptual mismatch, hence a low-to-mid score.

  - Conclusion: `IsSolvable H`, i.e., the subgroup H (viewed as a group) is solvable.
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statement exactly captures the natural language claim: ""subgroups of a solvable group are solvable."" It universally quantifies over a group G with the property of being solvable and concludes the property for any subgroup H.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The only constructs used are standard Mathlib notions: `Group`, `Subgroup`, and `IsSolvable`.
- The slight technicality of using `[IsSolvable G]` as a typeclass assumption vs. an explicit hypothesis `hG : IsSolvable G` does not change the mathematical content and is a standard way to pass around such structural properties in Lean.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `A : Type _` with `[Fintype A]` means A is a finite type (finite set). The hypothesis `h_card : Fintype.card A > 1` encodes |A| > 1.
- `G : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm A)` means G is a subgroup of the permutation group on A, i.e., a permutation group acting on A.
- `h_trans : ∀ a b : A, ∃ g : G, (g : Equiv.Perm A) a = b` states that for any a, b in A, there is an element of G sending a to b. This is exactly the definition of transitivity of the action of G on A.
- Conclusion: `∃ σ : G, ∀ a : A, (σ : Equiv.Perm A) a ≠ a` asserts there exists an element σ in G such that for every a in A, σ(a) ≠ a, i.e., σ has no fixed points (a derangement).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let G be a transitive permutation group on a finite set A with |A| > 1. Show there exists σ ∈ G with σ(a) ≠ a for all a ∈ A.
- Lean statement matches point-for-point: finite A with |A|>1, G a subgroup of Sym(A) acting transitively (as given by `h_trans`), and existence of σ ∈ G with no fixed points. No extraneous assumptions and no weakening/strengthening.
- No auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; the only `sorry` is for the proof, which is acceptable under the task instructions.

  This states: For any type G with a group structure, the following are equivalent:
  - For all x, y in G, the inverse of the product equals the product of inverses in the same order, i.e., (x*y)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}.
  - For all x, y in G, multiplication is commutative, i.e., x*y = y*x.

2) Assessment relative to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: “Let G be any group. Prove that the map g ↦ g^{-1} from G to itself is a homomorphism if and only if G is abelian.” A map f is a group homomorphism if f(xy) = f(x) f(y) for all x, y. Taking f(g) = g^{-1}, the homomorphism property reads (xy)^{-1} = x^{-1} y^{-1}. Thus the left-hand side of the Lean equivalence exactly encodes “the inversion map is a homomorphism.” The right-hand side encodes “G is abelian” via ∀ x y, x*y = y*x. Therefore the Lean statement matches the intended iff.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code doesn’t explicitly define the inversion map as a function, but uses the defining homomorphism identity directly, which is equivalent. 
- The abelian property is expressed pointwise as commutativity for all x,y, which matches the standard definition. 
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement is direct and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named Herstein_exercise_4_5_16. It fixes a natural number p with hp : Nat.Prime p, so p is prime. Let n be a natural number. Let q be a polynomial over ZMod p (i.e., F[x] with F = Z_p). Assume hq : Irreducible q and hdeg : q.natDegree = n, i.e., deg(q) = n. It also assumes a typeclass instance [Fintype (Polynomial (ZMod p) ⧸ Ideal.span ({q} : Set (Polynomial (ZMod p))))], meaning the quotient ring is finite (this is a technical assumption to talk about Fintype.card in Lean). The conclusion is a conjunction: (i) IsField (Polynomial (ZMod p) ⧸ Ideal.span {q}), so the quotient ring F[x]/(q) is a field, and (ii) Fintype.card of that quotient equals p ^ n, i.e., the ring has exactly p^n elements.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let F = Z_p with p prime, q(x) ∈ F[x] irreducible of degree n. Show F[x]/(q(x)) is a field with exactly p^n elements.
- Lean: Takes F = ZMod p with p prime, q irreducible in F[x], deg(q) = n, and concludes the quotient by the ideal (q) is a field and has cardinality p^n. The ideal is written as Ideal.span {q}, which matches the notation (q). This matches the mathematical content precisely.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The only extra is the typeclass hypothesis [Fintype …] to use Fintype.card in the conclusion. This is a standard Lean technicality and does not change the mathematical statement; it is implied by (and consistent with) the claim that the cardinality is p^n. No fake or vacuous definitions are used. The rest aligns exactly with the original statement: base field Z_p (p prime), irreducible polynomial of degree n, quotient F[x]/(q), field structure, and cardinality p^n.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- `theorem abelian_simple_group_is_cyclic_prime (G : Type*) [Group G] [CommGroup G] [IsSimpleGroup G] :` Declares a theorem for a type G equipped with a group structure, which is commutative (so G is an abelian group), and is simple (`IsSimpleGroup G`).
- `∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ Nonempty (G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p)) := by sorry` The statement: There exists a natural number p, with p prime, and a group isomorphism between G and `Multiplicative (ZMod p)`. Here, `ZMod p` is the integers modulo p (a ring), and `Multiplicative (ZMod p)` is the same underlying type but with the additive group structure of `ZMod p` viewed as a multiplicative group so that it can be compared to `G` (which is given with multiplicative notation). `Nonempty (G ≃* ...)` means there exists a group isomorphism.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If G is an abelian simple group then G ≅ Z_p for some prime p (do not assume G is finite).""
- Lean: Assumes G is a commutative (abelian) simple group, and concludes the existence of a prime p and an isomorphism of groups `G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p)`. This exactly expresses that G is isomorphic (as a group) to the cyclic group of order p (the additive group of Z/pZ), but written in multiplicative notation via `Multiplicative`. There is no finiteness assumption made.
- The use of `IsSimpleGroup` matches the standard notion (nontrivial, with no nontrivial normal subgroups). For an abelian group, this means no nontrivial subgroups, hence it must be cyclic of prime order, which matches the conclusion.
- The potential ambiguity of ""Z_p"" in natural language is resolved in Lean as `ZMod p`, which is the standard cyclic group of order p under addition; wrapping with `Multiplicative` aligns notations with G's multiplicative group structure.

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are the same. The Lean code does not introduce any extraneous assumptions, nor does it weaken/strengthen the statement improperly. It does not assume finiteness. It uses `ZMod p` to model the cyclic group of order p and matches the intended isomorphism statement.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses the Mathlib library.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_22 (G : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G] : Fintype.card G = 132 → ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G equipped with a group structure and which is finite, if the cardinality of G is 132, then G is not a simple group.
  Here `Fintype.card G = 132` expresses |G| = 132, and `IsSimpleGroup G` is the standard Mathlib predicate for G being simple.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement says: “Prove that if |G| = 132 then G is not simple.” The Lean statement universally quantifies over finite groups G and asserts exactly that if the order of G is 132, then G is not simple. This is precisely the same claim.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The Lean code includes `[Fintype G]`, which is implicit in the phrase “|G| = 132” and thus appropriate.
- `IsSimpleGroup` in Mathlib includes nontriviality, but a group of order 132 is nontrivial, so there is no mismatch.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement appears (with an unfinished proof), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type u} [Group G] [Finite G]`: We work with a finite group G.
- `def is_sylow (p : ℕ) (H : Subgroup G) : Prop := ∃ k, Nat.card (↥H) = p ^ k ∧ p ^ k ∣ Nat.card G ∧ ¬ (p ^ (k + 1) ∣ Nat.card G)`:
  This defines “H is a p-Sylow subgroup of G” to mean: there exists k such that |H| = p^k, p^k divides |G|, and p^(k+1) does not divide |G|. In other words, H has order equal to the highest power of p dividing |G|.
- `def Normal (H : Subgroup G) : Prop := ∀ g x, x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H`:
  H is normal in G if it is closed under conjugation by every g ∈ G. This is the standard normality condition.

  If p is prime, P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G, and P is normal in G, then for any subgroup Q of G, if Q is also a p-Sylow subgroup, we must have Q = P. That is, the p-Sylow subgroup is unique.

2) Faithfulness assessment to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “If P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G and P ◁ G, then P is the only p-Sylow subgroup of G.”
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly this: given P is a p-Sylow subgroup (via the provided predicate) and P is normal, then for every p-Sylow subgroup Q we have Q = P. The requirement that G is finite is implicit in the notion of Sylow subgroups and is made explicit in the code with `[Finite G]`. The code also explicitly assumes p is prime, which is standard in the notion of “p-Sylow”.
- The definition `is_sylow` is slightly nonstandard but equivalent in the finite group setting: a subgroup of order equal to the highest power of p dividing |G| is exactly a Sylow p-subgroup. The extra divisibility conditions on |G| serve to fix k = v_p(|G|). This is faithful to the mathematical meaning.
- The definition of normality via closure under conjugation is standard and faithful.

3) Final comparison:
- The code’s theorem precisely matches the mathematical statement, with the expected finiteness and primality conditions. Auxiliary definitions are legitimate (not vacuous) and correspond to the intended concepts. There are no discrepancies that change the meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- `namespace Subgroup`: Work within the namespace for subgroup-related concepts.

- `def IsCharacteristic (H : Subgroup G) : Prop := ∀ (φ : G ≃* G), Subgroup.map φ.toMonoidHom H = H`:
  This defines “H is characteristic in G” to mean: for every automorphism φ of G (a multiplicative equivalence `G ≃* G`), the image of H under φ (expressed as `Subgroup.map φ.toMonoidHom H`, i.e., φ(H)) equals H. This matches the standard definition: a subgroup fixed by every automorphism.
- `theorem is_characteristic_normal {H : Subgroup G} (h : IsCharacteristic H) : H.Normal := by sorry`:
  This states: if H is characteristic, then H is normal (`H.Normal` is the usual normality predicate). The proof is omitted, but the statement expresses exactly the intended theorem.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is “Prove that characteristic subgroups are normal.”
- The Lean code defines “characteristic subgroup” in the standard way (invariance under all automorphisms) and states the theorem “a characteristic subgroup is normal.”
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; `IsCharacteristic` is a legitimate and faithful definition using Mathlib primitives, and `H.Normal` is the standard normality predicate.
- No extraneous auxiliary definitions are introduced.

  In natural language: For an integer n, if there exist rational numbers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = n (where n is viewed as a rational), then there exist integers x and y such that x^2 + y^2 = n (as an integer equality). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we're auditing the statement.

- The conclusion exactly matches “then it is the sum of two integer squares”: ∃ x y : ℤ, x^2 + y^2 = n.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., positivity) are introduced; none are needed because the implication is conditional on the existence of the rational representation.
- Types and coercions are standard and appropriate: the hypothesis equality is in ℚ using `(n : Rat)`, and the conclusion equality is in ℤ.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions.

Then for every group automorphism f : G ≃* G, the image of H under f (encoded as `Subgroup.map (f.toMonoidHom) H`) equals H. This is precisely saying H is characteristic.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language: The natural statement says: If H is the unique subgroup of a given (finite) order in G, then H is characteristic in G. The Lean statement assumes a natural number n, that H has order n, and that H is the unique subgroup of order n among finite subgroups (which is the only way to speak about order n). The conclusion is invariance under all automorphisms, expressed via `Subgroup.map (f.toMonoidHom) H = H`. This matches the meaning of being characteristic.

The Lean code makes the standard finiteness assumptions needed to talk about `Fintype.card` and expresses characteristic as invariance under all automorphisms.

  - `∀ g x, x ∈ A → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ A`: A is normal in G (closure under conjugation).
  - `∀ x y, x ∈ A → y ∈ A → x * y = y * x`: Any two elements of A commute; A is abelian.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If H is a nontrivial normal subgroup of the solvable group G, then there exists a nontrivial subgroup A of H with A normal in G and A abelian.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes this: it assumes H is nontrivial and normal, and G is solvable, and concludes existence of a nontrivial subgroup A contained in H that is normal in G and abelian.

  - For any type `R` with a ring structure `[Ring R]`, assume `(h)` that every element is idempotent: for all `a : R`, `a * a = a` (which is the same as `a^2 = a`).
  - Conclude: for all `x y : R`, `x * y = y * x`, i.e., multiplication in `R` is commutative.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The hypothesis `∀ a, a * a = a` matches the given definition of Boolean ring (idempotence for all elements). Using `a * a` instead of `a^2` is equivalent in Lean.
- The conclusion `∀ x y, x * y = y * x` exactly states that the ring is commutative with respect to multiplication, which matches “every Boolean ring is commutative.”

  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary type `R` with a ring structure `[Ring R]` and the property `[IsDomain R]` (i.e., `R` is a domain, in Mathlib meaning nontrivial and no zero divisors). For an element `x : R` satisfying `x * x = 1` (i.e., x^2 = 1), the conclusion is `x = 1 ∨ x = -1`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If `R` is an integral domain and `x^2 = 1`, then `x = ± 1`.
- The Lean statement assumes `[Ring R] [IsDomain R]`. In Mathlib, `IsDomain R` expresses that `R` is a (nontrivial) ring without zero divisors; it does not require commutativity, so this is a slight generalization of the usual “integral domain” (commutative) hypothesis, but the conclusion remains valid without commutativity. This generalization is acceptable by the guidelines.
- The hypothesis `h : x * x = 1` faithfully encodes `x^2 = 1`.
- The conclusion `x = 1 ∨ x = -1` is exactly “x = ±1”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_1_22b {G : Type*} [Group G] {S : Set (Subgroup G)} (hne : S.Nonempty) ...` 
  Means: Let G be a group and S a nonempty set of subgroups of G.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ N ∈ S, ∀ g x : G, x ∈ (N : Set G) → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ (N : Set G)` 
  Says: For every subgroup N in S, and every g, x in G, if x ∈ N then g x g⁻¹ ∈ N. This is the elementwise closure-under-conjugation characterization of normality, so it encodes that each N ∈ S is normal in G.
- Conclusion: `∀ (g x : G), x ∈ (Set.sInter (coe '' S)) → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ (Set.sInter (coe '' S))` 
  Says: For all g, x in G, if x belongs to the set-theoretic intersection of the underlying sets of the subgroups in S, then g x g⁻¹ also belongs to this intersection. In other words, the intersection is closed under conjugation by arbitrary elements of G.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the intersection of an arbitrary nonempty collection of normal subgroups of a group is a normal subgroup (no countability assumption).”
- The Lean statement assumes exactly that S is a nonempty collection of subgroups, each normal (via the conjugation-closure formulation), and concludes that the intersection is closed under conjugation. This is the key property needed for normality. However, the Lean theorem does not explicitly assert that the intersection is a subgroup or that it is a normal subgroup as a Subgroup object. It only asserts conjugation-closure of the set-theoretic intersection.
- While it’s standard (and true in Mathlib) that the intersection of subgroups is a subgroup, and combining that with closure under conjugation yields normality, the theorem as stated stops short of the explicit conclusion “the intersection is a normal subgroup.”
- There is no countability assumption anywhere, matching the “do not assume countable” clause.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Close, but not identical. The Lean theorem proves the intersection is closed under conjugation, which together with the known fact that intersections of subgroups are subgroups implies the intersection is a normal subgroup. But the code does not state the final normality conclusion (e.g., as `((sInf S).Normal)` or equivalent), nor does it even package the intersection as a `Subgroup G`. Thus it is slightly weaker than the natural language statement.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are used; the hypotheses are legitimate Mathlib notions, and the statement handles arbitrary (not necessarily countable) families.

Verdict: Very close but not fully faithful because the final conclusion “is a normal subgroup” is not explicitly stated; only the key conjugation-closure is proved.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement: Let A be an abelian group and B a subgroup of A. Prove that A/B is abelian.
- The code sets A to be an AddCommGroup (abelian group), B to be an AddSubgroup (subgroup in additive form), defines the quotient by the standard relation x ~ y iff x − y ∈ B, and states a theorem that the quotient has an AddCommGroup structure. This is conceptually faithful to the statement.

3) Final check and discrepancies
- The main issue is the use of `sorry` in the definition of the setoid (the proof that the relation is an equivalence) and again in the theorem asserting the AddCommGroup structure. Per the guidelines, auxiliary definitions and the final theorem cannot rely on `sorry`/placeholders; they must be legitimate. The presence of `sorry` in the setoid definition makes that auxiliary definition incomplete/vacuous in the required sense.
- Additionally, while the statement of the theorem matches the intended mathematical content, the code does not provide the actual operations nor the instance—only asserts existence via `sorry`.
- These issues mean the translation fails the audit despite being conceptually on target. If the sorries were replaced by bona fide proofs (or by using Mathlib’s existing structures for quotient groups of additive groups), the translation would be faithful.

Conclusion: Conceptually correct, but fails due to vacuous placeholders (`sorry`) in critical parts of the definition and theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {R : Type*} {G : Type*} [Semiring R] [Group G] [Fintype G]`: We work with a semiring R and a finite group G (finite ensured by `[Fintype G]`). In Mathlib, the group ring RG is represented by `MonoidAlgebra R G`.
- `noncomputable def N : MonoidAlgebra R G := ∑ g : G, MonoidAlgebra.of R G g`: Define N to be the sum, in the monoid algebra (group ring), of all basis elements corresponding to elements of G. That is exactly N = g1 + ... + gn, where the coefficient of each group element is 1_R.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_2_12 : ∀ a : MonoidAlgebra R G, N * a = a * N := by sorry`: States that for every element a of the group ring, N commutes with a, i.e., N*a = a*N.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: For a finite group G, the element N = sum of all group elements is in the center of the group ring RG. Being in the center is equivalent to commuting with every element of the ring. The Lean theorem precisely asserts ∀ a, N*a = a*N in `MonoidAlgebra R G`, which is the Mathlib model of RG. The definition of N matches the intended element.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean code uses `MonoidAlgebra R G` with `[Semiring R]` rather than requiring R to be a ring. This is a slight generalization (it works over any semiring, not just a ring) and does not change the mathematical content of the centrality claim.
- The natural language specifies G as finite explicitly; the Lean code encodes this via `[Fintype G]`.
- The code expresses centrality via the commuting equation ∀ a, N*a = a*N rather than explicitly referencing the center. These are equivalent.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; `N` is a genuine definition, and the theorem states the intended property (the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation (indeed a slight but acceptable generalization) of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `lemma rat_no_finite_index_subgroup (H : AddSubgroup Rat) (h : AddSubgroup.index H ≠ 0) : H = (⊤ : AddSubgroup Rat) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let H be an additive subgroup of the rationals Q. If the index of H in Q is nonzero, then H equals the whole group (i.e., H = Q).
  In Mathlib, `AddSubgroup.index H : ℕ` is defined so that it is the finite cardinality of the quotient when the index is finite, and is 0 otherwise (i.e., when the index is infinite). Hence the hypothesis `AddSubgroup.index H ≠ 0` formalizes “H has finite index in Q.”

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that Q has no proper subgroups of finite index.”
- The Lean statement says: For any additive subgroup H of Q, if H has finite index (captured by `index H ≠ 0`), then H = ⊤. This is equivalent to saying there is no proper subgroup of finite index. The use of `AddSubgroup` matches the standard interpretation of Q as an additive group.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The conclusion `H = ⊤` under the finite index hypothesis is exactly the formal counterpart of “no proper finite-index subgroup.”
- There is no mismatch in generality or meaning. Using the additive structure is the conventional reading of the statement.

Therefore, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_2b : Irreducible (X ^ 6 + 30 * X ^ 5 - 15 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X - 120 : Polynomial ℤ) := by sorry` states the theorem that the polynomial over the integers `X^6 + 30 X^5 - 15 X^3 + 6 X - 120` is irreducible in `Polynomial ℤ` (i.e., in ℤ[x]). The `by sorry` means the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove that `x^6 + 30x^5 - 15x^3 + 6x - 120` is irreducible in ℤ[x]. The Lean statement asserts exactly `Irreducible (X ^ 6 + 30 * X ^ 5 - 15 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X - 120 : Polynomial ℤ)`. This precisely matches the intended polynomial and the ring ℤ[x].

3) Final check:
- Same polynomial: yes (matching coefficients and exponents).
- Same ring/context: yes (Polynomial ℤ = ℤ[x]).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions: none present.
Thus the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MvPolynomial`: setup, bringing Mathlib and the multivariable polynomial namespace into scope.
- The theorem statement introduces the ring `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ`, which is the polynomial ring in two indeterminates over ℚ, i.e., ℚ[x,y] (with variables indexed by `0` and `1`).
- `MvPolynomial.X (0 : Fin 2)` and `MvPolynomial.X (1 : Fin 2)` denote the two coordinate indeterminates, corresponding to `x` and `y`.
- `Ideal.span ({MvPolynomial.X (0 : Fin 2), MvPolynomial.X (1 : Fin 2)} : Set (MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ))` is the ideal generated by `x` and `y`, i.e., `(x, y)`.
- `¬ ∃ f : MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ, ... = Ideal.span ({f} : Set (MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ))` asserts that there does not exist a single polynomial `f` whose principal ideal equals the ideal generated by `x` and `y`. In other words, `(x, y)` is not principal.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The natural language statement is: Prove that `(x, y)` is not a principal ideal in `ℚ[x, y]`.
- The Lean statement: In `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` (canonically ℚ[x, y]), the ideal generated by the two variables `X 0` and `X 1` is not of the form `Ideal.span {f}` for any `f`. This is precisely the same as saying `(x, y)` is not principal.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The only difference is formalization via `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` instead of explicitly writing `ℚ[x, y]`, and naming the variables as `X 0`, `X 1` instead of `x`, `y`. These are standard and faithful formalizations; no change in mathematical content.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement directly captures the claim. The `sorry` only omits the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formal statement of the natural language proposition.

  • G is a type with a group structure, finite (Fintype G), and decidable equality (to talk about Finsets). Hypothesis `h` asserts |G| > 2.
  • Conclusion: `¬ ∃ (H : Finset G), ...` says there does not exist a finite subset H of G with the following properties:
    - `H.card = Fintype.card G - 1`: the number of elements of H is n−1.
    - `(1 : G) ∈ H`: H contains the identity element.
    - `(∀ a b, a ∈ H → b ∈ H → a * b ∈ H)`: H is closed under multiplication.
    - `(∀ a, a ∈ H → a⁻¹ ∈ H)`: H is closed under taking inverses.
  These are exactly the subgroup axioms (for a subset of a group) expressed in terms of membership in a finite set of elements.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asserts: In a finite group G with |G| = n > 2, there is no subgroup H with |H| = n − 1.
- The Lean statement asserts: Under the same finiteness (and decidable equality) and |G| > 2, there is no Finset H of G with cardinal n − 1 that contains 1 and is closed under multiplication and inverse.
- In a finite group, describing a subgroup as a subset closed under multiplication and inverses and containing 1 is standard and equivalent. Using `Finset G` is a natural representation of such a finite subset in Lean; with `[DecidableEq G]` every finite subset can be represented as a Finset, and conversely any such Finset defines a subgroup (as a set) with those closure properties.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the original claim.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only technical difference is representing a subgroup as a Finset satisfying closure properties rather than using Mathlib's `Subgroup G`. Given the finite context and included closure axioms and 1 ∈ H, this is mathematically equivalent for the purpose of the theorem. The added `[DecidableEq G]` is a technical requirement for Finset and does not alter the mathematical content.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib structures. The `sorry` is in the proof, which is allowed per the task.
- Conclusion: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code to natural language.
- `variable {G : Type u} [Group G]`: Fix a (not necessarily finite) group G.
- `def left_coset_set (g : G) (H : Subgroup G) : Set G := (fun x => g * x) '' (H : Set G)`: For a subgroup H ≤ G and an element g ∈ G, define the left coset gH as the set { g*h | h ∈ H } ⊆ G.
- `def left_cosets (H : Subgroup G) : Type u := { s : Set G // ∃ g : G, s = left_coset_set g H }`: Define the type of left cosets of H in G as the subtype of subsets of G which are equal to gH for some g ∈ G. This type represents the collection of left cosets of H in G.
- `def left_cosets_in_K (H K : Subgroup G) : Type u := { s : Set G // ∃ k : K, s = left_coset_set (k : G) H }`: Define the type of left cosets of H with representatives in K: i.e., sets of the form kH with k ∈ K. When H ≤ K, these are exactly the left cosets of H in K (considered as subsets of G).
- The theorem statement: `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_2_11 {H K : Subgroup G} (hHK : H ≤ K) : Cardinal.mk (left_cosets H) = Cardinal.mk (left_cosets K) * Cardinal.mk (left_cosets_in_K H K)`. This asserts that the cardinality of the set of left cosets of H in G equals the product of the cardinality of the set of left cosets of K in G and the cardinality of the set of left cosets of H in K, assuming H ≤ K.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The natural language statement is: For subgroups H ≤ K ≤ G, |G:H| = |G:K| * |K:H|, without assuming finiteness. In Lean, `Cardinal.mk (left_cosets H)` is |G:H|, `Cardinal.mk (left_cosets K)` is |G:K|, and `Cardinal.mk (left_cosets_in_K H K)` is |K:H|. The hypothesis `hHK : H ≤ K` matches H ≤ K; K ≤ G is inherent since K is a `Subgroup G`. No finiteness is assumed. Thus the theorem statement matches exactly the intended identity of indices as cardinals.
- The auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no placeholders or vacuous definitions) and accurately model cosets and their collections. Representing cosets of H in K as subsets of G via `left_cosets_in_K` is standard and equivalent in cardinality to the usual notion of cosets in K, especially under the hypothesis H ≤ K, since kH ⊆ K.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Left vs right cosets: consistently left, which matches the standard notation |G:H|.
- The interpretation of |K:H| uses cosets viewed as subsets of G rather than subsets of K; under H ≤ K these sets lie in K, and the collection is the same up to canonical identification, so the cardinality agrees.
- No hidden assumptions (e.g., finiteness). The scope matches H ≤ K ≤ G.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully states the natural language theorem with correct and non-vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Step-by-step translation of Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: Bring in mathlib and polynomial namespace.
- The theorem `dummit_foote_exercise_9_3_2` is stated for `f g : Polynomial ℚ`, i.e., polynomials with rational coefficients.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ z : Int, (f * g).coeff n = (z : ℚ)` means: for every natural number n, the nth coefficient of the product polynomial f*g is an integer (viewed in ℚ). This formalizes “the product f(x)g(x) has integer coefficients.”
- Conclusion `∀ i j : ℕ, ∃ z : Int, f.coeff i * g.coeff j = (z : ℚ)` means: for any indices i, j, the product of the ith coefficient of f and the jth coefficient of g is an integer (viewed in ℚ). This formalizes “the product of any coefficient of g(x) with any coefficient of f(x) is an integer.”

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The domain (polynomials over ℚ) matches the natural language.
- “Product has integer coefficients” is captured by each coefficient of f*g equaling some integer embedded into ℚ.
- The goal precisely states that for any two coefficients (one from f and one from g), their product is an integer (again, as an element of ℚ coming from ℤ). Commutativity makes the order of f and g coefficients irrelevant.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is directly the statement to be proved.

Final check:
- The formal statement and the natural language statement coincide in mathematical meaning. There are no extraneous assumptions or weakenings/strengthenings. Handling of zero coefficients is consistent (0 is an integer). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `def comm_set (H : Subgroup G) : Set G := { x : G | ∃ (g h : G), h ∈ H ∧ x = g * h * g⁻¹ * h⁻¹ }`:
  Defines the set of commutators [g, h] = g h g⁻¹ h⁻¹ where g ranges over G and h ranges over H. This matches the usual notion of commutators [G,H].

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_5_4_2 (H : Subgroup G) : (∀ g h : G, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H) ↔ Subgroup.closure (comm_set H) ≤ H := by sorry`:
  States that: for a subgroup H of G, the following are equivalent:
  • For all g in G and h in G, if h ∈ H then g h g⁻¹ ∈ H. This is exactly the standard formulation that H is normal in G (closure under conjugation by arbitrary g).
  • The subgroup generated by the commutators [g,h] with g ∈ G and h ∈ H (i.e., `Subgroup.closure (comm_set H)`, which is [G,H]) is contained in H.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that a subgroup H of G is normal if and only if [G,H] ≤ H.”
- The Lean statement’s left side expresses normality of H via conjugation stability: ∀ g, ∀ h ∈ H, g h g⁻¹ ∈ H.
- The right side is exactly “[G,H] ≤ H”, realized as `Subgroup.closure (comm_set H) ≤ H`, with `comm_set H` the set of commutators [g,h] for g ∈ G, h ∈ H.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; `comm_set` is a legitimate definition, and the theorem statement exactly matches the mathematical claim. Using an explicit quantifier formulation of normality instead of `H.Normal` is a standard equivalent formulation.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same: the code precisely formalizes the statement “H is normal iff [G,H] ≤ H.” No extraneous assumptions or weakenings are introduced, and the definition of [G,H] matches the intended one.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_14 {G : Type u} [Group G] [Finite G] (h : Nat.card G = 312) :` sets up a finite group G with order 312.
- `∃ P : Subgroup G,` asserts the existence of a subgroup P of G.
- `Nat.card (↑P) = 13` states that P has order 13.
- `∧ (∀ g k : G, k ∈ P → g * k * g⁻¹ ∈ P)` states that P is closed under conjugation by all elements of G, i.e., P is a normal subgroup of G.

Thus the theorem claims: If |G| = 312, then there exists a normal subgroup P of G with order 13.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Prove that a group of order 312 has a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order.”
- The code asserts a stronger, more specific claim: existence of a normal subgroup of order 13. Since 312 = 2^3 * 3 * 13, a subgroup of order 13 is indeed a Sylow 13-subgroup (13 is the maximal power of 13 dividing 312). Being normal as stated implies it is a normal Sylow p-subgroup with p = 13.

Checks for potential red flags:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given.
- Normality is correctly captured by closure under conjugation.
- While the code does not explicitly use Mathlib’s Sylow language, the order condition (13) inherently gives the Sylow property in this specific group order, so the mathematical content matches (indeed strengthens) the original statement.

Final check:
- The code’s statement implies the natural statement (choosing p = 13). It is a legitimate, faithful, and even stronger formulation. No discrepancies that would invalidate the translation.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: We are working with a finite group G.
- `variable (has_subgroup_of_order : ℕ → Prop)`: Introduces an abstract predicate on natural numbers, intended (per the comment) to mean “G has a subgroup of order k,” but Lean does not enforce this meaning; it's an uninterpreted predicate.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_2_14 (h_card_composite : ∃ d : ℕ, 1 < d ∧ d < Fintype.card G ∧ d ∣ Fintype.card G) ...`: Assumes |G| is composite via existence of a proper divisor d with 1 < d < |G| and d divides |G|. This matches “G has composite order n.”
- `(h_subgroups : ∀ k : ℕ, k ∣ Fintype.card G → has_subgroup_of_order k)`: Assumes that for each k dividing |G|, the abstract predicate `has_subgroup_of_order k` holds. This is intended to encode “G has a subgroup of order k for every divisor k of |G|,” but since `has_subgroup_of_order` is uninterpreted, this is not actually tied to subgroups in Mathlib.
- `: ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`: Concludes that G is not simple (using Mathlib's notion `IsSimpleGroup`). Proof omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let G be a finite group of composite order n with the property that G has a subgroup of order k for each positive integer k dividing n. Prove that G is not simple.
- The code captures: finite group, composite order, and a property for all divisors k of |G|. It does not explicitly say “positive,” but in ℕ, k ∣ |G| excludes k = 0 (since |G| > 0 for a finite group), so positivity is effectively enforced.
- The major discrepancy: the predicate `has_subgroup_of_order` is merely a variable predicate and not defined via Mathlib’s `Subgroup G` and `Fintype.card`. Thus the assumption does not actually state the subgroup property; it could be any predicate, making the hypothesis vacuous relative to subgroups.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
- The critical auxiliary “definition” is vacuous/uninterpreted. According to the guidelines, this is a red flag: the code avoids the actual subgroup structure and uses an abstract predicate. If this were replaced by a faithful definition, e.g. `has_subgroup_of_order k := ∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = k`, the theorem statement would match the natural language well. As written, it is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MvPolynomial`: Bring in Mathlib and open the multivariable polynomial namespace.
- Comment explains the modeling: Q[x,y] is represented as `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ`, with `X 0` as x and `X 1` as y.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_11 : Irreducible (X (0 : Fin 2) ^ 2 + X (1 : Fin 2) ^ 2 - C (1 : ℚ)) := by sorry`.
  This asserts that the element `X 0 ^ 2 + X 1 ^ 2 - C 1` in `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` is irreducible. Here, `X (0 : Fin 2)` and `X (1 : Fin 2)` are the two indeterminates (x and y), `^ 2` squares them, `C (1 : ℚ)` is the constant polynomial 1, and `Irreducible` is the standard Mathlib notion of irreducibility for elements in a commutative semiring.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement is: prove that x^2 + y^2 − 1 is irreducible in Q[x,y]. The Lean statement asserts exactly that, interpreted in the standard Mathlib model of Q[x,y] as `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ`, with the same polynomial `x^2 + y^2 − 1` and the same property `Irreducible`. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Natural language uses Q[x,y]; Lean uses `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ`, which is a standard formalization of the polynomial ring in two variables over Q. Equivalent.
- Polynomial: `x^2 + y^2 - 1` matches `X 0 ^ 2 + X 1 ^ 2 - C 1` exactly.
- Property: irreducible matches `Irreducible` in Mathlib. No extra hypotheses or changes.
There are no discrepancies. The presence of `sorry` affects proof, not the faithfulness of the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_18 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 200) :` sets up a finite group G with |G| = 200.
- `∃ P : Sylow 5 G, ...` asserts the existence of a Sylow 5-subgroup P of G.
- `∀ g x, x ∈ (P : Subgroup G) → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ (P : Subgroup G)` states that for every g in G and every x in P, the conjugate g x g⁻¹ is also in P. This is exactly the elementwise characterization of P being normal in G.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The code asserts: For a finite group G with order 200, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P that is normal. This matches the natural language statement ""a group of order 200 has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup.""

- Same context (finite group of order 200).

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- The docstring claims the exercise is about Z[i]/(1+i) being a field of order 2 and says they will state an equivalent concrete conclusion that the quotient is isomorphic to ZMod 2, hence ZMod 2 is a field with 2 elements.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_8_3_6a : IsField (ZMod 2) ∧ Fintype.card (ZMod 2) = 2 := by sorry` states: “ZMod 2 is a field and has exactly 2 elements.” The proof is omitted.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that the quotient ring Z[i]/(1+i) is a field of order 2.” A faithful formalization would need to talk about the quotient of the Gaussian integers by the ideal generated by (1+i), and then show it is a field with two elements (or isomorphic to ZMod 2).
- The provided Lean theorem does not mention Z[i], the ideal (1+i), the quotient ring, or any isomorphism. It only asserts that ZMod 2 is a field of cardinality 2, which is true but unrelated to the specific quotient under discussion.
- The docstring’s claim that they are stating the “equivalent concrete conclusion” is not reflected in the theorem statement; there is no equivalence or isomorphism stated between Z[i]/(1+i) and ZMod 2.

Final check:
- The two problems are different. The Lean code proves a general fact about ZMod 2, not the specific property of the quotient ring Z[i]/(1+i).
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the issue is that the main statement is not the same as the original.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `theorem dummit_foote_ex_8_1_12 {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 < n) {M M1 : Int} {d d' : ℕ}`: We fix a natural number n with 1 < n (so n > 1), integers M and M1, and natural numbers d and d'.
- `(hM : Int.gcd M (n : Int) = 1)`: M is relatively prime to n (viewed as an integer).
- `(hd : Nat.Coprime d (Nat.totient n))`: d is relatively prime to φ(n), Euler’s totient function of n.
- `(hcong : Int.ModEq (n : Int) M1 (M ^ d))`: M1 ≡ M^d (mod n).
- `(hinv : Nat.ModEq (Nat.totient n) (d * d') 1)`: d * d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)); i.e., d' is an inverse of d modulo φ(n).
- Conclusion: `Int.ModEq (n : Int) M (M1 ^ d')`: M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod n).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language statement: Let N be a positive integer. Let M be an integer coprime to N and d an integer coprime to φ(N). If M1 ≡ M^d (mod N), then M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod N) where d' is the inverse of d modulo φ(N), i.e., d d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(N)).

The Lean theorem matches this exactly:
- N corresponds to n, M and M1 are integers, d and d' are natural numbers (a harmless restriction, since modular arithmetic only depends on residue classes).
- Coprimality conditions match: gcd(M, n) = 1 and Coprime(d, φ(n)).
- The hypothesis M1 ≡ M^d (mod n) is present.
- The condition d d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)) is present.
- The conclusion M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod n) is exactly the desired result.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The only notable difference is the extra technical assumption `1 < n` rather than merely “n is positive.” This is a slight strengthening and standard in number-theoretic formalizations; it does not change the essence of the statement and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- Using ℕ for d, d' instead of ℤ is a benign specialization (modular statements are insensitive to sign representatives).
- All auxiliary notions (ModEq, totient, gcd) are standard Mathlib definitions; no vacuous placeholders are used.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only a harmless strengthening (n > 1).

  • Parameters and typeclass assumptions: G is a finite group; p is prime.
  • `P : Sylow p G`: P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
  • `H : Subgroup G`: H is a subgroup of G.
  • `h : P.toSubgroup ≤ H`: The subgroup underlying P is contained in H (i.e., H contains P).
  • Conclusion: Produce a term of type `Sylow p (↥H)`, i.e., a Sylow p-subgroup of the group H.
  • The body is `sorry`, meaning the proof/construction is omitted, but the statement (type) is what matters for translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
The natural language statement says: If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and H is a subgroup containing P, then P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. In Lean, `Sylow p (↥H)` denotes a Sylow p-subgroup of the subgroup H (viewed as its own group). The hypothesis `h : P.toSubgroup ≤ H` expresses that H contains P. Thus, the declaration’s type asserts the existence (indeed, constructs) a Sylow p-subgroup of H associated to P. This is the correct formalization of “P ∈ Syl_p(H)” in the typed setting, where we must move from a Sylow in G to a Sylow in H.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Assumptions match: G finite, p prime, P a Sylow p-subgroup of G, H a subgroup containing P.
- Conclusion matches: there is a Sylow p-subgroup of H corresponding to P. While the type does not explicitly assert equality of the resulting Sylow’s underlying subgroup with P’s underlying subgroup restricted to H, the function is clearly intended to produce exactly that object, and in Lean’s setting returning a `Sylow p (↥H)` from P and the inclusion is the faithful rendition of “P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H.”
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only `sorry` is the proof term, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language claim.

- `: CommGroup G := by sorry`: Conclude/provide a commutative group structure on G.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The hypotheses: For a group of order 105, a subgroup P of order 3 that is normal is exactly a Sylow 3-subgroup and normal, since the highest power of 3 dividing 105 is 3. So the premises effectively match the natural language statement.
- The conclusion mismatch: The Lean code returns `CommGroup G`, i.e., it constructs a commutative group structure on the type G. This does not assert that the given group structure `[Group G]` is abelian (commutative). In Lean, `CommGroup G` is a structure, not a proposition about the existing multiplication. Without explicitly tying the `CommGroup` structure to the given `[Group G]` operations, this could be a different (unrelated) commutative group structure on the same underlying type. The intended mathematical statement is that the existing group operation on G is commutative. A faithful Lean conclusion would be a proposition like `IsCommutative G (· * ·)` or `IsAbelian G` (if available), or to provide a `CommGroup` instance extending the existing `Group` structure (which the type alone does not enforce).
- Other details: Using the elementwise normality condition is fine. Introducing `[Fintype P]` is redundant but harmless. The use of `def` with `sorry` is acceptable for a translation audit, as we ignore proofs.

Final comparison: The premises are essentially faithful. The conclusion, however, is not: proving `CommGroup G` as a bare structure is not the same as proving that the given group structure on G is abelian. Thus the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- The code defines df_polynomial to be the explicit expansion of ((X+2)^p − 2^p)/X and then asserts it is irreducible for p prime and p ≠ 2. This matches exactly: same ring ℤ[x], same polynomial (via standard binomial expansion), same hypothesis (“odd prime” encoded as prime and not equal to 2), and same conclusion (irreducible).

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Minor presentational difference: the code works with the expanded form rather than the quotient notation; but the expansion is mathematically identical to ((X+2)^p − 2^p)/X.
- “Odd prime” is expressed as Nat.Prime p plus p ≠ 2, which is equivalent for primes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `/-- Exercise: Show that the class of p in Z/p^m Z is nilpotent. -/`: A comment describing the goal.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_3_37 (p m : ℕ) (hm : 1 ≤ m) : IsNilpotent (p : ZMod (p ^ m)) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: for natural numbers p and m with m ≥ 1, the element p in the ring ZMod (p^m) (i.e., ℤ/ p^m ℤ) is nilpotent. `IsNilpotent (p : ZMod (p ^ m))` is the standard Mathlib predicate asserting that the element p is nilpotent, i.e., ∃ n, p^n = 0 in ℤ/p^mℤ.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language says: the ideal p ℤ / p^m ℤ is a nilpotent ideal in the ring ℤ / p^m ℤ.
- In a commutative ring, for a principal ideal (a), the ideal is nilpotent iff the element a is nilpotent, because (a)^n = (a^n) and (a^n) = (0) iff a^n = 0. Hence, showing that the class of p is nilpotent as an element is equivalent to showing that the ideal generated by p is a nilpotent ideal.
- Therefore, the theorem statement `IsNilpotent (p : ZMod (p ^ m))` is a faithful formalization of the intended claim about the ideal.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean theorem assumes `1 ≤ m`. The natural language did not explicitly state this, but ℤ/p^mℤ is typically considered for m ≥ 1, and the claim remains true even for m = 0 (the ring is trivial and p maps to 0, which is nilpotent). This mild restriction is acceptable and does not change the essence of the statement.
- The Lean code asserts nilpotency of the element rather than directly of the ideal. As explained, these are equivalent in this commutative ring context, so the translation is faithful.
- There are no auxiliary, vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is allowed for this auditing task.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context declares G is a finite group: `{G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]`.
- It introduces natural numbers p, q, r with proofs they are primes: `(hp : Nat.Prime p) (hq : Nat.Prime q) (hr : Nat.Prime r)` and strict inequalities `(hlt1 : p < q) (hlt2 : q < r)`, ensuring p, q, r are distinct primes with p < q < r.
- It assumes the order of G is p*q*r: `(hcard : Fintype.card G = p * q * r)`.
- The conclusion asserts the existence of a subgroup H of G, together with an explicit finiteness structure `hH : Fintype H` (this is redundant since subgroups of a finite group are automatically finite, but harmless). It then states two properties:
  1) `Fintype.card H = p ∨ Fintype.card H = q ∨ Fintype.card H = r`, i.e., the order of H is one of the three primes.
  2) `∀ x g : G, g ∈ H → x * g * x⁻¹ ∈ H`, i.e., H is closed under conjugation by arbitrary elements x of G. This is equivalent to normality of H.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For a finite group G of order pqr with p < q < r primes, G has a normal Sylow subgroup for one of p, q, or r.
- In a group of order pqr with distinct primes p, q, r, a Sylow p-subgroup has order p, similarly for q and r. Thus, a subgroup of order p (respectively q or r) is automatically a Sylow p-subgroup (respectively q- or r-Sylow), since the highest power of p dividing |G| is p^1. Therefore, the Lean code's requirement that H has order p, q, or r ensures H is a Sylow subgroup for the corresponding prime.
- The normality condition is correctly expressed by closure under conjugation (one inclusion direction is sufficient, as it implies equality by symmetry using x and x⁻¹).
- The extra existential `hH : Fintype H` is redundant but legitimate and does not change the mathematical content.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim: it asserts existence of a normal subgroup H that is necessarily a Sylow subgroup for one of p, q, r because its order equals one of those primes. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions are standard from Mathlib.
- Minor redundancy aside, there is no mismatch.
