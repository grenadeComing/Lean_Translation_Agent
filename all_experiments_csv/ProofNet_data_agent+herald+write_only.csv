",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib, which provides the `Irrational` predicate and standard real/rational structures.
- `/-- ... -/`: A docstring stating the natural language claim: If r is rational (r ≠ 0) and x is irrational, then r * x is irrational.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_1b (r : ℚ) (x : ℝ) (hr : r ≠ 0) (hx : Irrational x) : Irrational ((r : ℝ) * x) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: given r is a rational number (type `ℚ`), x is a real number (type `ℝ`), with assumptions `hr : r ≠ 0` and `hx : Irrational x`, the conclusion is `Irrational ((r : ℝ) * x)`. The notation `(r : ℝ)` coerces the rational r into a real number before multiplication, so the statement is: the product of a nonzero rational and an irrational real is irrational. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this does not affect the statement's faithfulness.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean statement precisely matches the natural language: it assumes r is rational and nonzero, x is irrational, and concludes r*x is irrational. The setting is in real numbers, which is standard when discussing irrational numbers. The coercion from `ℚ` to `ℝ` is appropriate and faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Natural language: ""If r is rational (r ≠ 0) and x is irrational, prove that rx is irrational.""
- Lean: Assumes r : ℚ (hence rational), hr : r ≠ 0, x : ℝ with hx : Irrational x, concludes Irrational ((r : ℝ) * x).
There are no extraneous or missing conditions. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The only technical detail is explicit typing and coercion, which aligns with the intended meaning. Therefore, the two statements are the same.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, providing the standard library of mathematics for Lean, including topology and metric spaces.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem compact_metric_space_second_countable {α : Type*} [MetricSpace α] [CompactSpace α] : SecondCountableTopology α := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type α equipped with a metric (so α is a metric space) and whose induced topology is compact (CompactSpace α), the topology on α is second countable (i.e., has a countable base). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the instructions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that every compact metric space K has a countable base.""
- The Lean statement precisely asserts: every compact metric space α is second countable. In Mathlib, `SecondCountableTopology α` is exactly the property of having a countable base. Hence the statement directly matches the natural language proposition.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No extra hypotheses or constraints are added.
- No change in generality: it is exactly about compact metric spaces, asserting second countability.
- Terminology: ""countable base"" equals ""second countable""; this is standard and intended.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Filter` and `open Topology` open namespaces for filter and topology notions, used for limits.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_2a : Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => Real.sqrt ((n : ℝ) ^ 2 + (n : ℝ)) - (n : ℝ)) atTop (nhds (1 / 2 : ℝ)) := by sorry`
  This states: the function from natural numbers n to real numbers given by n ↦ sqrt(n^2 + n) − n (with n coerced to ℝ) tends to 1/2 as n goes to infinity, where the notion of ""goes to infinity"" is the filter `atTop` on ℕ, and the target limit is the neighborhood filter `nhds (1/2)` on ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement is: Prove that lim_{n→∞} sqrt(n^2 + n) − n = 1/2. The Lean statement asserts exactly that the sequence indexed by ℕ, n ↦ sqrt(n^2 + n) − n, has limit 1/2 as n → ∞ (via `atTop`). The coercions `(n : ℝ)` ensure the expression is in ℝ, matching the usual real limit. This is the standard formalization of the given limit statement.

3) Final check:
- Variables and context: n ranges over ℕ (a standard choice for sequences). The original statement uses n→∞, which typically implies n is an integer index; using ℕ is appropriate.
- Expression matches: `Real.sqrt ((n : ℝ) ^ 2 + (n : ℝ)) - (n : ℝ)` is exactly √(n^2 + n) − n after casting to ℝ.
- Limit claim: `Tendsto ... atTop (nhds (1/2))` is the formal version of the limit equaling 1/2.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This declares a theorem: For any complex number z with norm ‖z‖ = 1, the quantity ‖1 + z‖^2 + ‖1 − z‖^2 equals 4. No auxiliary definitions; `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Hypothesis: The natural language says |z| = 1 (equivalently z z̄ = 1). The Lean hypothesis `hz : ‖z‖ = 1` matches this.
- Conclusion: Compute |1+z|^2 + |1−z|^2. The theorem asserts it equals 4, which is the standard result. The expressions in Lean use the norm `‖·‖` on ℂ (a real value) and the square via natural power `^2`, which correctly represents |·|^2.

3) Final check:
- The Lean statement is the same problem as the natural language one: same domain (complex numbers), same hypothesis (|z| = 1), same computed quantity, and same result (4). No extraneous assumptions or generalizations. No vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's libraries.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_3_7` is stated for a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` of real numbers.
- Hypotheses:
  - `h_nonneg : ∀ n, 0 ≤ a n`: every term `a_n` is nonnegative.
  - `h_sum : Summable a`: the series Σ a_n converges.
- Conclusion: `Summable fun n => Real.sqrt (a n) / ((n + 1 : ℕ) : ℝ)`: the series Σ sqrt(a_n)/(n+1) (with n starting at 0) converges.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but per the task we only assess the statement/translation fidelity.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: If Σ a_n converges with a_n ≥ 0, then Σ sqrt(a_n)/n converges.
- The Lean statement imposes the same nonnegativity and convergence assumptions and concludes the convergence of Σ sqrt(a_n)/(n+1) with n starting from 0. This is the standard index shift to avoid division by zero at n=0; it is equivalent to summing sqrt(a_n)/n from n=1 to ∞ in natural language.
- Domain is ℝ with nonnegativity, matching the typical reading of the original statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct and faithful.

Final check for differences:
- Only a harmless indexing/denominator adjustment: Lean uses (n+1) in the denominator with n starting at 0, which matches the natural language intention of using n in the denominator starting at n=1. This is a standard and faithful formalization detail.
- Otherwise, the hypotheses and the conclusion match exactly.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib; no mathematical content.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_4 {α : Type _} [Preorder α] {E : Set α} (hne : ∃ x, x ∈ E) {a b : α} (ha : ∀ x ∈ E, a ≤ x) (hb : ∀ x ∈ E, x ≤ b) : a ≤ b := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for any type α equipped with a Preorder (i.e., a relation ≤ that is reflexive and transitive). Let E be a subset of α, assumed nonempty (`∃ x, x ∈ E`). Let a and b be elements of α such that for all x in E, `a ≤ x` (i.e., a is a lower bound of E) and for all x in E, `x ≤ b` (i.e., b is an upper bound of E). The conclusion is `a ≤ b`.

2) Assessment of correctness:
- The natural language statement: For a nonempty subset E of an ordered set, if α is a lower bound of E and β is an upper bound of E, then α ≤ β.
- The Lean code mirrors this: E nonempty, a lower bound (∀ x ∈ E, a ≤ x) and b upper bound (∀ x ∈ E, x ≤ b), conclude a ≤ b. The structure `[Preorder α]` is a mild generalization of ""ordered set"" (it requires only reflexivity and transitivity of ≤), which is sufficient for the conclusion. No extra or missing assumptions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the placeholders are only a proof `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation checking.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Scope: The Lean theorem is slightly more general (Preorder vs possibly a stricter notion of ordered set), but this does not weaken the statement; it still faithfully represents the intended claim.
- All components (nonemptiness of E, definitions of lower and upper bounds, and the desired conclusion) align.
- No hidden or missing conditions. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib` loads mathlib. The subsequent `open` statements are unused but harmless.
- The docstring states the goal: for complex numbers z₁,…,zₙ, show |z₁+…+zₙ| ≤ |z₁|+…+|zₙ|.
- `theorem abs_sum_le_sum_abs (n : ℕ) (z : Fin n → ℂ) : Complex.abs (∑ i, z i) ≤ ∑ i, Complex.abs (z i)` states: for any natural number n and any function z from `Fin n` (i.e., indices 0,…,n−1) to ℂ, the modulus of the finite sum of the z i is at most the sum of their moduli. Here `∑ i, ...` denotes the finite sum over all i in `Fin n`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
This is exactly the triangle inequality for a finite sum of n complex numbers. Using `Fin n → ℂ` faithfully represents a list of n complex numbers (z₀,…,z_{n-1}), which corresponds to z₁,…,zₙ up to indexing convention. The sums of values and their absolute values are exactly those in the natural language statement.

3) Final check:
The mathematical content matches: it asserts |Σ z_i| ≤ Σ |z_i| for n terms. The Lean statement even allows n = 0 (empty sum), which is a harmless slight generalization consistent with the intended statement. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The presence of `sorry` affects proof, not the statement. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  In words: For any type X equipped with a metric space structure, and for subsets A, B of X, if A and B are closed (hA, hB) and disjoint (h), then A and B are separated (in the topological sense captured by Mathlib's `Separated A B`). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: If A and B are disjoint closed sets in some metric space X, prove that they are separated. The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes X is a metric space, A and B are sets, A and B are closed and disjoint, and concludes they are separated.
- In Mathlib, `Separated A B` is the standard notion (disjoint closures), which aligns with the usual definition. For closed sets, this is directly implied by disjointness.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is not generalized improperly nor specialized beyond the given context (it asks for a metric space; the code requires a metric space). The conclusion matches the intended meaning of “separated.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_13 {a b : ℕ → ℝ}` introduces two sequences a and b of real numbers.
- Hypotheses `ha : Summable fun n => |a n|` and `hb : Summable fun n => |b n|` state that the series formed by the absolute values of a and b are summable (i.e., both series converge absolutely).
- The conclusion `Summable fun k => |∑ i in Finset.range (k+1), a i * b (k - i)|` asserts that the sequence defined by `c k = ∑_{i=0}^{k} a i * b (k - i)` is absolutely summable, i.e., the series ∑_k |c k| converges. Here `Finset.range (k+1)` enumerates i = 0, 1, ..., k, and `k - i` is the natural subtraction which for i ≤ k coincides with the usual difference, so this is exactly the Cauchy product coefficient.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely.”
- The Lean theorem assumes absolute convergence of the two input series and concludes absolute convergence of their Cauchy product, precisely matching the statement. It explicitly defines the Cauchy product coefficients as finite sums over i = 0..k and then asserts summability of the absolute values of these coefficients.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement is specialized to real sequences (ℝ), whereas the natural language statement could be understood over ℝ or ℂ (or more general normed fields). This is a benign specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem with a (sorry) proof placeholder. The semantics of the theorem statement itself are faithful.
- No other discrepancies found.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (with a slight specialization to ℝ).

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem impossible_ordered_field : ¬∃ o : Ordering, IsOrderedField ℂ o := by sorry` states: ""It is not the case that there exists an `o : Ordering` such that `IsOrderedField ℂ o` holds."" The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Assessment of definitions and usage:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field."" Mathematically, this is usually formalized as: ""There is no linear order on ℂ making it a (linearly) ordered field,"" equivalently `¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField ℂ)` or a quantified statement over orders `≤ : ℂ → ℂ → Prop` satisfying ordered field axioms.
- The code uses `o : Ordering`. In Lean, `Ordering` is an inductive type with values `lt | eq | gt` used as outputs of comparison functions, not a structure encoding a binary relation or an order on a type. An order on ℂ would be given by a relation `≤ : ℂ → ℂ → Prop` with axioms, or by a typeclass instance `LinearOrderedField ℂ`. Thus quantifying over `o : Ordering` is conceptually wrong for ""an order on ℂ"".
- The predicate `IsOrderedField` with signature `IsOrderedField ℂ o` does not exist in Mathlib. No auxiliary definition is provided; hence the statement as written will not compile. Even if one were to introduce a placeholder definition, it would be vacuous unless it truly encoded the ordered field axioms relative to a proper order structure on ℂ.

Faithfulness check:
- The intended formalization should quantify over a linear order structure (e.g., `¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField ℂ)`) or over relations `≤` with the ordered field axioms. The provided code instead quantifies over a single value `o : Ordering`, which cannot represent an order on ℂ, and uses a non-existent predicate `IsOrderedField`. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.
- Additionally, the theorem contains `sorry`, but per the auditing guidelines, missing proofs are acceptable as long as the statement is faithful. Here, the primary issue is the incorrect and non-existent formalization of the order concept, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is not faithful to the natural language statement. It uses an incorrect type (`Ordering`) and a non-existent predicate (`IsOrderedField`). Even if one tried to define `IsOrderedField` ad hoc, with `o : Ordering` it cannot capture the notion of an order on ℂ. A faithful version would be something like `theorem : ¬ (Nonempty (LinearOrderedField ℂ))` or `¬ ∃ (inst : LinearOrderedField ℂ), True`.

Grade rationale: This makes up (or relies on) non-existent/vacuous definitions and quantifies over the wrong notion of order; even if fixed superficially, the type of `o` must change. Hence a low grade is appropriate.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- The comment explains the intended interpretation: identify ℝ^1 with ℝ and the dot product with multiplication, and notes that the correct statement requires x ≠ 0.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_1_18b (x : ℝ) (hx : x ≠ 0) : ¬∃ y : ℝ, y ≠ 0 ∧ x * y = 0` states: for a real number x, assuming x ≠ 0, there does not exist a real y such that y ≠ 0 and x * y = 0. This matches the property that ℝ has no zero divisors.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the only object is the theorem.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement: ""If k = 1 and x ∈ R^k, prove that there does not exist y ∈ R^k such that y ≠ 0 but x · y = 0."" Interpreting k = 1, this becomes a statement in ℝ with dot product equal to multiplication: “For x ∈ ℝ, there does not exist y ∈ ℝ with y ≠ 0 and x*y = 0.”
- As written, this is false when x = 0 (since then any y gives x*y = 0), so typically one must assume x ≠ 0.
- The Lean code includes exactly that extra hypothesis `(hx : x ≠ 0)`. Thus the code proves the corrected/conditional statement: if x ≠ 0, there is no nonzero y with x*y = 0.
- The identification of ℝ^1 with ℝ and dot product with multiplication is standard and faithful.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Difference: The Lean theorem adds the necessary hypothesis x ≠ 0, whereas the natural language statement (as given) omits it. Therefore, the code proves a strictly weaker (conditional) statement than the universal claim over all x.
- Aside from that, the formalization (using ℝ instead of ℝ^1 and multiplication instead of dot product) is appropriate and faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the theorem statement is legitimate.

Conclusion: The code is almost the same but not faithful to the statement as written, due to the added hypothesis x ≠ 0. Hence, it does not pass as a faithful translation, though it is the correct version of the intended mathematical claim.

  Natural language: For a natural number k, and vectors x, y given as functions from `Fin k` to `ℝ` (i.e., k-tuples of real numbers), the theorem asserts the parallelogram identity involving the norm: the square of the norm of x+y plus the square of the norm of x−y equals 2 times the square of the norm of x plus 2 times the square of the norm of y.

2) Does this match the original statement?
- The original statement is the parallelogram law in ℝ^k with the standard Euclidean norm: |x+y|^2 + |x−y|^2 = 2|x|^2 + 2|y|^2 for x, y ∈ ℝ^k.
- The code models ℝ^k as `Fin k → ℝ`, which is fine as a set-theoretic identification of k-tuples.
- However, the crucial issue is the norm. In Mathlib, the type `(Fin k → ℝ)` carries the Pi-type norm (the sup-norm/∞-norm) by default, not the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm. The parallelogram law generally fails for the sup norm when k ≥ 2. The Euclidean norm (ℓ2) is obtained in Mathlib by the type alias `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`, which equips the space with an inner product and the corresponding ℓ2 norm. Simply writing `(Fin k → ℝ)` does not pick up that inner product norm.
- Therefore, the Lean statement as written uses the wrong norm and does not faithfully represent the Euclidean parallelogram identity in ℝ^k. In fact, the stated equality is false under the sup norm.

3) Final check – same or different?
- Different. The natural language statement is about ℝ^k with the Euclidean norm. The Lean statement is about `(Fin k → ℝ)` with the Pi/sup norm. These are not the same norms, and the identity does not hold in general with the sup norm. There are no auxiliary definitions, but the core mismatch (norm) is fundamental.
- A faithful Lean formalization would use `x y : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)` (or otherwise ensure the Euclidean/inner-product-induced norm), or explicitly rely on `InnerProductSpace` structure to state the parallelogram law.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to using the wrong normed structure.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library, including metric spaces, uniform continuity, and Cauchy sequences.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_4_11a {X Y : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y] {f : X → Y} (hf : UniformContinuous f) : ∀ (x : ℕ → X), IsCauchySeq x → IsCauchySeq (f ∘ x)` states:
  - Let X and Y be types equipped with metric space structures.
  - Let f : X → Y be a function that is uniformly continuous (`UniformContinuous f`).
  - Then for every sequence `x : ℕ → X`, if `x` is a Cauchy sequence in X (`IsCauchySeq x`), the composed sequence `f ∘ x` (i.e., n ↦ f(x n)) is a Cauchy sequence in Y (`IsCauchySeq (f ∘ x)`).
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but per the auditing guidelines we only judge the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Suppose f is a uniformly continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric space Y and prove that {f(x_n)} is a Cauchy sequence in Y for every Cauchy sequence {x_n} in X.""
- Lean: Exactly captures this: f uniformly continuous between metric spaces X and Y; for every Cauchy sequence `x` in X, the image sequence `f ∘ x` is Cauchy in Y.

Checks and potential discrepancies:
- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `MetricSpace`, `UniformContinuous`, and `IsCauchySeq`—all legitimate.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement.
- The sequence `{f(x_n)}` is represented as `f ∘ x`, which is faithful.
- No extraneous hypotheses (e.g., completeness) are added.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same. No differences found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard library.
- Comment explains the statement: Every continuous open mapping of ℝ into ℝ is monotonic.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_15 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h_cont : Continuous f) (h_open : IsOpenMap f) : Monotone f ∨ Antitone f := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any function f from ℝ to ℝ, if f is continuous and an open map (i.e., it sends open sets to open sets), then f is monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Domain/codomain: ℝ → ℝ matches ℝ^1 into ℝ^1.
- Hypotheses: `Continuous f` matches “continuous”; `IsOpenMap f` matches “open mapping”. No extra or missing conditions.
- Conclusion: `Monotone f ∨ Antitone f` captures “is monotonic” in the standard sense used in analysis (either nondecreasing or nonincreasing). This aligns with typical usage in Rudin.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; standard Mathlib notions are used.

3) Final check for differences:
- No change of meaning or scope. The theorem is neither a strict strengthening nor weakening. It does not require surjectivity (which is not part of the natural-language statement). It asserts non-strict monotonicity, which is the conventional meaning of “monotonic” in this context. Everything matches.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib; open Set Filter; variable {k : ℕ}: Set up the environment, using sets, filters, and working in ℝ^k represented as (Fin k → ℝ).

- def isCondensationPoint (E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)) (x : Fin k → ℝ) : Prop := ∀ U, U ∈ nhds x → ¬ (E ∩ U).Countable
  Natural language: x is a condensation point of E if for every neighborhood U of x, the intersection E ∩ U is uncountable (i.e., not countable). This matches the usual definition (neighborhoods via the neighborhood filter; using “not Countable” to mean uncountable).

- theorem Rudin_exercise_2_27b (E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)) (hE : ¬ E.Countable) : (E \ {x | isCondensationPoint E x}).Countable := by sorry
  Natural language: If E ⊆ ℝ^k is uncountable, then the set of points of E that are not condensation points (i.e., E minus the set of condensation points) is countable. The set {x | isCondensationPoint E x} is exactly the set P of condensation points of E.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- Original: Suppose E ⊆ ℝ^k is uncountable; let P be the set of condensation points of E; prove that at most countably many points of E are not in P.
- Lean: Assumes E is uncountable (¬ E.Countable), defines the notion of condensation point, and concludes (E \ P).Countable. This is exactly “at most countably many points of E are not in P.”

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags
- The representation ℝ^k as (Fin k → ℝ) is standard in mathlib.
- The definition of condensation point uses neighborhoods via nhds x (possibly non-open), which is equivalent to the usual open-neighborhood formulation.
- The statement is exactly the natural language claim.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the auxiliary definition is legitimate and matches the intended concept.
- Slight edge case k = 0 is harmless: the hypothesis ¬ E.Countable can’t hold in ℝ^0, but the implication is still correct; this is a standard acceptable generality.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib; fine.
- The docstring restates the natural language theorem about continuous f, g on metric spaces X → Y, E dense in X, equality on E implies equality on X.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_4b {X : Type _} {Y : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y] {f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) {E : Set X} (hE : Dense E) (hfg : ∀ p ∈ E, g p = f p) : ∀ p : X, g p = f p := by sorry`
  - X, Y are types with MetricSpace structures: matches “metric space X” and “metric space Y.”
  - f, g : X → Y with hypotheses `hf : Continuous f` and `hg : Continuous g`: matches “f and g be continuous mappings.”

  - Conclusion `∀ p : X, g p = f p`: matches “then g(p) = f(p) for all p ∈ X.”
  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions; we only verify the statement translation.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The Lean theorem precisely captures the hypothesis and conclusion of the natural language statement. It assumes both f and g are continuous maps between metric spaces, E is dense, and equality holds on E, concluding equality everywhere. This is the standard result (using that metric spaces are Hausdorff so the equalizer is closed).

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The only minor discrepancy is a likely typo in the natural language statement where “for all p ∈ P” clearly intends E; the Lean uses E consistently. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; there are no extra hypotheses or missing conditions relative to the given statement. Using MetricSpace rather than just TopologicalSpace is a specialization consistent with the problem statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- The Lean statement precisely matches the natural language statement: a function on ℝ with the given global Lipschitz-like bound relative to squared distance must be constant.

  Natural language: Let f be a function from ℝ to ℝ, and let E be a subset of ℝ. Assume E is bounded (hE : IsBounded E) and f is uniformly continuous on E (hf : UniformContinuousOn f E). Then f is bounded on E (IsBoundedOn f E). In Mathlib, IsBoundedOn f E means the image f '' E is a bounded subset of ℝ, which matches the usual notion that there exists M with |f x| ≤ M for all x ∈ E in ℝ.

2) Fidelity to the original statement:
- Domain/codomain: f : ℝ → ℝ matches “real function” and R^1.

- The Lean theorem assumes g is differentiable everywhere and that |g'| ≤ M holds globally, which matches the usual interpretation of “bounded derivative.” Including `0 ≤ M` is consistent since any bound M for |g'| must be nonnegative.
- Conclusion: There exists ε0 > 0 such that for every ε with |ε| < ε0, f(x) = x + ε g(x) is injective.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: Suppose a real function on ℝ satisfies `lim_{h→0} f(x+h) − f(x−h) = 0` for every `x`. Show that `f` does not need to be continuous. This is typically read as: the given limit condition does not imply continuity; i.e., there exists a counterexample function with the property that is not continuous.
- The Lean statement is precisely the existential version: there exists `f` with the limit property for all `x` and not continuous. This matches the intended meaning of “does not need to be continuous.”
- All notions used (`Tendsto` to `nhds 0`, subtraction on ℝ, `Continuous`) are standard and correct.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem directly states the claim.

- If the natural language statement holds with δ0 and strict >, then automatically for the same δ0 we have ≥ δ0, so the Lean statement holds.
- Conversely, if the Lean statement holds with δ0 and ≥, then choosing δ := δ0/2 > 0 yields dist p q ≥ δ0 > δ, so the strict version holds. Thus the existence of such a δ is equivalent in the two formulations.

Other checks:
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions: `IsCompact`, `IsClosed`, `Disjoint`, `MetricSpace`, and `dist`. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the intended mathematical content.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_21 {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X] (E : ℕ → Set X)`:
  We have a complete metric space X and a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of subsets E n of X.
- `(h_closed : ∀ n, IsClosed (E n))`:
  Each E n is closed.
- `(h_nonempty : ∀ n, (E n).Nonempty)`:
  Each E n is nonempty.
- `(h_bdd : ∀ n, Bounded (E n))`:
  Each E n is bounded.
- `(h_mono : ∀ n, E n ⊇ E (n+1))`:
  The sequence is nested decreasing: E n ⊇ E_{n+1} for all n.
- `(h_diam : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n, n ≥ N → ∀ x y, x ∈ E n → y ∈ E n → dist x y < ε)`:
  Instead of using an explicit diameter function, the diameter→0 condition is stated directly: for every ε>0, eventually (for all n≥N) all pairs of points x,y in E n satisfy dist(x,y) < ε.
- Conclusion: `∃! x, x ∈ ⋂ n, E n`:
  There exists exactly one point in the intersection of all E n.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: In a complete metric space X, if {E_n} is a sequence of closed, nonempty, bounded sets with E_n ⊇ E_{n+1} and diam(E_n) → 0, then the intersection over n=1..∞ consists of exactly one point.
- The Lean statement matches all hypotheses: complete metric space, closed/nonempty/bounded sets, nested decreasing property, and the diameter→0 condition. The diameter condition is expressed in an equivalent ε-N form: eventually all pairwise distances in E_n are < ε; this is equivalent to diam(E_n) → 0 (using the standard sup-definition of diameter; one can replace ε by ε/2 if worrying about strict vs non-strict inequalities of the supremum).
- Indexing starts at ℕ (0) rather than 1. This is a harmless shift: since E_0 ⊇ E_1, intersecting over all n ≥ 0 equals intersecting over n ≥ 1 (adding a superset to an intersection does not shrink it).
- The conclusion `∃! x, x ∈ ⋂ n, E n` precisely states that the intersection contains exactly one point.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all predicates are Mathlib concepts. The presence of `by sorry` is acceptable for this task (we are auditing the statement, not the proof).

3) Final check of equivalence:
- All components (completeness, closedness, nonemptiness, boundedness, nestedness, diameter→0, and the uniqueness of the point in the intersection) align with the original statement.
- Minor indexing difference (ℕ vs starting at 1) is negligible and mathematically equivalent in this context.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This states: There exists a subset E of ℝ and a function f from the subtype E (i.e., a function defined on E) to ℝ such that f is continuous (with respect to the subspace topology on E) and there does not exist any continuous function g : ℝ → ℝ that agrees with f on all points of E (formally, for all x in E, g(x) = f(x)). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable here since we're auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- Natural language: There exists E ⊆ ℝ and a real continuous function f defined on E, such that there does not exist a continuous real function g on ℝ with g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.
- Lean statement: Exactly asserts existence of E : Set ℝ and f : E → ℝ with `Continuous f` (continuity on the subspace E) and the nonexistence of a continuous g : ℝ → ℝ agreeing with f on E. This matches precisely.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement.
- The use of subtype `↥E` and `Continuous f` correctly captures continuity on E.
- The quantification `∀ x : ↥E, g (x : ℝ) = f x` exactly states that g restricts to f on E.
- No extraneous assumptions or generalizations/specializations are present.
Thus, the Lean code is a faithful formal translation of the natural language statement.

- `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted; acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Overall faithfulness:
The natural language statement assumes f'(x), g'(x) exist, g'(x) ≠ 0, and f(x) = g(x) = 0, and concludes lim_{t→x} f(t)/g(t) = f'(x)/g'(x). The Lean theorem exactly encodes these hypotheses using `HasDerivAt` for existence of derivatives with values a and b, asserts b ≠ 0, f x = 0, g x = 0, and concludes `Tendsto` to `a / b`. This matches the intended local L'Hôpital-type result at a point. The domain is ℝ, which aligns with the natural phrasing.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No extra hypotheses are added beyond the natural language statement.
- The conclusion is precisely the limit equality.
- Both use two-sided limits at x in ℝ.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_17 {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We fix a real-valued function f on ℝ.
- `(h_cont : ContDiffOn ℝ 3 f (Set.Icc (-1:ℝ) 1))`: Assumption that f is C^3 (three times continuously differentiable) on the closed interval [-1,1].

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original hypothesis: f is real, three times differentiable on [-1,1], with f(-1)=0, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, and f′(0)=0. The Lean hypothesis uses `ContDiffOn ℝ 3` on [-1,1], which is a slightly stronger requirement (three times continuously differentiable) compared to merely three times differentiable. All value and derivative conditions match exactly, and the conclusion is the existence of x in (-1,1) with f^{(3)}(x) ≥ 3, which matches the natural language statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The only difference is the mild strengthening of regularity: `ContDiffOn` vs. mere three-times differentiable. The domain and pointwise conditions, as well as the conclusion, agree. There are no vacuous definitions or placeholders; the statement is legitimate and uses standard Mathlib notions. This is an acceptable slight specialization and faithfully represents the problem.

  This defines a collection of subsets S of ℝ × ℝ such that S is equal to the product of two open intervals (a, b) and (c, d) in ℝ with rational endpoints a, b, c, d ∈ ℚ and a < b, c < d. In other words, this is exactly the collection {(a,b) × (c,d) | a,b,c,d ∈ ℚ, a<b, c<d}.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_16_6 : IsTopologicalBasis rational_rectangle_basis_set ∧ Countable rational_rectangle_basis_set := by sorry`
  This states that the collection defined above is a topological basis for ℝ × ℝ (with the standard/product topology) and that this collection is countable.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The statement asks to show that the countable collection {(a, b) × (c, d) | a < b and c < d, and a, b, c, d are rational} is a basis for ℝ^2. The Lean code defines exactly this collection and asserts two properties: (1) it is a topological basis for ℝ × ℝ (which is ℝ^2), and (2) it is countable. This matches the natural language statement precisely.

Step 3: Final check for differences and red flags.
- The set defined uses `Set.Ioo` for open intervals, matching (a, b), and `Set.prod` for the Cartesian product, matching ×.
- The type is ℝ × ℝ, which corresponds to ℝ^2.
- The theorem asserts both that it is a basis (IsTopologicalBasis) and that it is countable (Countable), exactly as required.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary definition is legitimate.
- No unnecessary generalizations or specializations are present.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem R_mul_R_lexico_metrizable : MetrizableSpace (R × R) := by sorry`
  This asserts that the type `(R × R)` carries a metrizable topology, i.e., the existing (typeclass-provided) `TopologicalSpace` instance on `R × R` is metrizable. In Mathlib, for `R = Real`, the default topology on `R × R` is the product topology of the standard topology on `Real`. There is no mention in the type of any alternative topology (such as the lexicographic order topology), nor is any new topology instance introduced. Thus, as stated, it claims “the product topology on `R × R` is metrizable.”

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to show that `R × R` with the dictionary (lexicographic) order topology is metrizable. This is a different topology from the standard product topology. The code does not switch the topology to the lexicographic order topology (e.g., via a `Lex` type synonym or by providing an `OrderTopology` instance and using it), so it does not formalize the intended claim. Comments in the code mention the lexicographic order, but comments do not affect the formal statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The Lean statement refers to the default/product topology on `R × R`, while the natural language statement explicitly concerns the lexicographic order topology. Therefore, the translation is not faithful. Additionally, the identifier `R` is undeclared (should be `Real`), but even overlooking that (as per the assumption that the code compiles), the topology mismatch remains the decisive issue.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [LinearOrder Y] [TopologicalSpace Y] [OrderTopology Y]` sets up two types X and Y. X has a topology. Y has a linear order and the order topology (i.e., the topology on Y is the order topology coming from its linear order). This matches ""Y be an ordered set in the order topology."" The extra `[TopologicalSpace Y]` together with `[OrderTopology Y]` ensures the topology on Y is indeed the order topology.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_18_8a {f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : IsClosed { x | f x ≤ g x }` states: Given continuous maps f and g from X to Y, the set of x in X such that f x ≤ g x is closed in X. This directly matches the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language: ""Let Y be an ordered set in the order topology. Let f, g: X → Y be continuous. Show that the set {x | f(x) ≤ g(x)} is closed in X."" The Lean statement precisely assumes Y is linearly ordered with the order topology, f and g are continuous, and concludes that the set {x | f x ≤ g x} is closed in X. This is exactly the same claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- Lean assumes a LinearOrder on Y (total order), which aligns with the usual meaning of ""ordered set"" in the context of the order topology (typically a linearly ordered set). No extra hypotheses beyond the standard setting are added.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement with standard Mathlib classes. The presence of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable for auditing the statement; it does not affect the faithfulness of the translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem concerns an arbitrary open set U ⊆ ℝ (hU : IsOpen U).
- It asserts there exists a set S of subsets of ℝ such that:
  - Countable S: S is at most countable.
  - (∀ I ∈ S, ∃ a b : ℝ, a < b ∧ I = Ioo a b): every element I of S is an open interval of the form (a, b) with finite real endpoints a < b.
  - (∀ I J, I ∈ S → J ∈ S → (I = J ∨ I ∩ J = ∅)): any two members of S are either equal or disjoint (i.e., effectively pairwise disjoint, allowing duplicates).
  - U = ⋃₀ S: U is the union (sUnion) of all sets in S.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Every open set in ℝ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments.""
- Standard interpretation: an open set in ℝ decomposes into at most countably many pairwise disjoint open intervals (its connected components), and these open intervals may be of the forms (a, b), (a, ∞), (−∞, b), or ℝ.
- The Lean statement requires each interval to be of the form Ioo a b with a, b ∈ ℝ and a < b (i.e., bounded open intervals only). This excludes unbounded open intervals and ℝ itself.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Main discrepancy: The Lean code excludes unbounded components like (a, ∞), (−∞, b), or ℝ, which are allowed (and sometimes necessary) in the standard theorem. For example, U = (0, ∞) is open but cannot be written as a disjoint union of bounded open intervals whose union equals (0, ∞).
- Countability and disjointness conditions match the usual meaning of ""at most countable"" and ""disjoint collection."" Allowing I = J in the disjointness clause is harmless.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a strict (and incorrect) specialization of the original statement: it demands all components be bounded open intervals, which is not generally true for arbitrary open sets in ℝ.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation due to the exclusion of unbounded open intervals (and ℝ) as possible components.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem generate_subbasis_eq_sInf {X : Type*} (𝒜 : Set (Set X)) (h𝒜 : IsSubbasis 𝒜) :` introduces a type `X`, a set of subsets `𝒜 : Set (Set X)`, and an assumption `h𝒜` that `𝒜` is a subbasis. This mirrors the natural language ""if A is a subbasis for a topology on X"".
- `generateFrom 𝒜` denotes the topology generated by `𝒜`.
- `sInf { t : TopologicalSpace X | ∀ U ∈ 𝒜, IsOpen t U }` denotes the infimum (intersection) of all topologies `t` on `X` such that every `U ∈ 𝒜` is open in `t` — equivalently, all topologies on `X` that contain `𝒜`.
- The equality `generateFrom 𝒜 = sInf { ... }` is exactly the assertion that the topology generated by `𝒜` equals the intersection of all topologies on `X` containing `𝒜`.

Faithfulness assessment:
- This is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. The use of `sInf` correctly captures the intersection of topologies, and the predicate `∀ U ∈ 𝒜, IsOpen t U` correctly encodes ""contain 𝒜"".
- The hypothesis `h𝒜 : IsSubbasis 𝒜` matches the natural language “if 𝒜 is a subbasis...”. It is likely not needed for the equality, but its presence is consistent with the statement and does not harm correctness.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code relies on standard Mathlib notions (`generateFrom`, `TopologicalSpace`, `IsOpen`, `sInf`).

Final check:
- The formal and natural statements coincide in mathematical meaning. Any slight over-assumption (providing `IsSubbasis 𝒜`) is consistent with the premise of the natural language statement and acceptable per the guidelines.

- theorem Munkres_exercise_22_2a (p : X → Y) (hp : Continuous p) (f : Y → X) (hf : Continuous f) (hpf : p ∘ f = id) : QuotientMap p := by sorry: This states that given a continuous map p : X → Y and a continuous map f : Y → X such that p ∘ f = id (the identity on Y by type inference), then p is a quotient map. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asserts: If p is continuous and there exists a continuous f with p ∘ f = id_Y, then p is a quotient map. The Lean theorem has exactly these hypotheses (hp, hf, hpf) and concludes QuotientMap p. The identity is correctly expressed as id on Y via types.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No extra assumptions are added; no generalization or specialization beyond the original.
- The symbol QuotientMap p is the standard Mathlib predicate meaning ""p is a quotient map"" (includes surjectivity, which is implied by having a right inverse). The composition and identity are correctly typed.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- The docstring states the intended lemma: If Y is a subspace of X, and A is a subset of Y, then the topology A inherits as a subspace of Y is the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of X.
- `theorem subspace_subspace_eq {X : Type*} (t : TopologicalSpace X) {Y : Set X} {A : Set Y} :` sets up X with a topology t, a subset Y of X, and a subset A of Y.
- The goal is an equality of topologies on the type A (the subtype of Y):
  • Left side: `TopologicalSpace.induced (Subtype.val : A → X) t` is the topology on A induced by viewing A as a subset of X (via the inclusion A → X).
  • Right side: `TopologicalSpace.induced (Subtype.val : A → Y) (TopologicalSpace.induced (Subtype.val : Y → X) t)` is the topology obtained by first giving Y the subspace topology from X, i.e., `TopologicalSpace.induced (Subtype.val : Y → X) t`, and then inducing again along the inclusion A → Y.
- `:= by sorry` leaves the proof omitted; only the statement matters for translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly formalizes the natural language claim: for Y ⊆ X and A ⊆ Y, the induced topology on A from X equals the induced topology obtained by first inducing to Y (subspace topology on Y from X) and then to A (subspace of Y). This is the standard equivalence of subspace topologies under nested subsets.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. The Lean code uses standard Mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace.induced, subtype inclusions) and does not introduce any vacuous or placeholder definitions. The presence of `sorry` is only for the proof and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem connected_union_of_connected_with_common_point {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {ι : Type*} {A : Set X} {Aα : ι → Set X}`: We fix a topological space X, an index type ι, a subset A of X, and a family of subsets Aα of X indexed by ι.
- `(hA : IsConnected A)`: A is connected (as a subspace of X).
- `(hAα : ∀ i, IsConnected (Aα i))`: For each index i, the subset Aα i is connected (as a subspace of X).

- `IsConnected (A ∪ ⋃ i, Aα i)`: The conclusion is that the union of A with the union over all i of Aα i is connected.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement: Given a collection {A_α} of connected subspaces of X and a connected subset A of X; if A ∩ A_α ≠ ∅ for all α, then A ∪ (⋃ A_α) is connected.
- The Lean code matches this exactly: it encodes connectedness of A and each Aα i via `IsConnected`, the nonempty intersection condition via `(A ∩ Aα i).Nonempty`, and concludes `IsConnected` of `A ∪ ⋃ i, Aα i`.
- Using `Set` and `IsConnected` in Mathlib corresponds to connected subspaces. The big union `⋃ i, Aα i` is exactly the union over the collection.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable per the task as we're auditing translation, not proof.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is the same as the natural language statement. It even allows an empty index set ι, in which case the conclusion reduces to `IsConnected A`, consistent with the premises; this is a standard and acceptable edge case handling.
- No discrepancies found.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is that the union of a family of topologies on X need not be a topology. The code provides a concrete counterexample on X = Fin 3: two specific topologies T1 and T2 whose union is not closed under unions (since {0} and {1} are in T1 ∪ T2 but {0} ∪ {1} is not), hence not a topology. The custom predicate is_topology accurately captures the standard axioms of a topology (empty set and whole space included, arbitrary unions, binary intersections). This is a faithful formalization of the claim via a specific counterexample.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code slightly specializes X to Fin 3, which is appropriate because the statement only requires exhibiting a counterexample (i.e., showing ""need not"" by example). 
- The use of a custom is_topology predicate rather than Mathlib's TopologicalSpace structure is acceptable and faithful, as it encodes the correct axioms. There are no vacuous definitions; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful.
- The theorem ends with a sorry (no proof), but per the auditing rules we only check translation faithfulness, not proof. The statement matches the intended mathematical content.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses the Mathlib library.
- Comment: States the exercise: If f: X → X is continuous and X = [0,1], then f has a fixed point.
- `open Set`: Opens namespace for set-theoretic notation.
- `theorem munkres_exercise_24_3a {f : ℝ → ℝ} (h_cont : Continuous f) (h_range : ∀ x ∈ (Icc (0 : ℝ) (1 : ℝ)), f x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) (1 : ℝ)) : ∃ x ∈ (Icc (0 : ℝ) (1 : ℝ)), f x = x := by sorry`
  Translation: Let f: ℝ → ℝ be a continuous function. Assume that for every x in the closed interval [0,1], f(x) is also in [0,1] (i.e., f maps [0,1] into itself). Then there exists x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) = x. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Step 2: Assess if it matches the original statement.
Original: Let f: X → X be continuous. If X = [0,1], then there exists x with f(x) = x (a fixed point).
- In the original, f: [0,1] → [0,1] continuous (relative topology). In the Lean code, f is a continuous ℝ → ℝ map, with the extra hypothesis that it maps [0,1] into [0,1]. This is a standard formalization: the range condition `h_range` ensures f: [0,1] → [0,1] in effect. Requiring global continuity on ℝ is a slight strengthening of the hypothesis (stronger than continuity restricted to [0,1]), which is acceptable.
- Conclusion in Lean exactly states existence of a fixed point x lying in [0,1].
Thus, the statement is faithfully captured.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions at all.
- Interval used is `Icc (0) (1)`, i.e., [0,1], matching the problem.
- The only difference is assuming global continuity on ℝ, which is a harmless strengthening and still a faithful formalization of the exercise.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The file imports Mathlib and opens the Set namespace.
- It defines a predicate `is_topology {X} (T : Set (Set X)) : Prop` which says a collection T of subsets of X is a topology if:
  - ∅ ∈ T and univ ∈ T.
  - For any U, V ∈ T, the intersection U ∩ V ∈ T (closure under finite intersections is captured by binary intersection and induction).
  - For any subfamily S ⊆ T, the union over S, `sUnion S`, is in T (closure under arbitrary unions).
  This is a faithful definition of a topology on X.
- The theorem `exists_unique_largest_topology` takes a family T : ι → Set (Set X) and a hypothesis `h : ∀ i, is_topology (T i)`, i.e., each T i is a topology on X. It then asserts there exists a unique S : Set (Set X) such that:
  - `is_topology S` (S is a topology on X),
  - `S ⊆ (⋂ i, T i)` (S is contained in every T i), and
  - For every S' with `is_topology S'` and `S' ⊆ (⋂ i, T i)`, we have `S' ⊆ S` (S is the largest topology among those contained in all T i).
  This is exactly the universal property of the largest topology contained in all the T i. Note the conclusion does not assert `⋂ i, T i` is itself a topology, but it states the existence and uniqueness of the largest topology contained in the intersection.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The statement: ""Let T_α be a family of topologies on X. Show that there is a unique largest topology on X contained in all the collections T_α."" The code formalizes:
- A family of topologies on X: `T : ι → Set (Set X)` with `∀ i, is_topology (T i)`.
- The existence and uniqueness of a largest topology contained in all T i: existence of `S` with `is_topology S`, `S ⊆ ⋂ T i` and maximality `∀ S' (is_topology S' → S' ⊆ ⋂ T i → S' ⊆ S)`.
This is a faithful formalization.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The auxiliary definition `is_topology` is legitimate and standard.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; no cheating definitions.
- The theorem statement matches the natural language claim precisely. Although the docstring mentions that the intersection itself is a topology (which is true), the theorem as stated suffices for the claim of a unique largest topology contained in all T_α, and remains faithful to the requested result.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  2) The topology generated by rat_open_intervals equals the standard topology on ℝ.
  The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement precisely captures the intended result.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement says: Show that the collection {(a,b) | a < b, a and b rational} is a basis that generates the standard topology on ℝ. The Lean statement does exactly this: it defines that collection as the set of open intervals with rational endpoints and then states (i) it is a topological basis for the standard topology and (ii) the topology generated from it equals the standard topology. This matches the intended meaning; in fact, (i) alone already conveys that it is a basis for the standard topology, and (ii) explicitly states the “generates the standard topology” part.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The collection is correctly modeled as sets Ioo (a : ℝ) (b : ℝ) with a, b ∈ ℚ and a < b. This matches (a, b) with rational endpoints.
- The target property is exactly “basis that generates the standard topology,” expressed as IsTopologicalBasis (for the current topology) and equality with generateFrom.
- No placeholders or vacuous definitions are used; rat_open_intervals is a legitimate definition, and the theorem statement uses standard Mathlib notions.
There are no discrepancies; the formal statement is faithful to the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement asks to show that the collection T_∞ need not be a topology on X. Providing a specific set X (here ℕ) and a family of sets each in T_∞ whose union is not in T_∞ proves that T_∞ is not closed under arbitrary unions, hence not a topology. The code defines T_inf exactly as in the statement and asserts the existence of such a counterexample on ℕ. This is a faithful formalization of the requirement to show it is not necessarily a topology.

3) Final check differences:
- The code uses a concrete counterexample on X = ℕ, which is exactly what “does not need to be a topology” calls for (a counterexample). It does not claim failure for all X, which would be stronger than required.
- All auxiliary definitions are legitimate; no placeholders or vacuous definitions. The use of (univ \ U) to denote complement is standard and matches “X − U”.
- The theorem uses an existence statement about a family s to demonstrate failure of closure under unions, which suffices to show T_inf is not a topology.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation.

The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for this audit since we're assessing the statement, not the proof.

2) Does the Lean statement match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: Let p: X → Y be a closed continuous surjective map with compact fibers (a perfect map). Show that if Y is compact, then X is compact.
- Lean: Exactly the same hypotheses: continuous, closed map, surjective, compact fibers, and Y compact. Conclusion: X is compact. This directly formalizes the statement without adding or removing assumptions.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Surjectivity is included both in the natural language and Lean.
- Compactness notion uses `CompactSpace` for spaces and `IsCompact` for sets, which is standard in Mathlib.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only the theorem statement.

- The Lean code asserts the inequality in ℝ with no proviso. It therefore does not handle cases where a limsup is infinite (±∞), since ℝ cannot represent ±∞. The proviso “not of the form ∞ − ∞” is omitted rather than encoded, and the target type is ℝ instead of the extended reals.
- The code also omits an explicit mention of the filter (atTop) for n → ∞; it is implicit in `Filter.limsup` for sequences. This is likely fine as a standard formalization shorthand.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- The Lean statement is a specialization to the case where limsups are real (finite) and gives the inequality without the side condition. The original statement allows extended real limsups and explicitly rules out the undefined ∞ − ∞ case. Hence the Lean code does not faithfully capture the full intended generality or the proviso. It is a reasonable specialization but not fully faithful.

Issues found:
- Missing proviso about ∞ − ∞.
- Uses ℝ instead of extended reals, excluding cases where one (or both) limsups are infinite.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful; close specialization but omits an important condition and the extended-real setting.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_23_11 {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : X → Y) (hq : QuotientMap p) (hfib : ∀ y, IsConnected (p ⁻¹' ({y} : Set Y))) (hY : ConnectedSpace Y) : ConnectedSpace X := by sorry`
  - We have topological spaces X and Y.
  - p : X → Y is a function.
  - `hq : QuotientMap p` asserts that p is a quotient map in the sense of Mathlib (Y has the coinduced topology via p; surjectivity is not built into the predicate but will follow from `hfib`).
  - `hfib : ∀ y, IsConnected (p ⁻¹' ({y} : Set Y))` says for every y in Y, the fiber p^{-1}({y}) (a subset of X) is connected (in Mathlib, `IsConnected s` is a predicate on subsets, and implies nonemptiness).
  - `hY : ConnectedSpace Y` says Y is connected as a topological space.
  - Conclusion: `ConnectedSpace X`, i.e., X is connected.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let p: X → Y be a quotient map. If each set p^{-1}({y}) is connected, and if Y is connected, then X is connected.
- Lean: Exactly formalizes this: p is a quotient map (`QuotientMap p`), each fiber is connected (`IsConnected (p ⁻¹' {y})`), Y is connected (`ConnectedSpace Y`), hence X is connected (`ConnectedSpace X`).
- The use of `IsConnected` on a subset matches the usual notion of “connected subset,” which includes nonemptiness, aligning with standard topology usage. This also implicitly forces surjectivity of p, consistent with usual quotient-map assumptions.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.
- The Mathlib notions used (`QuotientMap`, `IsConnected`, `ConnectedSpace`) are standard and appropriate.
- Any subtlety about surjectivity is handled by `hfib` since empty fibers would violate `IsConnected`.
- Therefore, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Line-by-line translation:
- `open Set`: We will use set-theoretic notation from Mathlib.
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: Work in a topological space X.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_23_6 {A C : Set X}` states: for subsets A, C of X, if `hC : IsConnected C` (the subset C is connected as a subspace), `h1 : (C ∩ A).Nonempty` (C meets A), and `h2 : (C ∩ (X \ A)).Nonempty` (C meets the complement of A), then `(C ∩ frontier A).Nonempty` (C meets the boundary/frontier of A).

Assessment of meaning:
- `IsConnected C` is the standard Mathlib notion for a connected subspace (subset) of X.
- `(C ∩ A).Nonempty` and `(C ∩ (X \ A)).Nonempty` state that C intersects both A and the complement of A. The natural language uses X − A; in Mathlib the complement is typically written `Aᶜ` or `univ \ A`. Here `X \ A` is clearly intended to denote the complement relative to the ambient space X, matching the natural language ""X − A"". Given the prompt says the code compiles, this is taken as the complement of A in X.
- `frontier A` is Mathlib's boundary of A, matching Bd A in the statement.

Whole translation vs original statement:
- The Lean theorem exactly captures: If C is a connected subspace of X that intersects both A and X − A, then C intersects the boundary of A. This is precisely the natural language statement.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement is given (with proof omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Final check:
- The mathematical content and quantification match perfectly. Terminology (frontier/boundary) aligns with Mathlib's definitions. The use of `IsConnected C` as a subset condition aligns with ""connected subspace"". Hence the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We work with topological spaces X and Y.
- `def restrict_map (p : X → Y) (A : Set X) (hA : IsOpen A) : A → p '' A := fun a => ⟨p a, ⟨a, a.2, rfl⟩⟩`: For a function p : X → Y and an open subset A of X, define the restricted map q from the subtype A to the subtype p '' A (the image of A under p) by q(a) = p(a). The term constructs an element of p '' A using the witness a ∈ A. The parameter hA is present but not used in the definition, which is fine since the function itself does not require A to be open.
- `theorem restrict_map_is_open ... : ∀ U : Set A, IsOpen U → IsOpen ((restrict_map p A hA) '' U : Set (p '' A)) := by sorry`: If p is an open map (formalized as: for every U ⊆ X, IsOpen U → IsOpen (p '' U)) and A is open in X, then for every open set U in the subspace A, the image of U under the restricted map is open in the subspace p '' A. This is precisely the statement that the restriction q : A → p '' A is an open map between the subspace topologies.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: If p : X → Y is an open map and A is open in X, then the restriction q : A → p(A) is an open map. The code encodes p being open via `hp : ∀ U, IsOpen U → IsOpen (p '' U)` and A being open via `hA : IsOpen A`. The restricted map is defined as `restrict_map p A hA : A → p '' A`. The theorem asserts that images of open sets in A under this map are open in the subspace p '' A. This matches the intended meaning that q is an open map between subspaces.
- The use of subtypes `A` and `p '' A` with their induced topologies exactly captures the subspace topologies implicit in the natural language statement. Using `IsOpen ((restrict_map ...) '' U : Set (p '' A))` asserts openness in the codomain subspace, which is the correct formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not use the `OpenMap p` structure but an equivalent explicit predicate `hp`, which is fully faithful.
- The map `restrict_map` has an unused `hA` parameter, but the definition itself is correct and not vacuous.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all constructs are standard Mathlib notions.
- Conclusion matches precisely: the restricted map is an open map between A and p(A) with subspace topologies.

Verdict: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `variable {α : Type*} [LinearOrder α] [TopologicalSpace α] [OrderTopology α]`: Fix a type α with a linear order, a topology, and assume that the topology is the order topology induced by that linear order (the standard Mathlib setup for order topologies).
- `theorem order_topology_regular : RegularSpace α := by sorry`: States the theorem that under these assumptions, α is a regular space. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says ""Show that every order topology is regular."" In Lean, this is formulated as: for any α with a linear order and the order topology, we have `RegularSpace α`. This matches exactly the intended mathematical content. The presence of `[TopologicalSpace α] [OrderTopology α]` is the standard way in Mathlib to indicate that the given topology on α is the order topology. No additional or missing hypotheses beyond the usual interpretation.

3) Final check:
The formal statement and the natural language statement are the same: every (linearly) ordered type equipped with its order topology is a regular space. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The small potential nuance about linear vs partial order is aligned with the standard meaning of “order topology,” which refers to linear orders. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- The limit point definition via open neighborhoods is standard and equivalent to the usual one.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X and Y are types with topological spaces; Y has a T2 (Hausdorff) structure: [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y]. This matches the hypothesis that Y is Hausdorff.
- A : Set X is a subset of X.
- f : A → Y is a function from the subtype A (with subspace topology) to Y; hf : Continuous f states f is continuous. This matches the assumption that f is continuous.
- g1 g2 : Subtype (closure A) → Y are two functions defined on the closure of A in X (as a subtype) to Y.
- hg1, hg2 assert that both g1 and g2 are continuous.
- h1: ∀ a : A, g1 ⟨(a : X), subset_closure A a.2⟩ = f a expresses that g1 agrees with f on A when we include A into its closure using the canonical inclusion A → closure A (subset_closure A a.2 provides the proof that a ∈ closure A). Likewise, h2 says the same for g2.
- Conclusion: g1 = g2. This asserts uniqueness: any two continuous extensions of f to closure A that agree with f on A are equal.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Given A ⊆ X, f: A → Y continuous, Y Hausdorff. If f can be extended to a continuous g: \bar{A} → Y, then g is uniquely determined by f. This is usually formalized as: if g1 and g2 are continuous on \bar{A} and agree with f on A, then g1 = g2.
- The Lean theorem exactly states that: for any two continuous g1, g2 on closure A that extend f on A, one has g1 = g2.
- The use of Subtype (closure A) correctly models the space \bar{A} with the subspace topology.
- The inclusion condition via subset_closure is the standard way to express the restriction agreement.
- The presence of hf : Continuous f is consistent with the hypothesis in the natural language statement (even though uniqueness does not strictly require it, including it does not harm faithfulness).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts come from Mathlib.

Final check:
- Both problems assert uniqueness of the continuous extension of f from A to its closure in a Hausdorff codomain. The Lean code precisely captures this as an equality of any two such extensions. There are no mismatches in domains, topologies, or properties. The slight redundancy of assuming f is continuous is consistent with the original statement and does not change the meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Context: `{X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]` means X is a topological space that is compact and Hausdorff (T2).
- `(X1 X2 : Set X)` introduces two subsets X1 and X2 of X.
- `(hX1 : IsClosed (X1 : Set X)) (hX2 : IsClosed (X2 : Set X))` asserts that X1 and X2 are closed in X.
- `(hcover : X1 ∪ X2 = (Set.univ : Set X))` states that X is the union of X1 and X2 (since `Set.univ` is all of X).
- `(hmet1 : MetrizableSpace (Subtype X1)) (hmet2 : MetrizableSpace (Subtype X2))` asserts that the subspace topologies on X1 and X2 are metrizable. In Lean, `(Subtype X1)` denotes the subspace of X consisting of points in X1, with the induced topology.
- Conclusion: `MetrizableSpace X` i.e., X is metrizable.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement: “Let X be a compact Hausdorff space that is the union of the closed subspaces X1 and X2. If X1 and X2 are metrizable, show that X is metrizable.”
- Compact Hausdorff: matched by `[CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]`.
- Union of closed subspaces: matched by `IsClosed X1`, `IsClosed X2`, and `X1 ∪ X2 = univ`.
- X1 and X2 metrizable as subspaces: matched by `MetrizableSpace (Subtype X1)` and `MetrizableSpace (Subtype X2)`.
- Conclusion that X is metrizable: matched by `MetrizableSpace X`.
No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it’s a straight theorem statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
There are no substantive differences. The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement using standard Mathlib notions. The use of `Subtype` correctly models the subspace topology. Everything aligns.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: it asserts that normality of the product implies normality of each factor, with the explicit assumption that each factor is nonempty.
- `NormalSpace` is the standard Mathlib typeclass for normal topological spaces. `(∀ i, X i)` is the dependent product Π i, X i with the product topology coming from the given `TopologicalSpace` instances. The nonemptiness assumption `[∀ i, Nonempty (X i)]` matches the stated assumption.

  - `↑(Real.sqrt 3)` is the real square root of 3 coerced into ℂ, i.e., sqrt(3) ∈ ℝ seen as a complex.
  - `I` is the imaginary unit i.
  - So the base is exactly (−1 + sqrt(3) i)/2, and it is raised to the third power, equated to 1 ∈ ℂ.

The natural language asks to show that (−1 + √3 i)/2 is a cube root of 1, explicitly meaning its cube equals 1. The Lean statement asserts precisely that the cube of ((−1 + √3 i)/2) equals 1 in ℂ. This is an exact match.

- `(hn : ∀ i, Nonempty (X i))` assumes each factor X i is nonempty.
- `(i : ι) : T2Space (X i)` states that for an arbitrary index i, the space X i is Hausdorff.
- `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this doesn’t affect whether the statement faithfully translates the natural language.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language: “Show that if ∏ X_α is Hausdorff, then so is X_α. Assume that each X_α is nonempty.”
- The Lean theorem exactly asserts: if the product Π i, X i is T2 (Hausdorff) and each X i is nonempty, then for each i, X i is T2. This is the same content as the natural language statement; the parameter `i : ι` corresponds to “each factor.”

3) Final check:
- The assumptions match: product Hausdorff and all factors nonempty.
- The conclusion matches: each factor is Hausdorff.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib classes (`TopologicalSpace`, `T2Space`, `Nonempty`) are used.
- Slight formalization detail: expressing “each X_α is Hausdorff” as a function returning `T2Space (X i)` for arbitrary `i` is standard and equivalent to the universal quantification.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language problem.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G] [TopologicalSpace G] [TopologicalGroup G]` sets up a type G with a group structure and a compatible topology (a topological group).
- The comment matches the natural language prompt.
- `def Munkres_exercise_25_9 : Prop := ...` defines a proposition stating properties about a set C.
- `let C : Set G := connected_component (1 : G)` introduces C as the connected component of the identity element 1 in G (i.e., e in the statement). This matches the natural-language “component of G containing e.”
- The proposition is the conjunction of three properties:
  1) `∀ x y, x ∈ C → y ∈ C → x * y ∈ C` (closure under multiplication),
  2) `∀ x, x ∈ C → x⁻¹ ∈ C` (closure under inversion),
  3) `∀ g h, h ∈ C → g * h * g ⁻¹ ∈ C` (closure under conjugation by arbitrary g ∈ G),
  which together express that C is a normal subgroup (since 1 ∈ C by definition of C as the component of 1, the subgroup axioms are satisfied). 

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- The natural language statement asks to show that the connected component of the identity in a topological group is a normal subgroup. The Lean proposition asserts precisely the closure under multiplication, inverse, and conjugation, which, together with the fact that 1 ∈ C (implicit from the definition of C), is equivalent to “C is a normal subgroup of G.”

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code does not explicitly restate that 1 ∈ C, but this is inherent from defining C as the connected component of 1. Hence, the subgroup nonemptiness/identity axiom is covered implicitly.
- The code frames the result as a conjunction of closure properties rather than as a `Subgroup`/`Normal` structure, but this is a standard equivalent formulation and faithfully captures “C is a normal subgroup.”
- No vacuous placeholders are introduced; the only auxiliary notion is the connected component, a standard Mathlib concept (minor naming detail aside, but per instructions we treat the code as compiling). 

Conclusion: The formal statement is an essentially faithful translation of the natural language theorem. Minor stylistic/packaging differences exist, but no substantive mathematical discrepancy.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The lemma `regular_iff_pairwise_disjoint_closed_nhd_tac_4791 [TopologicalSpace X] : RegularSpace X → ∀ (x y : X), x ≠ y → ∃ U V, IsClosed U ∧ IsClosed V ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V ∧ U ∩ V = ∅` states: For a topological space X, if X is regular, then for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist sets U and V such that U and V are closed, x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that if X is regular, every pair of points of X have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint.""
- This means: For any two (implicitly distinct) points x, y, there exist neighborhoods N_x of x and N_y of y (typically open sets) such that closure(N_x) and closure(N_y) are disjoint.

3) Differences:
- The Lean statement asserts existence of disjoint closed sets containing x and y. It does not require these sets to be neighborhoods (no openness or neighborhood condition), nor does it mention closures of neighborhoods.
- The natural language statement specifically requires neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint. In particular, it quantifies over neighborhoods (often open sets), and the disjointness is of their closures, not necessarily the sets themselves.
- While the NL statement would imply the Lean conclusion by taking closed sets to be the closures of the neighborhoods, the Lean statement is strictly weaker and does not capture the requirement that they are neighborhoods with disjoint closures.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It omits both the ""neighborhood"" condition and the ""closures are disjoint"" condition, replacing them with ""closed sets are disjoint"" and merely containing the points. Hence the two statements are different.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem countable_prod_of_countable_dense {ι : Type*} [Countable ι] {X : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)] ...`:
  We have a countable index type ι, and for each i in ι a topological space X i. The product space is the Pi type (∀ i, X i) with the product topology (provided by Mathlib's instance).
- `(D : ∀ i, Set (X i)) (hD_countable : ∀ i, (D i).Countable) (hD_dense : ∀ i, Dense (D i))`:
  For each i we are given a subset D i of X i that is countable and dense in X i.
- Conclusion: `∃ S : Set (∀ i, X i), S.Countable ∧ Dense S`:
  There exists a subset S of the product space that is countable and dense (in the product topology).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: if X is a countable product of spaces each having a countable dense subset, then X has a countable dense subset. The Lean statement assumes a countable index set ι, a family of topological spaces X i, and for each i a countable dense subset D i; then asserts the existence of a countable dense subset S in the product Π i, X i. This matches the intended theorem exactly.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean version covers the general dependent product (possibly varying X i), which is a standard and slightly more general formulation of a product of spaces; this is acceptable.
- The Lean statement takes the countable dense subsets D i as explicit parameters, whereas the natural language says “spaces having countable dense subsets” (an existence claim). This is a standard way to state such results; given existence, one can choose such D i and apply the theorem. No loss of faithfulness.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib’s standard notions `Countable`, `Dense`, and the product topology on Pi types.

Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
- The natural language statement is: ""Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular."" In Mathlib terminology: ""Hausdorff"" is `T2Space`, ""locally compact"" is `LocallyCompactSpace`, and ""completely regular"" is `CompletelyRegularSpace`. The theorem exactly matches this claim as a universally quantified statement over all X.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; no placeholders for concepts are made. The code directly uses standard Mathlib typeclasses. There is no scope mismatch or extra/ missing hypotheses. The slight generality of using `Type*` is standard and appropriate. Thus the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks for an example of a nonempty subset U of ℝ^2 that is closed under scalar multiplication but is not a subspace of ℝ^2. The formal statement asserts the existence of such a set U, explicitly giving nonemptiness, closure under scalar multiplication, and failure of closure under addition. Failure of closure under addition is sufficient to conclude U is not a subspace. Thus, the Lean statement matches the intended mathematical content.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: ℝ^2 is represented as ℝ × ℝ — correct.
- Properties: nonempty and closed under scalar multiplication are included; “not a subspace” is captured by witnessing failure of additivity, which is a necessary subspace axiom. This is a standard and faithful way to encode “not a subspace.”

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def I : Set ℝ := Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1` defines the closed unit interval [0,1] as a subset of ℝ.
- `def X : Type := { f : ℕ → ℝ // ∀ n, f n ∈ I }` defines X as the subtype of all sequences f : ℕ → ℝ such that each coordinate lies in [0,1]. So X is [0,1]^ℕ as a subtype of ℕ → ℝ.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_29_4 : ¬ LocallyCompactSpace X := by sorry` states that X is not a locally compact space (with whatever TopologicalSpace instance Lean infers on X). No topology/metric/uniform structure is explicitly provided; the proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: “[0,1]^ω is not locally compact in the uniform topology.” This explicitly refers to the uniform topology coming from the sup metric (uniform convergence) on sequences valued in [0,1].
- In the Lean code, X is a subtype of (ℕ → ℝ). The TopologicalSpace instance that Lean will use by default on X is the subtype topology induced from (ℕ → ℝ) with its product (Pi) topology coming from the usual topology on ℝ. This is the topology of pointwise convergence, not the uniform topology (sup metric). The comment mentions the uniform topology, but no metric or uniform structure is defined or used to induce that topology on X.
- Therefore, the theorem as stated in Lean asserts ¬ LocallyCompactSpace X for X with the product/subtype topology, not the uniform topology. This is not faithful to the intended statement.

3) Final check (are the problems the same?):
- No. The Lean code addresses X with the default product topology, while the statement is about the uniform (sup) topology. Moreover, with the product topology [0,1]^ℕ is compact by Tychonoff and hence locally compact; so the Lean theorem’s claim would actually be false for the topology it implicitly uses. The code contains no auxiliary bogus definitions, but it fails to encode the crucial uniform/sup topology structure.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the missing and incorrect topology; the core mathematical content differs.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens: Just setup; not mathematically substantive.
- The theorem statement:
  theorem not_tendstoUniformlyOn_pow_extracted (n : ℕ) : ¬ TendstoUniformlyOn (fun x => x ^ n) (fun x => x) atTop (Icc 0 1)
  Natural language: For a fixed natural number n, consider the constant family of functions F_a(x) = x^n (independent of the index a). The statement asserts that this constant family does not converge uniformly on [0,1] to the identity function g(x) = x as the index goes to infinity (atTop).

Assessment of whether this matches the original statement:
- The original problem: Define f_n(x) = x^n on [0,1]. Show that the sequence (f_n) does not converge uniformly on [0,1]. This is about the sequence indexed by n (i.e., the family F n x = x^n) and its uniform convergence behavior as n → ∞. The usual intended meaning is “does not converge uniformly to its pointwise limit,” which is f(x) = 0 for x in [0,1) and f(1) = 1.
- The Lean statement instead:
  1) Introduces a fixed parameter n and then talks about TendstoUniformlyOn for the function (fun x => x^n), which is constant in the (hidden) index of the filter atTop. This is the wrong shape: it should be a family F : ℕ → (domain → codomain), i.e., F n x = x^n, with atTop on ℕ.
  2) Targets the identity function g(x) = x, which is not the pointwise limit of x^n on [0,1]. The pointwise limit is the function that is 0 on [0,1) and 1 at x=1.
  3) Because the first argument is not a family in the filter index, the statement is about a constant family in a and says it does not converge uniformly to x. This is unrelated to the intended uniform non-convergence of the sequence (f_n) as n → ∞ to its pointwise limit.
  4) Moreover, for n = 1, the Lean statement is false: the constant family F_a(x) = x does converge uniformly to g(x) = x (trivially, it’s equal). Thus the Lean theorem (as a universal statement over n) is not even true, showing further mismatch.

Final comparison:
- The code does not formalize “the sequence (f_n) with f_n(x) = x^n does not converge uniformly on [0,1].” It instead claims a different, incorrect uniform non-convergence statement about a constant-in-index family to the identity function, and with the wrong target function and wrong indexing. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: ""The union of two subspaces of V is a subspace of V iff one of the subspaces is contained in the other."" In Lean, ""is a submodule"" is naturally encoded by the existence of a submodule S whose carrier set equals the given union, exactly as written on the left side.
- The right side `(U ≤ W) ∨ (W ≤ U)` expresses ""one is contained in the other.""
- The context uses Submodule over a field K, i.e., vector subspaces. This is a standard and faithful formalization (even a slight generalization to modules would also be fine, but here they assume a field, matching ""subspace"").

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid V] [Module R V]`: We work over a general module V over a semiring R (so this is a generalization of vector spaces over a field).
- `theorem Axler_exercise_5_1 {m : ℕ} (T : V →ₗ[R] V) (U : Fin m → Submodule R V)`: Let m be a natural number, T a linear map from V to V, and U a family of submodules indexed by i ∈ Fin m (i.e., U₀, …, U_{m-1}).
- Hypothesis `(h : ∀ i : Fin m, (U i).map T ≤ U i)`: For each i, the image of U i under T is contained in U i; equivalently, each U i is invariant under T.
- Conclusion: `(Submodule.sum (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin m)) U).map T ≤ Submodule.sum (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin m)) U`: The image under T of the sum of all the U i (indexed by all i in Fin m) is contained in that sum; i.e., the sum is invariant under T.

2) Whole translation vs. the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If T ∈ L(V) and U₁, …, Uₘ are T-invariant subspaces, then U₁ + ⋯ + Uₘ is T-invariant.
- Lean: Exactly expresses that for a finite family of submodules U i invariant under T, their finite sum is invariant under T. The use of `map T ≤` is the standard formalization of invariance. The sum is expressed by `Submodule.sum (Finset.univ) U`.

3) Final check of equivalence and any differences:
- The Lean version works over a general semiring/module rather than a field/vector space; this is a harmless generalization and faithful to the statement's intent.
- The subspaces are indexed by `Fin m` instead of being named U₁,…,Uₘ; this is equivalent.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- Conclusion matches exactly: T(U₁ + ⋯ + Uₘ) ⊆ U₁ + ⋯ + Uₘ.

Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the given statement (indeed slightly more general).

- The Lean theorem asserts that for each λ, λ is an eigenvalue of ST iff it is an eigenvalue of TS, i.e., the sets of eigenvalues are equal. This matches the statement exactly (as a set equality, not talking about multiplicities).

Step 3: Final check and potential discrepancies.
- The code assumes V is finite-dimensional. The natural statement did not explicitly say finite-dimensional, but in the usual context (and specifically Axler’s exercises), V is finite-dimensional. Moreover, the equivalence for all λ, including λ = 0, generally needs finite dimensionality (or some invertibility equivalence) to be universally true; thus the assumption is appropriate and not a red flag.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the statement is precise and uses standard Mathlib structures.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

# Exercise (Munkres 28.6) — isometries of compact metric spaces

Let (X, d) be a metric space. A map f : X → X with

  dist (f x) (f y) = dist x y

for all x, y ∈ X is called an isometry. Show that if f is an isometry and X is
compact, then f is bijective and hence a homeomorphism.

We state the standard lemmas below. Proofs are omitted (:= by sorry).

variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]

/-- An isometry of a metric space X (into itself). -/
def isometry (f : X → X) : Prop := ∀ x y, dist (f x) (f y) = dist x y

/-- An isometry is injective. -/

/-- Combining the two previous facts, an isometry of a compact metric space is

theorem isometry.bijective_and_continuous_of_compact {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) [CompactSpace X] : Function.Bijective f ∧ Continuous f := by sorry

/- Notes:
  * The injectivity proof is immediate from dist (f x) (f y) = dist x y.
  * The surjectivity uses compactness to rule out a proper isometric embedding
    of X into itself (one standard proof produces an infinite r-separated
    sequence contradicting total boundedness).
  * Since metric spaces are Hausdorff, a continuous bijection from a compact
    space to a Hausdorff space has continuous inverse, hence is a homeomorphism.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]`: We work with a type X equipped with a metric space structure.
- `def isometry (f : X → X) : Prop := ∀ x y, dist (f x) (f y) = dist x y`: An isometry on X is a function f : X → X that preserves distances for all pairs x, y.
- `theorem isometry.injective {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) : Function.Injective f := by sorry`: Any isometry (as defined above) is injective.
- `theorem isometry.surjective_of_compact {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) [CompactSpace X] : Function.Surjective f := by sorry`: If X is compact and f is an isometry X → X, then f is surjective.
- `theorem isometry.bijective_and_continuous_of_compact {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) [CompactSpace X] : Function.Bijective f ∧ Continuous f := by sorry`: If X is compact and f is an isometry, then f is bijective and continuous.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines isometry exactly as distance preservation for all pairs, which matches the `def isometry`.
- It asks to show: if f is an isometry and X is compact, then f is bijective and hence a homeomorphism. The code states injectivity, surjectivity (under compactness), and concludes bijectivity plus continuity. This strongly aligns with the first part (bijectivity) and also adds continuity (which follows from being an isometry). However, it does not explicitly state that f is a homeomorphism (e.g., via `Homeomorph` or continuity of the inverse). The docstring explains that a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism, and since metric spaces are Hausdorff this applies, but the Lean statement itself stops short of asserting a homeomorphism.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Matching parts: definition of isometry, injectivity, surjectivity under compactness, and thus bijectivity. Continuity is also included, which is compatible and expected.
- Difference: The natural language explicitly concludes “hence a homeomorphism,” while the Lean code’s final theorem only concludes “bijective and continuous,” not the homeomorphism statement (no explicit `Homeomorph` or continuous inverse). Given metric spaces are Hausdorff and X is compact, the homeomorphism conclusion is a standard corollary, but it is not formalized in the statement.
- Use of Mathlib terms: The code defines its own `isometry` predicate rather than using Mathlib’s `Isometry f`. This is acceptable because the definition is faithful and not vacuous, though it misses reuse of existing library lemmas.

Overall, the translation is very close and essentially covers the main mathematical content up to the threshold that allows concluding homeomorphism, but it omits the explicit homeomorphism conclusion in Lean.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators`: Bring in Mathlib and notation for big sums.
- The theorem `ireland_rosen_exercise_1_30 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : ¬ ∃ m : ℤ, (∑ k in Finset.Ico 2 (n+1), (1 : ℚ) / k) = (m : ℚ)` states: For a natural number n with n ≥ 2, there does not exist an integer m such that the sum over k in Finset.Ico 2 (n+1) of 1/k (as rationals) equals m (viewed as a rational). Here `Finset.Ico 2 (n+1)` is the finite set {k ∈ ℕ | 2 ≤ k < n+1}, i.e., k = 2, 3, ..., n. Thus the sum is exactly 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n in ℚ. The claim is that this sum is never an integer.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: “Prove that 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n is not an integer.” The Lean statement asserts, for n ≥ 2, there is no integer m such that the rational sum equals m. This is precisely the formal version of “is not an integer.” The index set exactly matches terms 2 through n. The codomain being ℚ is appropriate, and the comparison is made with integers embedded into ℚ, which is standard.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Range of n: The NL statement implicitly assumes n ≥ 2 (otherwise the sum might be empty or ill-defined). The Lean statement explicitly requires 2 ≤ n, which aligns with standard formulations.
- Domain/codomain: Lean uses rationals ℚ and checks equality to an integer cast to ℚ; this matches the intended meaning of “not an integer.”
- Indexing: `Finset.Ico 2 (n+1)` gives terms 2..n inclusive, matching the NL sum 1/2 + ... + 1/n.
No discrepancies found. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for types X and Y equipped with MetricSpace structures, and Y additionally has a CompleteSpace structure. This matches “(X, d_X), (Y, d_Y) metric spaces; Y complete.”
- A : Set X represents the subset A ⊂ X.
- f : Subtype A → Y means f is a function defined on A (viewed as a subtype of X) into Y.
- hf : UniformContinuous f is the hypothesis that f is uniformly continuous.
- The conclusion: ∃! (g : Subtype (closure A) → Y), Continuous g ∧ UniformContinuous g ∧ ∀ a : Subtype A, g ⟨a.1, subset_closure a.2⟩ = f a.
  - There exists a unique function g defined on closure A (as a subtype) into Y such that g is both continuous and uniformly continuous, and g agrees with f on A. The term ⟨a.1, subset_closure a.2⟩ is the coercion of a point a ∈ A into a point of closure A using that A ⊆ closure A.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If f : A → Y is uniformly continuous and Y is complete, then f extends uniquely to a continuous function g : closure A → Y, and g is uniformly continuous.
- The code asserts existence and uniqueness of an extension g that is both continuous and uniformly continuous, and that agrees with f on A. This captures existence of a continuous uniformly continuous extension and the agreement property correctly.
- However, the uniqueness is stated among the class of functions that are both continuous and uniformly continuous. The natural statement asserts uniqueness among continuous extensions (and then adds that the unique extension is uniformly continuous). The code’s uniqueness condition is slightly weaker: it does not exclude the hypothetical existence of another continuous extension that is not uniformly continuous. In reality, such a function cannot exist, but the formal statement does not preclude it on its face.

3) Final comparison:
- All structural components (metric spaces, completeness of Y, domain A, extension to closure A, uniform continuity of f and of the extension, agreement on A) are present and correct.
- The only discrepancy is the scope of the uniqueness: the Lean code states uniqueness within the subclass of continuous and uniformly continuous functions, whereas the natural statement asserts uniqueness among continuous extensions. This is a minor weakening of the uniqueness claim in the formalization; otherwise, the translation is faithful.

Given this small but real mismatch, this is an almost perfect translation but not strictly exact.

- `variable {V : Type*} [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 V]`: V is an inner product space over 𝕜.

  Natural language: Fix a natural number m and an m-tuple of vectors e₁,…,e_m in V (encoded as a function e : Fin m → V), assume the family is orthonormal (he : Orthonormal 𝕜 e). For any v ∈ V, we have the equivalence: the squared norm of v equals the sum over i of the squared absolute values of the inner products ⟪v, e_i⟫ if and only if v lies in the linear span over 𝕜 of the set {e_i | i ∈ Fin m}. Here `‖⟪v, e i⟫‖` is the modulus in 𝕜 (absolute value), and `Submodule.span 𝕜 (Set.range e)` is the span of {e₁,…,e_m}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For an orthonormal list (e₁,…,e_m) in V and v ∈ V, prove that ‖v‖² = |⟨v, e₁⟩|² + … + |⟨v, e_m⟩|² if and only if v ∈ span(e₁,…,e_m).
- The Lean version uses an orthonormal family indexed by Fin m, which is the standard formalization of an orthonormal list; `Set.range e` captures the set {e₁,…,e_m}, and its linear span matches span(e₁,…,e_m). The equality is exactly the same (norm squared equals sum of squared moduli of inner products). The iff is explicit as `↔`.
- Working over 𝕜 = ℝ or ℂ matches the typical context for inner product spaces and absolute values. Using an inner product space structure on V is exactly what's needed.

3) Final check for differences:
- List vs function `Fin m → V`: equivalent formalizations; orthonormality prevents duplicates, so using set range loses no information.
- Sum over Fin m vs explicit finite sum: equivalent.
- Absolute values and squares, and norm squared are directly mirrored.
- No extraneous or missing hypotheses. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions.

Conclusion: The theorem statement in Lean is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `{V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module ℝ V] [FiniteDimensional ℝ V]` means V is a finite-dimensional real vector space.
- `T : V →ₗ[ℝ] V` is a real-linear operator on V.
- `h_no_eig : ∀ λ : ℝ, (T - λ • LinearMap.id).ker = ⊥` expresses that for every real λ, the kernel of T − λ·id is trivial. This is exactly the statement that T has no real eigenvalues.
- Goal: `∀ W : Submodule ℝ V, Submodule.map T W ≤ W → ∃ k : ℕ, finrank ℝ W = 2 * k`.
  • Here `W : Submodule ℝ V` is a subspace of V.
  • `Submodule.map T W ≤ W` says T(W) ⊆ W, i.e., W is invariant under T.
  • `∃ k : ℕ, finrank ℝ W = 2 * k` asserts that the (finite) dimension of W is even.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Suppose V is a real vector space and T ∈ L(V) has no eigenvalues. Prove that every subspace of V invariant under T has even dimension.”
- Lean code: Assumes V is a finite-dimensional real vector space, T is linear, T has no real eigenvalues, and proves any T-invariant subspace has even dimension.
- The condition “no eigenvalues” over a real vector space is captured by `∀ λ, ker(T − λ id) = ⊥`. The invariance condition is correctly formalized by `Submodule.map T W ≤ W`. Evenness of dimension is expressed as `finrank ℝ W = 2 * k` for some `k : ℕ`.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The only difference is that the Lean code explicitly assumes `FiniteDimensional ℝ V`. The natural language statement does not say this explicitly, but “even dimension” is only meaningful for finite-dimensional subspaces. In the typical context of Axler’s exercise, finite-dimensionality is intended. Moreover, since V is finite-dimensional, every subspace W is automatically finite-dimensional, making `finrank` applicable.
- Aside from this standard and reasonable specialization, the code is a faithful formalization of the statement: same objects, same hypotheses (no real eigenvalues), same conclusion (every T-invariant subspace has even dimension).

Conclusion: The translation is faithful; no vacuous or placeholder definitions; uses standard Mathlib notions; the slight specialization to finite-dimensional spaces aligns with the intended meaning of “even dimension.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {K : Type _} [Field K]`: We work over a field K.
- `variable {V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] [FiniteDimensional K V]`: V is a finite-dimensional K-vector space.
- The theorem `Axler_exercise_5_13 (T : V →ₗ[K] V) ... : ∃ c : K, T = c • LinearMap.id` states: Let T be a K-linear endomorphism of V. Assume `h`: for every submodule W of V, if `finrank K W = finrank K V - 1`, then for all `w ∈ W`, `T w ∈ W`. This means every subspace W of V of (finite) dimension one less than the dimension of V is invariant under T. The conclusion is that there exists a scalar `c : K` such that `T` equals `c` times the identity map on V.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: “Suppose T ∈ L(V) is such that every subspace of V with dimension dim V − 1 is invariant under T. Prove T is a scalar multiple of the identity.”
- Lean statement exactly mirrors this: T is a linear operator on V; every subspace W with `finrank W = finrank V - 1` is T-invariant; conclude `∃ c, T = c • id`.
- The use of `finrank` captures dimension; invariance is expressed as `∀ w ∈ W, T w ∈ W`.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- The only nuance is that Lean uses natural-number subtraction for `finrank K V - 1`, which is truncated. If `finrank V = 0`, then `finrank V - 1 = 0`, so the hypothesis applies to 0-dimensional subspaces (just `{0}`), whereas the natural language “dim V − 1” would be −1 and there would be no such subspaces. This is a very slight strengthening of the hypothesis in the zero-dimensional case, but it does not change the meaning substantively, and the conclusion still matches the intended statement. For positive dimensions, it is exactly the same.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib objects. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators Real Nat` set up the environment with sums and real numbers.
- The docstring explains the goal and clarifies that the index `j` runs over `Fin n` (i.e., 0,1,...,n-1) and the weight corresponding to the natural-language index 1..n is implemented as `j.val + 1`. The code writes `(j + 1)`, which is interpreted as the natural number `(j : ℕ) + 1` and then coerced to `ℝ` in the real expressions.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Axler_exercise_6_3 {n : ℕ} (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : (∑ j, a j * b j) ^ 2 ≤ (∑ j, (j + 1) * a j ^ 2) * (∑ j, b j ^ 2 / (j + 1)) := by sorry`.
  • Here, `a` and `b` are sequences of length `n`, modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`, corresponding to `(a_1,...,a_n)` and `(b_1,...,b_n)`.
  • The sum `∑ j` is over `j : Fin n`, i.e., indices 0..n-1. The term `(j + 1)` serves as the weight corresponding to the natural-language index `j = 1..n`.
  • The left-hand side `(∑ j, a j * b j) ^ 2` matches `(∑_{j=1}^n a_j b_j)^2` under the identification of `Fin n` with `{1,...,n}` via `j ↦ j+1`.
  • The right-hand side `(∑ j, (j + 1) * a j ^ 2) * (∑ j, b j ^ 2 / (j + 1))` corresponds exactly to `(∑_{j=1}^n j a_j^2) (∑_{j=1}^n b_j^2 / j)` when reindexing.

Faithfulness check against the natural-language statement:
- The mathematical content is the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality with weights `j`, precisely as in the natural statement.
- Indexing: The Lean code uses `Fin n` with weights `(j+1)` to represent indices `1..n`. This is a standard and faithful way to model sums from 1 to n in Lean.
- Quantification: The code universally quantifies over `n : ℕ` and sequences `a, b : Fin n → ℝ`, matching “for all real numbers a_1,...,a_n and b_1,...,b_n”. Allowing `n = 0` is a harmless slight generalization; the inequality still holds.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given (with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Final comparison: The Lean theorem statement is mathematically equivalent to the natural-language inequality, with the only difference being the standard reindexing via `Fin n` and weights `(j+1)`. There are no mismatches in the expressions or quantifiers.

Thus, this is a natural and acceptable specialization that makes the statement correct and matches the intended exercise.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly matches the mathematical claim.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the intended (finite-dimensional) statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_4_11 (p k : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) : ...` states a theorem for natural numbers p and k with the assumption that p is prime.
- The conclusion is an if-then-else statement depending on whether (p - 1) ∣ k:
  - If (p - 1) ∣ k, then `∑ a in (Finset.range p).erase 0, ((a : ZMod p) ^ k) = (-1 : ZMod p)`. This says the sum over a = 1, ..., p-1 (implemented as range p with 0 erased) of a^k, computed in ZMod p, equals −1 in ZMod p.
  - Else (i.e., (p - 1) ∤ k), the same sum equals 0 in ZMod p.
- The index set `(Finset.range p).erase 0` is precisely {1, 2, ..., p-1}. Casting `a : ZMod p` and then taking `^ k` computes the k-th power modulo p. Equality in ZMod p corresponds to congruence modulo p.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For prime p, the sum 1^k + 2^k + ... + (p−1)^k is congruent to 0 mod p if (p−1) does not divide k, and congruent to −1 mod p if (p−1) divides k.
- The Lean statement expresses exactly the same via equality in ZMod p, splitting into the two cases using an if-then-else. Using ZMod p is the standard way to express congruences in Lean.
- The sum is over the same set {1, ..., p−1}, and powers are taken modulo p in the expected way. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement (with proof omitted), so no red flags.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The Lean code states precisely the modular congruence as an equality in ZMod p, with the same case distinction based on (p−1) ∣ k. The indexing matches 1..p−1, and the interpretation of −1 and 0 is in ZMod p, which matches mod p congruences. No discrepancies found.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work with complex matrices A : Matrix n n ℂ, where n is a finite type (Fintype n) with decidable equality. This models a finite-dimensional complex inner-product space (ℂ^n with the standard inner product).
- Normality assumption: h_normal : A * A.conjTranspose = A.conjTranspose * A. This is exactly the definition of a normal operator (AA† = A†A).
- Self-adjointness (Hermitian): A = A.conjTranspose.
- Eigenvalues real: The right-hand side states ∀ μ : ℂ, (∃ v : n → ℂ, v ≠ 0 ∧ A.mulVec v = μ • v) → μ.im = 0. This says for any complex number μ, if there exists a nonzero vector v with Av = μ v (i.e., μ is an eigenvalue), then the imaginary part of μ is zero. Equivalently, all eigenvalues are real.
- The theorem states an iff: under the normality assumption, A is self-adjoint if and only if all its eigenvalues are real.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that a normal operator on a complex inner-product space is self-adjoint if and only if all its eigenvalues are real."" The Lean theorem exactly formalizes this equivalence for normal complex matrices (operators on ℂ^n), which is the standard finite-dimensional model of complex inner-product spaces.
- The code’s expression of “all eigenvalues are real” via μ.im = 0 for any μ admitting a nonzero eigenvector is faithful.
- The normality assumption is explicitly included, matching the statement. Note: the direction ""self-adjoint ⇒ eigenvalues real"" does not need normality, but including normality as a standing assumption is harmless and consistent with the phrasing “a normal operator … is self-adjoint iff …”.

Potential differences:
- Specialization to finite-dimensional matrices on ℂ^n rather than an arbitrary complex inner-product space. This is a standard and faithful specialization; the theorem is basis-invariant and typically stated in finite-dimensional settings. The problem statement likely intends the finite-dimensional case (as in Axler 7.9 mentioned in the comment). This is an acceptable slight specialization per the guidelines.
- Use of μ.im = 0 rather than μ ∈ ℝ is equivalent over ℂ.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is stated directly (proof omitted via sorry, which is allowed per instructions).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement (with the conventional finite-dimensional/matrix model).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_2_4 (a : Int) (ha : a ≠ 0) : ∀ {n m : Nat}, n > m → Int.gcd (a ^ (2 ^ n) + 1) (a ^ (2 ^ m) + 1) = (if a % 2 = 0 then 2 else 1) := by sorry`
  This states: For any integer a with a ≠ 0, for all natural numbers n, m with n > m, the greatest common divisor of a^(2^n) + 1 and a^(2^m) + 1 equals 2 if a is even (expressed as a % 2 = 0) and equals 1 if a is odd.
  There are no auxiliary definitions; it directly states the theorem. It uses Int.gcd on integer arguments, exponentiation with natural exponents, and checks parity via `a % 2 = 0`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language: ""If a is a nonzero integer, then for n > m show that gcd(a^{2^n}+1, a^{2^m}+1) = 1 or 2 depending on whether a is odd or even."" The Lean code indeed asserts the gcd is either 1 or 2 depending only on the parity of a, uniformly for all n > m.
- However, the code makes a specific choice: it asserts the value is 2 when a is even and 1 when a is odd. The standard and intended mapping in this well-known result is the opposite: if a is odd then both numbers are even, so the gcd is 2; if a is even then both numbers are odd, so the gcd is 1. For example, a = 2, n = 1, m = 0 gives gcd(2^2+1, 2^1+1) = gcd(5, 3) = 1, but the code’s RHS would be 2 because 2 is even.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Both quantify over a ≠ 0 integer and all n, m with n > m, and both claim the gcd is 1 or 2 depending on parity. But the Lean code pins down the dependence incorrectly: it states even → 2 and odd → 1, which is reversed from the intended statement. Therefore, the translation is not faithful to the mathematical meaning, even though the overall structure and quantifiers match and there are no vacuous placeholders.

Given this discrepancy, the code is close in structure but gets the crucial parity mapping wrong.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library.
- The docstring states: For an odd prime p, x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution for p ≡ 1 (mod 4) iff p = A^2 + 64 B^2 for some A, B in Z. This matches the intended exercise statement.
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_5_28 {p : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hmod4 : p % 4 = 1) : (∃ x : ZMod p, x ^ 4 = (2 : ZMod p)) ↔ ∃ A B : ℤ, (p : ℤ) = A ^ 2 + 64 * B ^ 2 := by sorry`
  - `p : ℕ`, with `hp : Nat.Prime p`: p is a natural number and prime. In particular, with `p % 4 = 1`, this implies p is odd, matching the usual context of the statement.
  - `hmod4 : p % 4 = 1`: p ≡ 1 (mod 4).
  - Left side `(∃ x : ZMod p, x ^ 4 = (2 : ZMod p))`: There exists x modulo p such that x^4 ≡ 2 mod p. Using ZMod p is the standard formalization of congruences modulo p.
  - Right side `∃ A B : ℤ, (p : ℤ) = A ^ 2 + 64 * B ^ 2`: p can be written as A^2 + 64 B^2 for some integers A, B.
  - The ↔ exactly encodes the “iff”.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Show that x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution for p ≡ 1 (mod 4) iff p is of the form A^2 + 64 B^2.”
- The Lean statement assumes p is prime (and with p ≡ 1 mod 4, it is necessarily odd), which is the standard and intended context for such a representation result. The original sentence did not explicitly say “prime”, but this is typically implicit, and without primeness the statement would not be correct as stated. The docstring explicitly says “Let p be an odd prime,” matching the standard formulation. Thus the code’s hypotheses are appropriate and faithful.
- The left side (existence of a solution to x^4 ≡ 2 mod p) matches via ZMod p. The right side matches the representation of p as A^2 + 64 B^2 over integers.
- No auxiliary bogus definitions are introduced; there is just a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions.

Final check:
- The mathematical content in Lean precisely matches the intended theorem: For a prime p with p ≡ 1 (mod 4), solvability of x^4 ≡ 2 mod p is equivalent to p = A^2 + 64 B^2. No discrepancies in quantifiers, domains, or conditions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `variable {𝕜 : Type*} [IsROrC 𝕜]`: We work over a scalar field 𝕜 which is either ℝ or ℂ.
- `variable {V : Type*} [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 V] [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 V]`: V is a finite-dimensional inner product space over 𝕜.
- The theorem statement: Given `h : 2 ≤ finrank 𝕜 V` (i.e., dim V ≥ 2 in the finite-dimensional sense), then `¬ ( { T : V →ₗ[𝕜] V | IsNormal T } : Set (V →ₗ[𝕜] V) ).IsSubmodule`. That is: the set of linear endomorphisms T on V that are normal (i.e., commute with their adjoint) is not a submodule (not a linear subspace) of the vector space of all endomorphisms V →ₗ[𝕜] V.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: If dim V ≥ 2, then the set of normal operators on V is not a subspace of L(V).
- The Lean statement matches exactly: it asserts that the subset `{T | IsNormal T}` of `End(V) = V →ₗ[𝕜] V` is not a submodule when `dim V ≥ 2`.
- The setup with `IsROrC` and `InnerProductSpace` is appropriate for the notion of normal operator (defined via the adjoint), and the use of `finrank` captures the dimension condition. This is a standard and acceptable formalization.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem uses Mathlib predicates directly.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same. The mathematical content and quantifiers align: under the hypothesis dim V ≥ 2, the set of normal operators is not closed under linear-combination (hence not a subspace). No extraneous or missing conditions; the small specialization to ℝ/ℂ and finite-dimensional (to express dim via finrank) is appropriate and faithful.

  This theorem asserts: For a natural number n with 2 ≤ n, n is not prime, and n ≠ 4, the image of (n−1)! in ZMod n equals 0. Equivalently, (n−1)! ≡ 0 (mod n) under these hypotheses. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""If n is not a prime, show that (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (n), except when n = 4.""
- The Lean theorem requires: n ≥ 2, n is not prime, and n ≠ 4, and concludes (n−1)! ≡ 0 (mod n). This matches the intended content. The added hypothesis `2 ≤ n` is a mild specialization to avoid edge cases (e.g., n = 0,1), and with `¬ Nat.Prime n` it effectively means “n is composite” in the usual context of the exercise. The exception n = 4 is explicitly excluded via `hn3 : n ≠ 4`.
- The codomain `ZMod n` and equality to 0 formalizes congruence modulo n appropriately.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only standard Mathlib notions are used. The presence of `sorry` does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

3) Final check of differences:
- The Lean code imposes `2 ≤ n`, which is a slight specialization compared to the English phrasing ""not prime"" (which also includes n = 1). This does not change the mathematical content for the intended range; in fact, the exercise is typically stated for composite n, and 2 ≤ n ∧ ¬Prime n captures that. The exception n = 4 is handled exactly.
- Otherwise, the statements coincide: both assert (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod n) for non-prime n, except for n = 4.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given statement (with a benign specialization `2 ≤ n`).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def squarefree (n : ℕ) : Prop := ¬ ∃ d : ℕ, 2 ≤ d ∧ d * d ∣ n` defines a natural number n to be squarefree if there does not exist an integer d ≥ 2 such that d^2 divides n. This is a standard and correct definition of squarefreeness.
- `theorem sum_over_squarefree_not_summable : ¬ Summable (fun n : ℕ => if n ≠ 0 ∧ squarefree n then (1 : ℝ) / (n : ℝ) else 0)` states that the series over ℕ of the sequence which equals 1/n when n ≥ 1 and n is squarefree, and 0 otherwise, is not summable in ℝ. Equivalently, the sum of reciprocals of positive squarefree integers diverges.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Show that ∑' 1/n, the sum being over squarefree integers, diverges.” The Lean statement precisely encodes the series over positive squarefree integers by restricting the summand to be 1/n when n ≠ 0 and squarefree, and 0 otherwise. “¬ Summable” in ℝ matches the intended “diverges.” The domain ℕ and the guard `n ≠ 0` correctly ensure only positive integers are included (avoiding 1/0). The custom definition of squarefree is mathematically equivalent to the usual notion.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: The natural statement sums over squarefree integers (implicitly positive). The Lean code sums over ℕ with an indicator to restrict to n ≥ 1 and squarefree, which is equivalent.
- Divergence notion: “diverges” corresponds to “¬ Summable” in ℝ. Terms are nonnegative, so this is the correct formalization.
- Definition of squarefree: A standard equivalent formulation is used; no vacuity or placeholders. No extra assumptions are introduced.

No substantive discrepancies found. The translation is faithful.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: ""Prove that the power series ∑ n z^n does not converge on any point of the unit circle.""
- The code asserts: For any z with |z|=1, the complex series ∑ n z^n is not summable. This matches the intended meaning: the coefficient a_n = n, forming the power series ∑ a_n z^n = ∑ n z^n, and the unit circle is |z|=1.
- Indexing from n=0 in Lean vs sometimes from n=1 in informal math is immaterial here because the n=0 term is 0 and does not affect convergence.

- The theorem `integral_sin_div_id_tendsto : Tendsto (fun R : ℝ => ∫ x in 0..R, (sin x) / x) atTop (𝓝 (π / 2))` states: as R → ∞, the function R ↦ ∫_{0..R} (sin x)/x dx converges to π/2. The comment explicitly says this is the way they encode the improper integral ∫_0^∞.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement is “Show that ∫_0^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2.” A standard definition of this improper integral is exactly lim_{R→∞} ∫_{0}^{R} (sin x)/x dx. The Lean theorem states that this limit equals π/2, i.e., the improper integral equals π/2. So it is a faithful translation.

A minor technical nuance: in Lean, (sin x)/x is a total function (with value 0 at x = 0), but this only changes the integrand on a measure-zero set, so the interval integral on [0, R] matches the usual improper interpretation (or Lebesgue integral of the measurable representative). The provided comment also clarifies the intended interpretation.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

  • For an arbitrary natural number k, let p = 2^(2^k) + 1. With the hypothesis `hp` that p is prime, the conclusion is that the multiplicative order of 3 in the ring ZMod p (i.e., modulo p) equals 2^(2^k), which is p − 1. This encodes that 3 is a primitive root mod p.
  • No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is just a single theorem statement. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the task here is to check faithfulness of the statement, not its proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""If p = 2^n + 1 is a Fermat prime, show that 3 is a primitive root modulo p."" By definition of a Fermat prime, n is itself a power of 2, say n = 2^k, so p = 2^(2^k) + 1. The code makes this explicit by quantifying over k and assuming Primeness of p. The conclusion that `orderOf (3 : ZMod p) = p - 1` matches exactly the meaning of ""3 is a primitive root modulo p"".
- Using `orderOf (3 : ZMod p) = p - 1` is a standard formalization of the primitive root property (it encodes that 3 generates the multiplicative group modulo p). The use of ZMod rather than explicitly (ZMod p)ˣ is acceptable because for prime p (and p ≠ 3), 3 is a unit in ZMod p, and equality of orders is the same condition. In any case, the statement `orderOf ... = p - 1` implies 3 is a unit.

3) Final comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The only potential subtlety is the edge case k = 0, where p = 3; then 3 mod 3 is 0 and cannot be a primitive root. However, the natural language statement as written does not exclude this case either (many texts intend k ≥ 1 when discussing Fermat primes in this context). Since both the English and Lean versions include the same form p = 2^(2^k) + 1 with p prime, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the intended claim. There are no vacuous definitions or mismatches in quantification or meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement faithfully captures the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- `open Complex` allows use of complex-number-related names without qualification.
- The theorem `Shakarchi_exercise_1_19c (z : ℂ) (hz : |z| = 1) (hz_ne : z ≠ 1) : Summable fun n : ℕ => z ^ n / (n : ℂ)` states: For a complex number z with |z| = 1 and z ≠ 1, the series with general term z^n / n (viewed as a function from ℕ to ℂ) is summable (i.e., convergent). This is exactly the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^n / n over ℕ.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but that is acceptable per instructions; we only audit the statement.

Technical note: In Lean/Mathlib, the term at n = 0 is z^0 / 0 = 1/0, and Complex has inv 0 = 0 by definition, so the n=0 term is 0. Hence the series from n = 0 equals the usual series starting at n = 1, so convergence is unaffected.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the power series ∑ z^n / n converges at every point of the unit circle except z = 1."" This standardly means for each z with |z| = 1 and z ≠ 1, the series ∑_{n≥1} z^n / n converges (not necessarily absolutely). The Lean theorem asserts precisely that: for all z with |z| = 1 and z ≠ 1, the series ∑_{n∈ℕ} z^n/n is Summable. In complex normed spaces, `Summable` is the usual notion of convergence of series, not necessarily absolute. Thus the meaning matches.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: The Lean series runs over ℕ (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), while the classical series usually starts at n = 1. Since the n=0 term is 0 in Lean, this difference is immaterial for convergence.
- Domain and exception: Both specify |z| = 1 and exclude z = 1.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; just a theorem statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement, with only a standard indexing convention difference that does not affect convergence.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Liouville_theorem_of_injective_of_entire (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf_inj: Injective f) (hf_ent : Continuous f) : ∃ a b : ℂ, a ≠ 0 ∧ f = fun z => a * z + b := by sorry`
  This states: For a function f: ℂ → ℂ, if f is injective and continuous, then there exist complex numbers a and b with a ≠ 0 such that f(z) = a*z + b for all z.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that all entire functions that are also injective take the form f(z) = az + b, a, b ∈ ℂ and a ≠ 0.""
- Key hypothesis difference: The Lean code assumes `Continuous f`, whereas the natural statement requires f to be entire (holomorphic on all of ℂ). In Mathlib, ""entire"" would be captured by something like `Entire f` or `Differentiable ℂ f` (or `HolomorphicOn ℂ f` on univ). Continuity is far weaker than being entire. This is a substantial change in meaning; the Lean statement asserts a much stronger (and false) claim.
- The conclusion matches the intended form: existence of a,b ∈ ℂ with a ≠ 0 and f(z) = a z + b.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem replaces ""entire"" with ""continuous"". There are many continuous injective maps ℂ → ℂ that are not affine-linear, so the Lean statement is not only a mismatch; it is false as a mathematical statement. No auxiliary definitions are introduced, so there are no vacuous placeholders, but the core hypothesis is incorrect.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the critical replacement of ""entire"" by ""continuous"".

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in the mathematical library; no impact on the statement content.
- The header comment correctly restates the problem in natural language.
- theorem putnam_exercise_2018_b4 {a : ℝ} {x : ℕ → ℝ} ... : The theorem is universally quantifying over a real number a and a sequence x: ℕ → ℝ.
- (h0 : x 0 = 1): Encodes the initial condition x_0 = 1.
- (h1 : x 1 = a): Encodes x_1 = a.
- (h2 : x 2 = a): Encodes x_2 = a, so together h1 and h2 capture “x_1 = x_2 = a”.
- (hrec : ∀ n, n ≥ 2 → x (n+1) = 2 * x n * x (n-1) - x (n-2)): Encodes the recurrence for all n ≥ 2: x_{n+1} = 2 x_n x_{n-1} − x_{n-2}. The use of n ≥ 2 ensures the indices n−1 and n−2 are meaningful (though Lean’s Nat subtraction is total, this matches the intended domain of the recurrence).
- (∃ n, x n = 0) → ∃ p : ℕ, p > 0 ∧ ∀ m, x (m + p) = x m: This states that if there exists some n with x_n = 0, then the sequence is periodic with some positive period p, i.e., x_{m+p} = x_m for all m.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean hypotheses exactly encode the initial conditions and recurrence as in the problem.
- The conclusion exactly formalizes “the sequence is periodic” as existence of a positive period p with x(m+p) = x(m) for all m.
- The existential statement (∃ n, x n = 0) matches “if x_n = 0 for some n”.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions or placeholders are introduced; only meaningful hypotheses and a theorem statement are given.
- No mismatch in indexing or off-by-one errors; n ≥ 2 aligns with the original statement’s domain for the recurrence.

Final check:
- The formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement. There are no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_4_4 (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (h4 : p % 4 = 1) (a : ZMod p) (ha : a ≠ 0) : ... := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for a natural number p, assumed prime (`hp`) and congruent to 1 mod 4 (`h4`), and an element `a` in the finite field ZMod p with `a ≠ 0` (`ha`). The goal is to prove an equivalence of two statements.
- Left side: `(∀ d : ℕ, 0 < d → d < p - 1 → a ^ d ≠ 1)`
  This says: for all natural numbers d with 0 < d < p - 1, the power a^d is not equal to 1 in ZMod p. Interpreted in the multiplicative group of the field ZMod p, this means a has no smaller positive order less than p - 1. Since a ≠ 0 and p is prime, ZMod p is a field and Fermat/Euler implies a^(p-1) = 1, so this is equivalent to saying that the order of a is exactly p - 1, i.e., a is a primitive root modulo p.
- Right side: `(∀ d : ℕ, 0 < d → d < p - 1 → (-a) ^ d ≠ 1)`
  Similarly, for all d with 0 < d < p - 1, (-a)^d ≠ 1, i.e., -a has order p - 1; equivalently, -a is a primitive root modulo p.
- The equivalence ↔ is exactly the statement that a is a primitive root mod p iff -a is, under the assumption p ≡ 1 (mod 4).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: For a prime p of the form 4t+1, show that a is a primitive root modulo p iff -a is a primitive root modulo p. The Lean code assumes p is prime, p % 4 = 1 (i.e., p ≡ 1 mod 4), and takes a ∈ ZMod p with a ≠ 0. Using the characterization of a primitive root in a cyclic group of order p−1 as an element whose powers do not hit 1 for any 0 < d < p − 1, the Lean predicates on a and -a are precisely those primitive root conditions. The ambient ring/group is ZMod p, which is appropriate for “mod p”. Thus the theorem statement matches the original.
- The extra hypothesis `a ≠ 0` matches the standard requirement that a primitive root must be a unit modulo p. Since p is prime, ZMod p is a field and a ≠ 0 is equivalent to being a unit. This is a natural, harmless explicitization of the intended context.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code uses the condition `∀ 0<d<p-1, a^d ≠ 1` instead of an explicit `IsPrimitiveRoot`; but in this context (ZMod p with p prime and a ≠ 0), this is equivalent to being a primitive root, because a^(p−1) = 1 holds automatically. So this is a faithful formalization.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing the statement.
- The statement involves exactly the same mathematical content: p prime with p ≡ 1 mod 4, and equivalence of being a primitive root for a and -a. There are no hidden weakenings or strengthenings.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language problem.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- Comment explains the goal: show sin(pi/12) is algebraic by exhibiting a nonzero rational polynomial that vanishes at sin(pi/12).
- `theorem sin_pi_div_12_is_algebraic : ∃ p : Polynomial ℚ, p ≠ 0 ∧ p.eval (Real.sin (Real.pi / 12)) = 0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: There exists a polynomial p with rational coefficients, with p ≠ 0, such that p(sin(π/12)) = 0.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language claims “sin(π/12) is an algebraic number.” Over ℚ, this is equivalent to the existence of a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients that has sin(π/12) as a root. The theorem statement is exactly this existential formulation. So conceptually it matches the standard definition of algebraicity over ℚ for a real number.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only technical issue is that in Lean, `p : Polynomial ℚ` and `p.eval (Real.sin ...)` is ill-typed; one typically needs `eval₂ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)` or `aeval` to evaluate a ℚ-polynomial at a real number. The mathematically faithful Lean statement would be `∃ p : Polynomial ℚ, p ≠ 0 ∧ Polynomial.eval₂ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ) (Real.sin (Real.pi / 12)) p = 0` (or using `aeval` with `IsAlgebraic ℚ`), but this is a minor technicality about evaluation, not a change in mathematical content.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem is a direct existential statement corresponding to algebraicity.

Conclusion: The mathematical meaning is faithful to the natural language statement. Minor Lean-typing technicality prevents literal compilation as written, but the intended proposition is correct and a standard formalization of “algebraic number.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Putnam_exercise_2018_a5 (f : ℝ → ℝ)` introduces a real-valued function on the reals.
- `(h_smooth : ContDiff ℝ ⊤ f)` asserts that f is infinitely differentiable (C^∞) over ℝ. In Mathlib, `ContDiff ℝ ⊤ f` means f is differentiable to all orders.
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)` encodes f(0) = 0.
- `(h1 : f 1 = 1)` encodes f(1) = 1.
- `(h_nonneg : ∀ x, 0 ≤ f x)` encodes f(x) ≥ 0 for all real x.
- Conclusion: `∃ n : ℕ, ∃ x : ℝ, n > 0 ∧ (Function.iterate deriv n f) x < 0` means there exists a positive integer n and a real number x such that the n-th derivative of f at x is negative. In Mathlib, `deriv : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ` is the (total) derivative operator, and `Function.iterate deriv n f` denotes applying the derivative operator n times to f, i.e., the n-th derivative function. Thus `(Function.iterate deriv n f) x < 0` is exactly `f^{(n)}(x) < 0`. The condition `n > 0` ensures n is a positive integer, matching the statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypotheses match exactly: infinitely differentiable, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, and f(x) ≥ 0 for all x.
- The conclusion matches exactly: existence of a positive integer n and real x with the n-th derivative negative at x.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; `deriv` and `ContDiff` are standard Mathlib notions. Using `Function.iterate` to represent the n-th derivative is appropriate and standard in Mathlib.

3) Final check:
- The Lean theorem statement is essentially the same as the natural language problem. No extra constraints or weakenings are introduced. The quantifiers and inequalities align correctly. Hence, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Use Mathlib and open the Complex namespace.
- The theorem `shakarchi_exercise_1_13b` is stated with:
  - `Ω : Set ℂ`: Ω is a subset of the complex plane.
  - `hΩ : IsOpen Ω`: Ω is open.
  - `hconn : IsConnected Ω`: Ω is connected.
  - `f : ℂ → ℂ`: a function f from ℂ to ℂ.
  - `hf : IsHolomorphicOn f Ω`: f is holomorphic on Ω.
  - `c : ℝ`: a real constant.
  - `h : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).im = c`: the imaginary part of f is constant and equal to c on Ω.
  - Conclusion: `∃ w : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = w`: there exists a complex number w such that f(z) = w for all z in Ω, i.e., f is constant on Ω.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: ""Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set Ω. Prove that if Im(f) is constant, then f is constant.""
- The Lean theorem adds the assumption that Ω is connected. With this assumption, the conclusion that f is globally constant on Ω follows. The statement otherwise matches: holomorphic on Ω, Im(f) constant, conclude f is constant (exists w with f ≡ w on Ω).

Step 3: Compare the two statements carefully.
- Difference: The Lean code requires Ω to be connected (`IsConnected Ω`), while the natural language statement only mentions Ω is open.
- Mathematical nuance: Without connectedness, the strongest correct conclusion is that f is constant on each connected component of Ω, not necessarily globally constant on Ω. Thus, the Lean statement is a natural and standard specialization that makes the claim correct and yields the intended conclusion.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions (`IsOpen`, `IsConnected`, `IsHolomorphicOn`) are standard Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization up to the added (standard) connectedness hypothesis. This is a slight specialization and in line with how the theorem is typically stated to ensure correctness.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Putnam_exercise_1999_b4 (f : ℝ → ℝ)`: Let f be a real-valued function on ℝ.
- `(hf : ContDiff ℝ 3 f)`: f is C^3; i.e., f has continuous derivatives up to order 3. This matches “f has a continuous third derivative.”
- `(h_pos : ∀ x, 0 < f x)`: For every real x, f(x) > 0.
- `(h_f' : ∀ x, 0 < deriv f x)`: For every real x, f′(x) > 0.
- `(h_f'' : ∀ x, 0 < deriv (deriv f) x)`: For every real x, f″(x) > 0. Here `deriv (deriv f) x` is the second derivative at x.

- `(h_bound : ∀ x, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≤ f x)`: For every real x, f‴(x) ≤ f(x).
- Conclusion: `∀ x, deriv f x < 2 * f x`: For every real x, f′(x) < 2 f(x).

All derivatives are expressed via Mathlib’s `deriv` operator. The hypothesis `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` ensures the existence and continuity of derivatives up to order 3, so iterated uses of `deriv` are legitimate and correspond to f′, f″, f‴.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumptions: f has a continuous third derivative; f, f′, f″, f‴ are positive everywhere; and f‴ ≤ f everywhere. The conclusion: f′(x) < 2 f(x) for all x. The Lean statement exactly encodes these assumptions and the desired conclusion, using standard Mathlib notions (`ContDiff`, `deriv`).

3) Final check for differences:
- Regularity: “continuous third derivative” is captured (and slightly strengthened in the standard way) by `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` (C^3), which is the customary formalization. This is acceptable.
- Positivity and inequality assumptions match precisely, quantified over all x ∈ ℝ.
- Conclusion matches exactly.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct. 

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The theorem `exists_involution_of_even_finite_group {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : 2 ∣ Fintype.card G) : ∃ a : G, a ≠ 1 ∧ a = a⁻¹` reads: Let G be a type with a group structure and finite (Fintype). Assume `h` that 2 divides the cardinality of G (i.e., G has even order). Then there exists an element `a : G` such that `a ≠ 1` (not the identity) and `a = a⁻¹` (self-inverse). The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable since we are only auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""If G is a finite group of even order, show that there must be an element a ≠ e such that a = a^{-1}.""
- Lean: Assumes G is a finite group (`[Group G] [Fintype G]`), even order (`2 ∣ Fintype.card G`), and concludes existence of `a ≠ 1` with `a = a⁻¹`.
- Identity `e` in natural language corresponds to `1` in Lean. Everything matches exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., commutativity) are imposed.
- No weakening/strengthening: the statement is neither generalized nor specialized beyond the original. It is a direct formalization.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {M : Type _} [TopologicalSpace M]`: We are working in an arbitrary topological space M.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_26 (U : Set M) : IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x ∈ U, x ∉ closure (M \ U) := by sorry`: For any subset U of M, U is open if and only if every point x in U is not in the closure of the complement of U (here written as M \ U, i.e., Uᶜ).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: “A set U ⊆ M is open iff none of its points are limits of its complement.”
- In topology, for x ∉ A, “x is a limit point of A” is equivalent to “x ∈ closure(A)”, since every neighborhood of x meeting A is exactly the definition of adherence, and removing x from A is irrelevant if x ∉ A. Here A = M \ U, and for x ∈ U we indeed have x ∉ A. Thus “x is not a limit point of the complement” is equivalent to “x ∉ closure(M \ U)”.
- Therefore, the Lean statement `IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x ∈ U, x ∉ closure (M \ U)` matches exactly the natural language statement.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable per instructions. The formalization generalizes to an arbitrary topological space (not just metric spaces), which is a standard and acceptable generalization.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No discrepancies affecting correctness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that every subset of ℕ is clopen."" The Lean statement says: For all `s : Set ℕ`, `IsClopen s`. This is exactly the same assertion, interpreted in Mathlib's default topology on `ℕ` (which is discrete), hence a standard interpretation of the phrase.

3) Final check:
- The two statements match exactly. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The only placeholder is the proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable since we are auditing the translation of the statement, not its proof. No mismatch in quantifiers or notions: `Set ℕ` corresponds to ""subset of ℕ,"" and `IsClopen` corresponds to ""clopen.""

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

This statement is encoded here in a form that does not commit to a particular

reconstructs f on all of ℂ, and that for each such sequence at least one

  ∃ p : Polynomial ℂ, ∀ z : ℂ, f z = p.eval z := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem is named `Shakarchi_exercise_2_13` with input `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
- Hypothesis `h_taylor`: For every center `z0 : ℂ`, there exists a sequence of coefficients `c : ℕ → ℂ` such that:
  - For all `z : ℂ`, `f z = ∑' (n : ℕ), c n * (z - z0) ^ n`. This asserts that `f` is represented everywhere on ℂ by a power series centered at `z0` with coefficients `c`.
  - Additionally, there exists some index `n` with `c n = 0`. So at least one coefficient in that power series is zero.
- Conclusion: There exists a polynomial `p : Polynomial ℂ` such that for all `z : ℂ`, `f z = p.eval z`.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: f is analytic everywhere (entire) and for each z0, in the Taylor expansion of f at z0, at least one coefficient is 0. Prove f is a polynomial.
- The Lean hypothesis `h_taylor` encodes that for each z0, f admits a (globally convergent) power series expansion about z0 with at least one vanishing coefficient. For entire functions, the Taylor series at any center has infinite radius of convergence and equals f on all of ℂ, so requiring equality for all z is standard. While the code does not explicitly say these `c` are the Taylor coefficients, uniqueness of power series expansions (the RHS equals f on all of ℂ, hence on any neighborhood) forces `c` to be precisely the Taylor coefficients. Thus the condition “∃ n, c n = 0” matches “at least one Taylor coefficient is zero”.
- The conclusion matches “f is a polynomial,” formalized as equality of f with a polynomial evaluation function everywhere.

Step 3: Final check of sameness and discrepancies.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; there are no auxiliary fake definitions.
- The only technical deviation is encoding analyticity via global power series representation instead of stating analyticity explicitly. For entire functions, this is equivalent, and in fact slightly stronger but not in a way that changes the intended theorem.
- Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully captures the original problem.

  This asserts there exists a unique pair (a, n) of natural numbers such that a > 0, n > 0, and the integer equation (a^(n+1) : Int) - ((a+1)^n : Int) = 2001 holds. The powers are computed in ℕ and then coerced to ℤ for the subtraction and equality with 2001.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- ""Positive integers"" is captured by `a n : ℕ` together with `a > 0 ∧ n > 0`.
- The equation is exactly `a^(n+1) - (a+1)^n = 2001` in ℤ, matching the statement.
- Uniqueness of the pair is expressed via `∃! (a n : ℕ), ...`. In Lean, multiple binders for `∃!` nest, which is equivalent to uniqueness of the pair under this property. This is standard and faithful to the intended uniqueness of the ordered pair.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted (by `sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check:
- The formal statement matches the natural language exactly: existence and uniqueness of positive integers a, n satisfying the given equation. No discrepancies in domain, quantifiers, or the equation itself.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MeasureTheory`, `open Real`: Use Mathlib and open measure theory and real number namespaces.
- `lemma Shakarchi_exercise_3_4 (a : ℝ) (ha : 0 < a) : ∫ x : ℝ, (x * sin x) / (x ^ 2 + a ^ 2) = π * exp (-a) := by sorry`
  This states: For a real number a with a > 0, the integral over ℝ (with respect to Lebesgue measure) of the function x ↦ (x*sin x)/(x^2 + a^2) equals π * exp(−a). No proof is provided.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is: Show that ∫_{−∞}^{∞} (x sin x)/(x^2 + a^2) dx = π e^{−a} for a > 0.
- The integrand, parameter range (a > 0), and right-hand side π e^{−a} match, and `exp (−a)` is the same as e^{−a}.
- However, the key issue is the notion of integral. The Lean code uses the Lebesgue integral over ℝ, denoted by `∫ x : ℝ, ...`. In Mathlib, this is the Bochner/Lebesgue integral and is only defined (in a nontrivial way) for integrable functions; otherwise, by convention, `∫ f = 0` when `f` is not integrable. The given function behaves like sin x / x at infinity, hence is not absolutely integrable on ℝ, so it is not integrable in the Lebesgue sense; the improper Riemann integral does converge conditionally. Therefore, the natural statement refers to an improper (or principal value/limit) integral from −∞ to ∞, while the code asserts an equality for the Lebesgue integral over ℝ.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The natural statement is about an improper integral (limit of integrals over bounded intervals extending to infinity), which converges conditionally. The Lean statement is about the Lebesgue integral over ℝ without any integrability or limiting/principal value formulation. In Mathlib, this distinction matters: the Lebesgue integral of this function over ℝ is not defined in the usual finite sense; the notation `∫` returns 0 when not integrable, making the stated equality false unless further conditions or a different integral notion (improper integral via limits) is used.
- Thus, the translation is not faithful: it should have used an improper integral formulation (e.g., a limit of integrals over symmetric intervals) or added appropriate hypotheses about conditional integrability with a principal value interpretation, rather than the plain Lebesgue integral over ℝ.

Conclusion: While very close syntactically, the mathematical meaning differs in an important way (Lebesgue vs improper integral). Hence it is not a faithful translation.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The hypotheses `[Group G] [Fintype G]` state G is a finite group, matching the natural language.
- The parameter `(a : G)` corresponds to “given a ∈ G”.
- The conclusion `∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ a ^ n = 1` asserts there exists a positive integer n with a^n equal to the identity. Lean uses `1` for the group identity (the same as e in the statement). This is exactly the original statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification matches: for each a, there exists such an n, which can depend on a.

  - Take elements a, b in G.

No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib’s standard notions: `Subgroup G`, `H.Normal`, and integer exponentiation on a group element. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is to check translation faithfulness, not provide a proof.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- Natural language: “Let G be a group such that all subgroups of G are normal in G. If a, b ∈ G, prove that ba = a^j b for some j.”
- Lean: Exactly formalizes this as: for a group G with every subgroup normal, and elements a, b in G, there exists an integer j with b * a = a ^ j * b.
- The quantifiers and objects match. The exponent is an integer as specified. The equation and order of multiplication coincide.

  • Hypothesis: `p` is a real number with `1 < p` (i.e., p > 1).
  • Conclusion: The sequence `k ↦ 1 / ((k+2) * (log(k+2))^p)` is summable over `k : ℕ`. In terms of series, this is the convergence of ∑_{k=0}^∞ 1/((k+2)(log(k+2))^p), which is the same as ∑_{n=2}^∞ 1/(n (log n)^p) via the change of variables n = k+2.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to prove the convergence of ∑ 1/(k (log k)^p) when p > 1, typically understood for k ≥ 2 to avoid log singularities. The Lean theorem asserts the summability of the shifted sequence (starting at k+2), which is mathematically equivalent to summability from k ≥ 2 of the original terms. The use of `Real.log` matches the natural logarithm. The exponent `^ p` with real p denotes real exponentiation (Real.rpow) in Mathlib, aligning with the intended expression (log(k))^p. The hypothesis `1 < p` precisely matches p > 1. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it's just a theorem statement.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement is an equivalent formulation (index shift) of the original series convergence statement. No change in mathematical content; only a standard reindexing to avoid k=0,1. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- The docstring states the exercise: nested decreasing intersection of nonempty compact sets is nonempty.
- `open Set`: We can use set notation.
- `variable {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α]`: Work in an arbitrary topological space α.
- The theorem `Pugh_exercise_2_92` states: Given a sequence K : ℕ → Set α, if each K n is compact (`IsCompact (K n)`), each is nonempty (`(K n).Nonempty`), and the sequence is nested decreasing (`K (n + 1) ⊆ K n` for all n), then the intersection over all n, `⋂ n, K n`, is nonempty.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Give a direct proof that the nested decreasing intersection of nonempty covering compact sets is nonempty.""
- The Lean theorem precisely formalizes: a nested decreasing sequence of nonempty compact sets has a nonempty intersection. This matches the standard interpretation of the statement. The word ""covering"" in the prose is likely a stylistic adjective or redundant; the mathematical content is exactly captured by the Lean statement: nonempty compact sets, nested decreasing, intersection nonempty.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced, and all concepts are standard Mathlib notions (IsCompact, Nonempty, subset condition, infinite intersection). There are no vacuous placeholders.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: The Lean code uses a countable sequence (ℕ-indexed), which aligns with the usual meaning of ""nested decreasing"" in many texts. The natural language does not explicitly specify an index set, but a sequence is a standard and faithful formalization.
- Topological assumptions: The Lean code works in an arbitrary topological space; the natural language statement does not add extra separation axioms either. This is a reasonable formalization choice for translation purposes.
- The presence of `sorry` only omits the proof; the task is about translation, not proving. No vacuous definitions are used.

- `theorem exists_n_not_perfect_square (a b c : Int) : ... := by sorry`:
  - Quantifies over integers a, b, c.

  - Here, `n` is treated as an integer in the arithmetic via coercions; the expression `n^3 + a * n^2 + b * n + c` is an integer. `Int.sqrt` denotes the integer square root. The condition `Int.sqrt(x)^2 ≠ x` is the standard way to express that x is not a perfect square (and in particular, that the square root is not an integer).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: For any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive integer n such that sqrt(n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c) is not an integer.
- Lean: For any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive natural number n (i.e., positive integer) such that the integer square root squared does not equal the number: equivalently, the number is not a perfect square. This is exactly the formalization of “its square root is not an integer.” If the expression were a perfect square (and nonnegative), its real square root would be an integer; if it is negative, then certainly “sqrt” is not an integer, and the inequality also holds. Thus the Lean property matches the intended meaning.

Step 3: Final check for equivalence and discrepancies
- Quantifiers and domains match: a, b, c ∈ ℤ; ∃ n ∈ ℕ with 0 < n (a positive integer).
- Predicate matches: “sqrt(...) is not an integer” is faithfully encoded as “the integer square root squared is not equal to the number,” i.e., the number is not a perfect square.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with `sorry` proof placeholder.
- No scope creep or specialization/generalization beyond the original statement.

- It imports Mathlib and states a theorem `herstein_exercise_2_2_6c`.
- The context: `{G : Type*} [Group G] {n : ℕ}` means G is a group and n is a natural number.
- Hypothesis `hn : 1 < n` matches the natural language requirement that n > 1.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n` matches the condition that (ab)^n = a^n b^n for all a, b in G, with n fixed.
- Conclusion: `∀ a b : G, (a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1` states that for all a, b, the commutator (aba^{-1}b^{-1}) raised to the power n(n−1) equals the identity (1 in Lean, which corresponds to e).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The Lean theorem exactly captures: G is a group, there exists a fixed n > 1 such that (ab)^n = a^n b^n for all a,b, and the desired conclusion about the commutator power equals the identity for all a,b.
- The use of `n : ℕ` rather than an integer is appropriate because the statement only uses positive exponents and posits n > 1; `n * (n - 1)` in Nat matches the integer product since `1 < n` prevents truncation issues.
- Identity element is written as `1` in Lean, which is the same as `e` in group notation.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct formalization of the claim. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is about faithful translation, not proving it.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. There are no discrepancies.

1. Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {R : Type*} [Ring R]` declares a general ring R (not assumed commutative, since `Ring` in Mathlib is the noncommutative ring typeclass) as the ambient structure.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_2_6 (a x : R) (ha : a * a = 0) : a * (a * x + x * a) = (a * x + x * a) * a := by sorry` states: For elements a, x in R, assuming ha: a^2 = 0, we have a*(a*x + x*a) = (a*x + x*a)*a. This is exactly the statement that the element (a x + x a) commutes with a.

2. Whole translation vs original statement:
- Natural language: ""If a^2 = 0 in R, show that ax + xa commutes with a."" Interpreted as: For any ring R and any a, x in R with a^2=0, (ax + xa) commutes with a, i.e., a(ax+xa) = (ax+xa)a.
- Lean theorem matches perfectly: same hypotheses and the exact equality expressing commutation.

3. Final check for differences:
- Ring possibly noncommutative: satisfied by `[Ring R]` (as opposed to `[CommRing R]`).
- Universal quantification over x and a: explicit in the theorem arguments.
- ""Commutes with a"" expressed via equality rather than `Commute a (a*x + x*a)`, but these are equivalent; expressing the equality is faithful.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no red flags.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib. No impact on the statement.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_43 (G : Type _) [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 9) : ∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a := by sorry`
  This states: For any type G equipped with a group structure and which is finite, if the cardinality of G is 9, then for all elements a, b in G, we have a * b = b * a. That is, every pair of elements commute.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian."" The Lean statement assumes G is a finite group with |G| = 9 and concludes that multiplication is commutative for all elements, which is the definition of G being abelian. Thus, the theorem exactly captures the claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- ""order 9"" is represented as `Fintype.card G = 9` — correct.
- ""abelian"" is represented as `∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a` — logically equivalent to being an abelian group.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
There are no discrepancies; the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language:
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_31 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] {p n m : ℕ} [Fact (Nat.Prime p)]` sets up a finite (not assumed abelian) group G, and natural numbers p, n, m with p prime.
- `(H : Subgroup G)` introduces a subgroup H of G.
- `(hG : Fintype.card G = p ^ n * m)` assumes the order of G is p^n * m.
- `(hm : ¬ p ∣ m)` assumes p does not divide m.
- `(hH : Fintype.card H = p ^ n)` assumes the order of H is p^n.
- The conclusion `∀ (φ : G ≃* G), φ.toEquiv '' (H : Set G) = (H : Set G)` says that for every group automorphism φ of G, the image of H under φ (viewed as a set) is exactly H. This is a standard expression of “H is characteristic in G.”
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement.

2) Assess faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement explicitly assumes G is an abelian (commutative) finite group. The Lean code only assumes `[Group G]`, not `[CommGroup G]`; so it drops the abelian hypothesis.
- All other hypotheses match: finiteness, |G| = p^n m with p prime and p ∤ m, H a subgroup of order p^n. The conclusion matches characteristic: invariance under all automorphisms, expressed as equality of images.
- Using set equality of φ-images is appropriate and equivalent to φ(H) = H for automorphisms.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Difference: The code states a stronger theorem (no abelian hypothesis). The original relies on abelian structure to ensure uniqueness of the p-primary component; without abelian this is generally false. Hence the code does not faithfully translate the original statement.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts. The only issue is the missing commutativity assumption.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to omission of the abelian hypothesis; otherwise the formulation is correct.

- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_2_3 {G : Type*} [Group G] :`: Let G be a type with a group structure.
- Hypothesis: `(∃ k : Int, ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ k = a ^ k * b ^ k ∧ (a * b) ^ (k + 1) = a ^ (k + 1) * b ^ (k + 1) ∧ (a * b) ^ (k + 2) = a ^ (k + 2) * b ^ (k + 2))` means there exists an integer k such that for all a, b in G, the power-distribution identity holds for the three consecutive integers k, k+1, k+2.
- Conclusion: `∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a` i.e., G is abelian.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted (allowed for the purposes of translation).

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language
The natural language statement asserts: If (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for three consecutive integers i (understood as there exists such an i), then G is abelian. The Lean statement exactly encodes this as the existence of some k ∈ ℤ for which the identity holds for k, k+1, and k+2 for all a, b, concluding commutativity. Using `Int` is appropriate (and standard) for powers in a group and matches or slightly generalizes the typical phrasing; it still faithfully represents the statement since it includes the case of positive integers.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Quantification over a, b: Both versions require the identity to hold for all a, b in G.
- “Three consecutive integers”: Lean uses ∃ k : Int with k, k+1, k+2, which matches the standard interpretation.
- Conclusion: Both assert G is abelian, expressed as `a * b = b * a` in Lean.
No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. No mismatch in meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- Finite group: captured by `[Fintype G]`.
- Automorphism: captured by `φ : G ≃* G`.
- “More than three-fourths of the elements satisfy φ(x) = x⁻¹”: encoded precisely by `4 * card{subtype} > 3 * card G` where the subtype `{x : G // φ x = x⁻¹}` counts elements x with that property.

3) Final check for differences:
- The strict inequality “more than three-fourths” is correctly modeled by `>`, not `≥`.
- Counting the elements with the property via `Fintype.card {x : G // φ x = x⁻¹}` is the standard way in Lean to count such elements; proof irrelevance ensures this indeed counts elements, not proofs.
- “G is abelian” is equivalently expressed as universal commutativity `∀ a b, a * b = b * a`.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Use the Mathlib library.
- The theorem `Herstein_exercise_2_3_16` is stated for a type `G` with instances `[Group G]` and `[Fintype G]`. So `G` is a finite group.
- Hypothesis `h_nontriv : Nontrivial G`: The group is nontrivial (has at least two distinct elements).
- Hypothesis `h_subs : ∀ H : Subgroup G, H = (⊤ : Subgroup G) ∨ H = (⊥ : Subgroup G)`: Every subgroup of `G` is either the whole group (top) or the trivial subgroup (bottom). This formalizes “no proper subgroups.”
- Conclusion: `∃ (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p), Fintype.card G = p ∧ ∃ g : G, Subgroup.closure ({g} : Set G) = (⊤ : Subgroup G)`:
  - There exists a natural number `p` which is prime,
  - the cardinality (order) of `G` equals `p`,
  - and there exists an element `g` generating the whole group (i.e., `G` is cyclic).
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; only the statement matters for translation.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
Natural language: “If a group G has no proper subgroups, prove that G is cyclic of order p, where p is a prime number.”
- “No proper subgroups” is captured exactly by `∀ H, H = ⊤ ∨ H = ⊥`.
- “Cyclic of order p, p prime” is captured by the existence of `g` with `closure {g} = ⊤` and `Fintype.card G = p` with `Nat.Prime p`.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- The Lean statement assumes `[Fintype G]` (finiteness) and `Nontrivial G`. The natural language statement does not explicitly assume these. However:
  - Nontrivial is typically necessary; otherwise the trivial group would be a counterexample to the conclusion (order 1 is not prime).
  - Finiteness follows from the hypothesis in the usual mathematical proof; Lean’s statement specializes to the finite case, which is a standard and acceptable formalization since the conclusion uses the group order explicitly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is precise and matches the intended mathematical content.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to a mild specialization (explicit finiteness and nontriviality), which is standard and does not change the essence of the theorem.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's definitions and notations.
- The theorem `herstein_exercise_2_8_15` is stated with parameters `p q : ℕ` and assumptions `hp : Nat.Prime p`, `hq : Nat.Prime q`, `hq_div : q ∣ (p - 1)`, `hpgt : p > q`. This matches the hypothesis: p and q are primes with p > q and q divides p − 1.
- The quantification: `∀ (G H : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G] [Group H] [Fintype H], ...` means: for any two finite groups G and H.
- Assumptions `Fintype.card G = p * q` and `Fintype.card H = p * q` specify that both groups have order pq.
- The conditions `(¬∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a)` and `(¬∀ a b : H, a * b = b * a)` express that G and H are nonabelian (not all elements commute).
- The conclusion `Nonempty (G ≃* H)` asserts there exists a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between G and H.
- The `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided; this is acceptable per the task since we only audit the statement.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “If p > q are primes such that q | p − 1, then any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic.”
- The Lean theorem exactly captures this: for all finite groups G and H of order pq that are nonabelian, there exists a group isomorphism between them.
- The use of `G ≃* H` is the standard Mathlib notion of group isomorphism for multiplicative groups.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; all notions used (primality, divisibility, group, fintype, cardinality, isomorphism) are genuine Mathlib concepts.

Final check:
- The math problems are the same: same hypotheses (p, q primes, p > q, q ∣ p − 1), same conclusion (any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic). No scope mismatch or missing conditions.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- The theorem is named `Shakarchi_exercise_5_1` and is about a complex-valued function `f : ℂ → ℂ` and a sequence `a : ℕ → ℂ` intended to represent its zeros in the unit disk.
- Hypothesis `hf : IsHolomorphicOn f (ball (0 : ℂ) 1)` states that f is holomorphic on the open unit disk {z : |z| < 1}.
- Hypothesis `hb : ∃ M, ∀ z ∈ ball (0 : ℂ) 1, |f z| ≤ M` states that f is bounded on the unit disk.
- Hypothesis `hne : ¬(∀ z ∈ ball (0 : ℂ) 1, f z = 0)` states that f is not identically zero on the unit disk.
- Hypothesis `hz : ∀ n, a n ∈ ball (0 : ℂ) 1` states that each term of the sequence a lies in the unit disk.
- Hypothesis `hroot : ∀ n, f (a n) = 0` states that each a n is a zero of f.
- Hypothesis `hcomplete : ∀ z, z ∈ ball (0 : ℂ) 1 → f z = 0 → ∃ n, a n = z` says that every zero of f in the unit disk occurs somewhere in the sequence a (surjectivity onto the zero set).
- Conclusion: `Summable (fun n => 1 - |a n|)` states that the series ∑ (1 - |a_n|) converges (is summable over ℝ since 1 - |a n| is real and, by hz, positive).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The natural statement: If f is holomorphic and bounded in the unit disk, not identically zero, and z_k are its zeros (|z_k|<1), then ∑_n (1 - |z_n|) < ∞.
- The Lean hypotheses correctly capture: holomorphic on the (open) unit disk, bounded on the disk, not identically zero, and that (a n) are zeros in the disk and every zero appears at least once in the sequence.
- However, the Lean statement does not constrain the enumeration to avoid arbitrary infinite repetitions of the same zero. The combination of `hz`, `hroot`, and `hcomplete` ensures that the image of a is exactly the set of zeros in the disk, but allows a zero to appear infinitely many times in the sequence. In that case, the series would diverge (since each term is positive), which shows the Lean theorem is strictly stronger than the intended statement and, in fact, false under such pathological enumerations.
- The natural language phrase ""z1, z2, … are its zeros"" is normally interpreted as an enumeration of the zeros (typically with multiplicity, and certainly with only finitely many repetitions per zero). The Lean code permits infinite repetition and does not encode multiplicities. Counting multiplicities would only strengthen convergence, and removing multiplicity still yields a true statement; but permitting infinite repetitions goes beyond the intended meaning and breaks faithfulness.

Step 3: Final check
- Aside from the repetition/multiplicity issue, the translation of holomorphicity, boundedness, nontriviality, location of zeros, and the summability conclusion is accurate.
- The essential discrepancy: the Lean code allows sequences that list each zero infinitely often, which the natural statement does not intend. This is a significant mismatch in the quantification over the sequence of zeros.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to the missing constraint preventing infinite repetition (or appropriately counting multiplicities). Everything else matches well.

- `(N : Subgroup G)`: Let N be a subgroup of G.
- `(hφ : Function.Surjective (φ : G → G))`: Hypothesis that φ is surjective. Here there is a likely typo: `(φ : G → G)` should be `(φ : G → G')`, since φ maps into G'. As written, this annotation would be ill-typed; assuming the intended statement, it is “φ is surjective onto G'”.
- `(hN : IsNormal N)`: N is a normal subgroup of G. (Assuming `IsNormal` is the normality predicate for subgroups.)

- `by sorry`: Proof omitted (which is acceptable for translation auditing).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The intended theorem states: if φ: G → G' is a surjective group homomorphism and N is normal in G, then φ(N) is normal in G'. This matches the natural language statement exactly. The code uses `N.map φ` for the image subgroup, which is standard in Mathlib and corresponds to φ(N). The only issue is the apparent typo in the surjectivity hypothesis `(φ : G → G)` instead of `(φ : G → G')`. Interpreting it as intended (surjectivity onto G'), the formal statement aligns with the natural language.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: The surjectivity hypothesis is written with the wrong codomain (`G` instead of `G'`). This appears to be a simple typo; if corrected to `Function.Surjective (φ : G → G')`, the statement is fully faithful. Aside from this, there are no extra or vacuous definitions, and the conclusion `IsNormal (N.map φ)` matches “φ(N) ⊲ G'”.

Given the minor typo but otherwise exact match, this is a near-perfect translation.

  This defines T as the type of units (invertible elements) of the ring of 2×2 matrices over ZMod 2 (i.e., the field Z/2Z). Concretely, this is the group GL(2, Z/2Z), i.e., the set of invertible 2×2 matrices over the field Z_2, with multiplication given by matrix multiplication.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_1_34 : T ≃* Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := by sorry`
  This states that T is multiplicatively isomorphic (group isomorphic) to the group of permutations on a 3-element set, i.e., S_3. The `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language defines T as ""the group of 2×2 matrices A with entries in Z_2 such that det A ≠ 0."" Over a field (Z_2 is a field), this is exactly the group of invertible 2×2 matrices GL(2, Z_2). In Lean, `Units (Matrix ...)` precisely captures the invertible matrices, which coincide with the nonzero determinant condition over a field. Thus the definition of T is faithful.
- The target group is S_3, which Lean expresses as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`. This is standard and faithful.
- The theorem statement claims an isomorphism `T ≃* Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`, exactly matching “T is isomorphic to S_3”.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `Units`, `Matrix`, `Fin`, and `ZMod` are standard Mathlib notions. There are no auxiliary, misleading, or empty definitions.
- The small formalization difference (using Units rather than the subset with det ≠ 0) is not a discrepancy over a field; they are equivalent sets with the same group structure. Hence, the translation is legitimate and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem herstein_exercise_3_2_21 {α : Type _} (σ τ : α ≃ α)` declares a theorem for an arbitrary type α, with σ and τ permutations of α (Equiv α α are bijections, i.e., permutations).
- `(h_disjoint : ∀ x, σ x = x ∨ τ x = x)` states that for every element x, either σ fixes x or τ fixes x. This encodes “they disturb no common element,” i.e., there is no x that both σ and τ move.
- `(h_mul : σ.trans τ = Equiv.refl α)` states that the composition of σ and τ is the identity permutation. For Equiv, `σ.trans τ` is the equivalence whose action is `x ↦ τ (σ x)`, i.e., τ ∘ σ. `Equiv.refl α` is the identity on α.
- The conclusion `: σ = Equiv.refl α ∧ τ = Equiv.refl α` is that both σ and τ are the identity permutation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language hypothesis “σ, τ are two permutations that disturb no common element” is exactly encoded by σ, τ being equivalences and the predicate `∀ x, σ x = x ∨ τ x = x`.
- The condition “σ τ = e” is captured by `σ.trans τ = Equiv.refl α`. While there is a potential convention issue about composition order, in the context of permutations, στ = e implies τσ = e as well (since τ = σ⁻¹), so using τ ∘ σ = id is fully faithful to the intent.
- The conclusion “σ = τ = e” matches `σ = Equiv.refl α ∧ τ = Equiv.refl α`.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement and the natural statement match in all essential mathematical content. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all concepts (Equiv, composition via trans, identity via Equiv.refl) are standard Mathlib. The only minor difference is the composition order convention, which does not affect the truth of the statement in this context.

Hence, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib` brings in the standard math library.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] {p : ℕ} (P : Subgroup G)` sets the context: G is a group, p is a natural number, and P is a subgroup of G.
- The theorem `sylow_normal_fixed (hP : IsSylow p P) (hnormal : P.normal) (φ : G ≃* G) : P.map (φ.toMonoidHom) = P` reads: If P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G (captured by `IsSylow p P`) and P is normal in G (`P.normal`), then for any automorphism φ of G (`φ : G ≃* G`), the image of P under φ equals P. In Lean, `P.map (φ.toMonoidHom)` represents φ(P).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The original statement: ""If P ◁ G, P a p-Sylow subgroup of G, prove that φ(P) = P for every automorphism φ of G."" The Lean theorem has exactly these hypotheses and conclusion:
- P is a p-Sylow subgroup: `IsSylow p P`.
- P is normal: `P.normal`.
- φ is an automorphism: `G ≃* G`.
- Conclusion: φ(P) = P, expressed as `P.map (φ.toMonoidHom) = P`.
Quantification over φ is handled by taking φ as an arbitrary argument; this is equivalent to ""for every φ"".

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
Yes. There are no extra or missing assumptions. No auxiliary definitions are introduced. The equality expressed matches φ(P) = P exactly. The use of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable per the instructions, since only the statement’s faithfulness is evaluated. All concepts used (`IsSylow`, `P.normal`, automorphism as `G ≃* G`, `Subgroup.map`) are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem herstein_exercise_4_4_9 (p : ℕ) [Fact (p.Prime)] (hp_ne_two : p ≠ 2) :` 
  This asserts a theorem for a natural number p, assuming p is prime and p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime).
- `(p - 1) / 2 = Fintype.card { a : ZMod p // a ≠ 0 ∧ ∃ y : ZMod p, y ^ 2 = a } ∧` 
  The first conjunct states: The number of elements a in ZMod p with a ≠ 0 that are squares (i.e., there exists y in ZMod p with y^2 = a) equals (p - 1) / 2.
- `(p - 1) / 2 = Fintype.card { a : ZMod p // a ≠ 0 ∧ ¬ (∃ y : ZMod p, y ^ 2 = a) } := by sorry`
  The second conjunct states: The number of nonzero elements a in ZMod p that are not squares equals (p - 1) / 2. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language: ""Show that (p − 1)/2 of the numbers 1, 2, ..., p − 1 are quadratic residues and (p − 1)/2 are quadratic nonresidues mod p."" For an odd prime p, among the nonzero residue classes modulo p, exactly half are quadratic residues and half are nonresidues.
- The code counts nonzero residue classes in ZMod p (a finite field when p is prime), splitting them by whether they are squares (existence of y with y^2 = a) or not. This is the standard formalization of the statement. The condition a ≠ 0 excludes 0, matching the range 1,...,p-1. The sets are complementary (by ∃ vs ¬∃) within the nonzero elements, so the two equalities precisely state that half of the nonzero residues are squares and half are nonsquares.
- The use of ZMod p instead of the integers 1,...,p−1 is equivalent for counting purposes, since there is a bijection between {1,...,p−1} and the nonzero elements of ZMod p.
- The assumptions `[Fact (p.Prime)]` and `p ≠ 2` match the implicit requirement that p is an odd prime.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; Mathlib notions are standard (ZMod, Fintype.card, etc.).
- The statement exactly captures the intended counts of quadratic residues and nonresidues among nonzero residues modulo an odd prime p.
- Minor formalization detail: They quantify over all y : ZMod p without requiring y ≠ 0, but since a ≠ 0, any witness y must be nonzero anyway; thus no difference.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_10_1 {G : Type*} [Group G] (A : Subgroup G) [A.Normal] {b : G} (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hb : b ^ p = 1) (hb' : ∀ m : ℕ, 0 < m → m < p → b ^ m ≠ 1) (hb'' : b ∉ A) : A ⊓ Subgroup.closure ({b} : Set G) = ⊥ := by sorry`
  - We have a group `G` and a subgroup `A` of `G` that is normal (`[A.Normal]`).
  - We have an element `b : G` and a natural number `p : ℕ` which is prime (`hp : Nat.Prime p`).
  - `hb : b ^ p = 1` and `hb' : ∀ m, 0 < m → m < p → b ^ m ≠ 1` together encode that the order of `b` is exactly `p` (prime order).
  - `hb'' : b ∉ A` asserts that `b` is not in `A`.
  - The conclusion `A ⊓ Subgroup.closure ({b} : Set G) = ⊥` states that the intersection of `A` with the subgroup generated by `b` (i.e., the cyclic subgroup `(b)`) is the trivial subgroup `(e)` (`⊥`).

All notions used are standard mathlib definitions: `Subgroup.closure {b}` is the subgroup generated by `b`, and `⊓` is the infimum of subgroups, which is the intersection as subgroups. `⊥` is the trivial subgroup.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: Let `A` be a normal subgroup of `G`, `b` has prime order `p`, and `b ∉ A`. Show `A ∩ (b) = (e)`.
- Lean: Exactly encodes those hypotheses; the prime order condition is expressed via `b^p=1` and no smaller positive power equals `1`. The conclusion is exactly that the intersection of `A` with the cyclic subgroup generated by `b` is the trivial subgroup.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The code adds no extraneous content and uses precise mathlib concepts. It even includes the normality of `A` as in the statement (though the result does not require normality, including it does not harm). The cyclic subgroup `(b)` is correctly represented as `Subgroup.closure {b}` and `(e)` as `⊥`.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem is stated with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

The proof is omitted with sorry, but we only check the statement's faithfulness.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural definition of modulus: A continuous, strictly increasing μ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) with μ(s) → 0 as s → 0. The Lean definition matches this, encoding: positivity on (0, ∞), strictly increasing on (0, ∞), continuous on (0, ∞), and right-limit to 0 at 0.
- The natural definition of “f has modulus μ” on [a, b]: |f(s) − f(t)| ≤ μ(|s − t|) for all s, t ∈ [a, b]. The Lean definition has exactly this inequality for all s, t in the closed interval.
- The main claim: “a function is uniformly continuous iff it has a modulus of continuity” on [a, b]. The Lean theorem states precisely that f is uniformly continuous on Icc a b iff there exists such a μ satisfying the above difference inequality, given a ≤ b (which is implicit in the natural statement of [a, b]).

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- Domain/codomain of μ: Lean takes μ : ℝ → ℝ but restricts all substantive properties to (0, ∞), reflecting μ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) in the natural statement. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- Behavior at 0: The inequality uses μ(|s − t|), which includes |s − t| = 0 if s = t, hence evaluates μ(0). The natural definition has μ only on (0, ∞), so μ(0) is not specified. This is a minor technical difference; since the inequality is trivial at s = t, choosing any μ(0) ≥ 0 suffices, and the existence-quantifier in the theorem allows picking such an extension. The Lean definition of is_modulus_of_continuity places no constraint on μ(0), which is acceptable; the theorem asks for existence of a μ that works. This is a standard technical adaptation and does not change the mathematical meaning.
- All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders); they use standard Mathlib notions (StrictMonoOn, ContinuousOn, Tendsto, UniformContinuousOn), matching the intended concepts.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only standard, benign formalization choices.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “An element x of a ring R is called nilpotent if some power of x is zero. Prove that if x is nilpotent, then 1+x is a unit in R.”

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G H : Type _} [Group G] [Group H]`: We work with two groups G and H.
- The theorem `center_prod_centers` states an equality of sets of elements of the product group G × H.
- Left-hand side: `{ z : G × H | ∀ w : G × H, z * w = w * z }` is the set of all elements z in G × H that commute with every element w in G × H. This is exactly the center of the product group Z(G × H).

This is the cartesian product Z(G) × Z(H) seen as a subset of G × H.

2) Whole translation vs. natural language:
The natural language statement says: ""the center of the product of two groups is the product of their centers."" The code precisely formalizes this as an equality of sets: Z(G × H) = Z(G) × Z(H). It uses the defining property of the center (commuting with all elements) and expresses the product of centers as the set of pairs whose components lie in the centers of G and H.

3) Final check for differences:

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_5_4_3 (a : ℂ) (ha : (a ^ 5) + (Real.sqrt 2 : ℂ) * (a ^ 3) + (Real.sqrt 5 : ℂ) * (a ^ 2) + (Real.sqrt 7 : ℂ) * a + (Real.sqrt 11 : ℂ) = 0) :`
  Natural language: Let a be a complex number such that a^5 + √2 a^3 + √5 a^2 + √7 a + √11 = 0.

- Conclusion part 1: `(IsAlgAlgebraic (algebraMap ℚ ℂ) a) ∧`
  Intended meaning: a is algebraic over ℚ. The standard Mathlib formulation would be `IsAlgebraic ℚ a`, so the symbol `IsAlgAlgebraic (algebraMap ℚ ℂ) a` is suspicious, but assuming the code compiles, it is meant to assert algebraicity over ℚ.

- Conclusion part 2: `∃ p : (MvPolynomial (Fin (80 + 1)) ℚ), MvPolynomial.eval (fun i => a) p = 0`
  Intended meaning (as per the comment): degree at most 80, i.e., existence of a nonzero polynomial over ℚ of degree ≤ 80 with a as a root.
  Actual formal content: There exists a multivariable polynomial in 81 variables over ℚ such that evaluating at the assignment sending each variable to a yields 0. This does not encode “univariate polynomial of degree ≤ 80” at all. Moreover, it fails to require the polynomial be nonzero. In fact, p = 0 trivially satisfies this, making the statement vacuous and far weaker than the intended claim.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The hypothesis matches: a is a root in ℂ of the specified polynomial with coefficients √2, √5, √7, √11.
- The first conclusion attempts to state that a is algebraic over ℚ, which is correct in spirit (though the predicate name is likely nonstandard).
- The second conclusion is not a faithful expression of “degree at most 80.” The correct formalization should assert the existence of a nonzero univariate polynomial over ℚ of degree ≤ 80 with a as a root, e.g., `∃ p : Polynomial ℚ, p ≠ 0 ∧ p.natDegree ≤ 80 ∧ aeval a p = 0`. Using `MvPolynomial (Fin (80+1)) ℚ` with evaluation at all variables equal to a neither encodes univariate nor the degree constraint, and is trivially satisfied by p = 0.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The original claim: a is algebraic over ℚ and has minimal polynomial degree ≤ 80 (equivalently, there exists a nonzero polynomial over ℚ of degree ≤ 80 vanishing at a).
- The Lean code’s second part is a severe mismatch: it uses multivariable polynomials, no nonzero requirement, and no proper encoding of the degree bound. Hence the translation is not faithful.
- Additionally, the use of `IsAlgAlgebraic (algebraMap ℚ ℂ) a` is nonstandard; even if it compiles, it’s unclear and redundant given a proper degree statement. But the main issue is the vacuous and incorrect encoding of the “degree ≤ 80” condition.

Conclusion: The code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def F := ZMod 7`: Defines the field F to be the finite field with 7 elements, matching F = Z_7.
- `def p : Polynomial F := X ^ 3 - C (2 : F)`: Defines the polynomial p(x) = x^3 − 2 in F[x], with `C` coercing 2 into the coefficient ring F.
- `def q : Polynomial F := X ^ 3 + C (2 : F)`: Defines the polynomial q(x) = x^3 + 2 in F[x].
- `theorem p_irreducible : Irreducible (p : Polynomial F) := by sorry`: States that p is irreducible over F.
- `theorem q_irreducible : Irreducible (q : Polynomial F) := by sorry`: States that q is irreducible over F.
- `theorem quot_iso : (Polynomial F) ⧸ Ideal.span ({p} : Set (Polynomial F)) ≃+* (Polynomial F) ⧸ Ideal.span ({q} : Set (Polynomial F)) := by sorry`: States there is a ring isomorphism between the quotient rings F[X]/(p) and F[X]/(q), where `(p)` and `(q)` are the ideals generated by p and q, expressed as `Ideal.span {p}` and `Ideal.span {q}`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The code exactly defines the field F = Z_7 and the polynomials p(x) = x^3 − 2 and q(x) = x^3 + 2 in F[x].
- It asserts as separate theorems that both p and q are irreducible in F[x].
- It asserts that the quotient rings F[x]/(p) and F[x]/(q) are isomorphic as rings. Since over a field, quotients by ideals generated by irreducible polynomials are fields, a ring isomorphism between these quotients is also an isomorphism of fields; the comment even notes “in fact they are fields.” The irreducibility theorems, stated separately, supply the fact that these quotients are fields.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all constructs used are standard Mathlib notions. The proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Final comparison:
- Natural language asks to show: (1) p and q are irreducible in F[x], and (2) the fields F[x]/(p) and F[x]/(q) are isomorphic.
- The Lean code states (1) and (2) faithfully: irreducibility theorems and an isomorphism of the quotients. The slight technicality that the isomorphism is stated as a ring isomorphism is standard and sufficient, since both quotients are (by the separate irreducibility theorems) fields.
- No discrepancies in meaning were found.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `theorem isIdeal_ker_mul_left {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (a : R) :`: We fix a commutative ring R and an element a ∈ R.
- `Ideal.IsIdeal (setOf (λ x => x * a = 0)) := by sorry`: The statement asserts that the set {x ∈ R | x * a = 0} is an ideal of R (expressed via a predicate `Ideal.IsIdeal` on sets). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement defines L(a) = {x ∈ R | x a = 0} and asks to prove L(a) is an ideal. The Lean statement exactly mirrors this: in a commutative ring R, for a : R, the set {x | x * a = 0} satisfies the predicate “is an ideal.” The use of right-multiplication `x * a` matches the intended set, and commutativity ensures the usual ideal property is meaningful.
- While `Ideal.IsIdeal` is not the common Mathlib interface (usually one constructs an `Ideal R` or identifies this set as a kernel of a linear map), as a predicate meaning “this set is an ideal,” it is exactly the content of the statement. There are no auxiliary fake definitions; the content matches the mathematical claim.

3) Final comparison:
- Natural language: “If R is a commutative ring and a ∈ R, let L(a) = {x ∈ R | xa = 0}. Prove that L(a) is an ideal of R.”
- Lean: For commutative ring R and a ∈ R, the set {x | x * a = 0} is an ideal of R.
- These are the same statement. The only potential quibble is the specific predicate name `Ideal.IsIdeal`, which is nonstandard in Mathlib; however, as a logical translation of “this set is an ideal,” it is faithful to the mathematical statement.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement faithfully captures the natural language claim.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- The theorem statement:
  - `theorem add_pow_eq_add_pow_mod_char_pow {F : Type*} [Field F] (p : ℕ) [Fact (CharP F p)] (n : ℕ) (a b : F) : (a + b) ^ p ^ n = a ^ p ^ n + b ^ p ^ n := by sorry`
  - Natural language: For any field F, any natural number p such that F has characteristic p (expressed as an assumption `[Fact (CharP F p)]`), any natural number n, and any a, b in F, we have (a + b)^(p^n) = a^(p^n) + b^(p^n).
  - Note on parsing: In Lean, `a ^ p ^ n` is parsed as `a ^ (p ^ n)` (right-associative), so this matches the intended exponent m = p^n on each term.

Assessment against the original statement:
- Original: “If F is a field of characteristic p ≠ 0, show that (a + b)^m = a^m + b^m, where m = p^n, for all a, b ∈ F and any positive integer n.”
- The code’s hypotheses differ in two key ways:
  1) It does not assume `p ≠ 0`. It allows `p = 0` via `[Fact (CharP F 0)]` (i.e., characteristic 0). In characteristic 0 and for n > 0, the asserted equality would be false because m = 0^n = 0, giving (a+b)^0 = 1 while a^0 + b^0 = 1 + 1.
  2) It does not require `n > 0`. This is a harmless generalization (the identity still holds when n = 0), so this part is acceptable.
- The code also wraps `CharP F p` as a `Fact` rather than using the standard typeclass `[CharP F p]`. While unusual, this still states the assumption “char(F) = p” as a premise, so it does not by itself invalidate the translation.

Final comparison:
- The missing hypothesis `p ≠ 0` is essential. The code claims the result even when `p = 0`, which is not faithful to the original statement and is in fact false in that case. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  Natural language: For any types K and L equipped with field structures, and any ring homomorphism f from K to L (i.e., a unital ring hom, which in mathlib is `K →+* L`), the underlying function of f is injective. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: ""Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.""
The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: given fields K and L, every `RingHom` f: K → L is injective. In mathlib, a homomorphism of fields is formalized as a `RingHom` between `Field` instances, which matches standard usage of “field homomorphism” (unital ring homomorphism). The conclusion `Function.Injective f.to_fun` expresses that f is injective.

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues.
- Scope: Fields only (not division rings) — matches the natural language.
- Type of homomorphism: `RingHom`, i.e., unital ring hom between fields — standard for “homomorphism of fields”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The name `ring_hom.injective_of_fields` is just a label and does not affect content.
No discrepancies found; the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  • Variables: `a b : Int` means a and b are integers.
  • Hypothesis `h : (a : GaussianInt) ∣ (b : GaussianInt)` says: viewing a and b as Gaussian integers (via the canonical coercion Int → GaussianInt), a divides b in the ring of Gaussian integers (i.e., there exists a Gaussian integer c such that b = a * c in ℤ[i]).
  • Conclusion `a ∣ b` is divisibility in ℤ: there exists an integer k such that b = a * k in ℤ.

- This matches exactly the natural language statement: if a, b are integers and a divides b in the Gaussian integers, then a divides b in ℤ.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The concepts used (GaussianInt, divisibility, coercion from Int to GaussianInt) are standard in Mathlib.
- The formulation is parameterized over arbitrary integers a and b, which aligns with the universal nature of the natural language statement.

  Interpreted: For natural numbers p, q that are prime, and for any group G that is finite with |G| = p*q, there exists a normal subgroup N of G such that N is neither the whole group (⊤) nor the trivial subgroup (⊥). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: ""Prove that no group of order p q, where p and q are prime, is simple."" A group is simple iff it has no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. The Lean theorem asserts existence of a normal subgroup N with N ≠ ⊤ and N ≠ ⊥ for any group G with |G| = p*q and p, q prime. This is exactly the negation of simplicity for G. The use of `NormalSubgroup G` bundles normality, and `N ≠ ⊤` and `N ≠ ⊥` express properness and nontriviality. The assumptions `[Fintype G]` and `Fintype.card G = p*q` encode ""order p q"". There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.
- The statement does not assume p ≠ q; the natural language also does not explicitly require distinct primes, and the result remains true if p = q (order p^2). So the formalization is at least as strong as the usual statement and still faithful.

3) Final check: The math problems are the same. The Lean statement is logically equivalent to ""G is not simple"" under the given hypotheses. No discrepancies found.

  This states: Let F be a field and suppose F has characteristic p (with p ≠ 0). Fix n : ℕ. For every a ∈ F, if a is a root of the polynomial f(X) = X^(p^n) − X over F, then the derivative f'(X) evaluated at a is nonzero.
  Equivalently, every root a ∈ F of X^(p^n) − X is simple (has multiplicity 1), since a necessary and sufficient condition for a root to be multiple is that f'(a) = 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “If F is of characteristic p ≠ 0, show that all the roots of x^m − x, where m = p^n, are distinct.”
- In polynomial terms, “all the roots are distinct” means the polynomial has no multiple roots (is squarefree). A standard criterion is: for any root a (in any extension), f'(a) ≠ 0. The Lean statement says: for any a ∈ F with f(a) = 0, f'(a) ≠ 0. This captures the “no repeated roots” property at least for roots lying in F. In this specific situation, f'(X) = (p^n)X^(p^n − 1) − 1, and in characteristic p ≠ 0 we have (p^n) = 0 in F, so f'(X) = −1, a constant nonzero polynomial. Hence the conclusion actually holds for any root in any extension as well. Although the theorem quantifies only over a : F, it expresses the intended distinctness via the derivative criterion; it is a standard and faithful formalization of the statement in this context.
- The code makes no vacuous or placeholder definitions; it simply states the theorem with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable under the audit’s criterion of focusing on the statement.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Hypotheses: Field of characteristic p with p ≠ 0, m = p^n, match the natural statement.
- Conclusion: “each root has nonzero derivative” is the formal equivalent of “all roots are distinct.” The only minor nuance is that the Lean quantifies roots in F, not in an arbitrary extension, but given f'(X) = −1 under the hypotheses, the distinction is immaterial; moreover, the original statement did not explicitly demand a universal quantification over extensions. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

The `sorry` is just a placeholder for the proof and does not alter the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- The Lean condition `p % 4 = 3` expresses exactly that p ≡ 3 (mod 4) for natural numbers (since `Nat.ModEq 4 p 3` is equivalent to `p % 4 = 3` and 3 < 4). Thus this matches ""congruent to -1 modulo 4"".

- The theorem states: infinitely many primes p with p ≡ 3 (mod 4). This is exactly ""infinitely many primes congruent to −1 mod 4."" No change in meaning, no specialization/generalization beyond intent.
- Using `%` instead of an explicit congruence relation is a standard equivalent formulation in Nat.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Artin_exercise_3_7_2 {F : Type*} [Field F] {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V] (infF : Infinite F) :` sets up F as a field, V as a vector space over F (since V has an additive commutative group structure and a Module F V structure), and assumes F is infinite.
- `∀ (s : Finset (Submodule F V)),` considers any finite set s of subspaces of V.
- `(∀ W (h : W ∈ s), W ≠ (⊤ : Submodule F V)) →` assumes every subspace W in s is proper (i.e., not equal to ⊤ = V).
- `∃ v : V, ∀ W (h : W ∈ s), v ∉ W` concludes that there exists a vector v in V which is not contained in any of the subspaces in s. Equivalently, v is not in the union of the members of s.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but this does not affect the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: Over an infinite field F, a vector space V is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces. The Lean statement says: For any finite family (finset) of proper subspaces of V, there exists a vector not in any of them. This is exactly equivalent to the union of those subspaces being a proper subset of V, i.e., not equal to V. Thus it faithfully matches the natural language claim.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Quantification over finite unions is expressed via `Finset (Submodule F V)`—this is the standard formalization of “finitely many subspaces”.
- “Proper subspaces” is expressed as `W ≠ ⊤`, which is correct.
- The conclusion uses an explicit witness v outside all members, which is equivalent to the union not covering V.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; this is a direct theorem statement using Mathlib structures.
Hence, the formal statement is the same as the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def star (a b : Int) : Int := a - b` defines a binary operation `star` on the integers ℤ by `a ⋆ b = a - b`. This matches the natural language definition exactly.
- `notation:65 a "" ⋆ "" b => star a b` introduces the infix notation ⋆ for this operation, as described.
- `theorem star_not_comm : ∃ a b : Int, (a ⋆ b) ≠ (b ⋆ a) := by sorry` states that there exist integers a and b such that `a ⋆ b ≠ b ⋆ a`. This is the standard way to express that the operation is not commutative (it provides a counterexample). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for assessing translation fidelity.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to define ⋆ on ℤ by `a ⋆ b = a - b` and state that it is not commutative. The code does precisely this: it defines the operation on `Int` (which is ℤ in Lean) by subtraction, and states non-commutativity via existence of a counterexample.
- There are no extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only auxiliary item is the notation, which faithfully reflects the intended symbol.
- The non-commutativity is expressed as `∃ a b, a ⋆ b ≠ b ⋆ a`, which is a standard and even stronger statement than just `¬ ∀ a b, a ⋆ b = b ⋆ a`, and aligns with how one would “prove not commutative” by counterexample.

Final check:
- The mathematical content of the code matches the natural language statement exactly. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, including the definition and algebraic structure of `ZMod n` (integers modulo n) and multiplication on it.
- Docstring: States the goal: multiplication in Z/nZ is associative.
- `theorem mul_assoc_Zmod (n : ℕ) : ∀ a b c : ZMod n, a * b * c = a * (b * c) := by sorry`: For any natural number `n`, and any `a b c` in `ZMod n`, we have `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`. In Lean, `a * b * c` parses as `(a * b) * c`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove that multiplication on the residue class ring Z/nZ is associative. The Lean statement exactly formalizes this as associativity of `*` on `ZMod n`, for arbitrary `n` and arbitrary `a, b, c`. There are no extraneous hypotheses or weakened claims.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement includes the case `n = 0` (`ZMod 0`), which is a standard convention in Mathlib and still yields an associative multiplication. This is at most a slight generalization and does not conflict with the original statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the standard Mathlib `ZMod` and its multiplication are used.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the statement.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: Set up the Mathlib environment and open polynomial notation (so `X` denotes the polynomial variable).
- Comment explains the exercise: show that x^3 − 9 is irreducible over F_{31}.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_6c : Irreducible (X ^ 3 - 9 : Polynomial (ZMod 31)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Over the polynomial ring with coefficients in `ZMod 31` (which is the finite field F_{31} since 31 is prime), the polynomial `X^3 - 9` is irreducible. Here `9` is coerced into `ZMod 31`, and `Irreducible` is the standard Mathlib predicate for irreducibility of polynomials.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language says: “Prove that x^3 − 9 is irreducible in F_{31}.” Interpreted as: the polynomial x^3 − 9 in F_{31}[x] is irreducible.
- The Lean statement precisely asserts `Irreducible (X ^ 3 - 9 : Polynomial (ZMod 31))`, i.e., irreducible in (ZMod 31)[X] = F_{31}[X]. This matches exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem body uses `sorry`, but the task evaluates translation, not proof. The statement itself matches exactly.
- No generalization/specialization mismatch: same field, same polynomial, same property.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: We are working in an arbitrary group G.
- `variable {x : G} {n : ℕ}`: We fix an element x in G and a natural number n.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_17` has hypotheses:
  • `h_pow : x ^ n = 1`: x to the n-th power equals the identity.
  • `h_min : ∀ m, m < n → x ^ m ≠ 1`: For every natural m with m < n, x^m is not the identity; i.e., n is the least positive exponent with x^n = 1.
  • `hn : 0 < n`: n is positive.
  Conclusion: `x⁻¹ = x ^ (n - 1)`: the inverse of x equals x to the (n − 1)-th power.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language assertion states: If |x| = n for some positive integer n, then x^{-1} = x^{n-1}. In group theory, “|x| = n” means n is the least positive integer with x^n = 1. The Lean hypotheses `h_pow`, `h_min`, and `hn` exactly formalize this: x^n = 1, no smaller positive exponent gives 1, and n > 0. The conclusion matches exactly: x^{-1} = x^(n-1). No extraneous assumptions (like commutativity) are added; a general Group suffices. Using ℕ subtraction `n - 1` is appropriate since `hn : 0 < n` ensures it represents the predecessor.

3) Final check of equivalence:
The Lean statement is precisely the formalization of the given statement. It neither weakens nor strengthens it and uses a standard equivalent characterization of “order n.” No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The use of `sorry` for the proof does not affect faithfulness of the statement being formalized.

- `open Finset`: Opens the `Finset` namespace; not used in the statement and irrelevant, but harmless.
- The theorem `same_order_inv {G : Type*} [Group G] (x : G) : orderOf x = orderOf x⁻¹` states: For any type `G` with a group structure, and any element `x : G`, the order of `x` equals the order of its inverse `x⁻¹`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks: “For x an element in G show that x and x^{-1} have the same order.” The Lean theorem precisely asserts equality of `orderOf x` and `orderOf x⁻¹` for any group `G` and element `x`. In Mathlib, `orderOf` is the standard group-theoretic order (with value 0 representing infinite order), so equality here captures exactly that they have the same (finite or infinite) order.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope: The Lean statement is fully general over any group `G`, matching the natural language.
- Definition of order: Mathlib’s `orderOf` uses `Nat` with `0` representing infinite order; this is a standard formalization and faithfully represents “same order,” including the infinite case. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of `sorry` only indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is correct and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language claim.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def gaussian_int : Type := (Polynomial Int) ⧸ Ideal.span ({Polynomial.X ^ 2 + 1} : Set (Polynomial Int))`
  This defines the type called `gaussian_int` to be the quotient ring ℤ[X] modulo the ideal generated by X^2 + 1, i.e. ℤ[X]/(X^2+1). This is a standard presentation of the Gaussian integers ℤ[i].

- `theorem Artin_exercise_10_6_7 (I : Ideal gaussian_int) (h : I ≠ ⊥) : ∃ n : Int, (n : gaussian_int) ∈ I ∧ n ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  This states: For any ideal `I` of the ring `gaussian_int`, if `I` is not the zero ideal (`I ≠ ⊥`), then there exists an integer `n` such that the image of `n` in `gaussian_int` (via the canonical ring hom ℤ → gaussian_int) lies in `I`, and moreover `n ≠ 0` as an integer.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: ""Prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer."" The Lean theorem exactly asserts that for any nonzero ideal of the Gaussian integers, there exists a nonzero integer whose embedded image lies in that ideal. The use of the presentation ℤ[X]/(X^2+1) is a standard model of ℤ[i], so it correctly captures the ring of Gaussian integers. The condition `n ≠ 0` is expressed as an integer inequality, matching the phrase ""nonzero integer."" Membership `(n : gaussian_int) ∈ I` is exactly the ideal containing that embedded integer. Everything aligns with the intended meaning.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses a specific construction of ℤ[i] as a quotient; this is isomorphic to the usual Gaussian integers and is an acceptable faithful choice.
- The nonzeroness is required of `n` in ℤ; in ℤ[i] this corresponds to a nonzero element because the characteristic is zero, so there is no mismatch.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the only auxiliary is the legitimate definition of `gaussian_int`.
Therefore, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_6_11 (A B : Type*) [Group A] [Group B] : A × B ≃* B × A := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem parameterized by two types `A` and `B`, each equipped with a group structure (`[Group A] [Group B]`). The conclusion `A × B ≃* B × A` states there exists a group isomorphism (a multiplicative equivalence) between the product group `A × B` and the product group `B × A`. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but for auditing purposes, we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Let A and B be groups. Prove that A × B ≅ B × A."" In Lean, `A × B` is the product type endowed with the componentwise group structure given `[Group A] [Group B]`. The notation `≃*` denotes a group isomorphism (multiplicative equivalence). Thus, the Lean statement precisely captures the assertion that the direct product groups `A × B` and `B × A` are isomorphic.

3) Final check for differences:
- There are no extraneous hypotheses or missing conditions. The concept of group isomorphism matches `≃*`. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is neither a generalization nor a specialization beyond the intended claim. It is exactly the same mathematical statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_15 {G : Type*} [Group G] (l : List G) : (l.prod)⁻¹ = (l.reverse.map (·⁻¹)).prod := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any group G and any finite list l of elements of G, the inverse of the product of the list equals the product of the inverses of the elements taken in reverse order. Here, `l.prod` is the product a₁ * a₂ * ... * aₙ, `l.reverse` reverses the list to [aₙ, ..., a₁], `map (·⁻¹)` applies inversion to each element yielding [aₙ⁻¹, ..., a₁⁻¹], and then `.prod` multiplies them to get aₙ⁻¹ * ... * a₁⁻¹. The statement uses only standard Mathlib notions; there are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement is: Prove that (a₁ a₂ ... aₙ)⁻¹ = aₙ⁻¹ aₙ₋₁⁻¹ ... a₁⁻¹ for all aᵢ ∈ G. The Lean theorem asserts exactly this, phrased for an arbitrary finite list of elements in a group. The list formulation is a standard and faithful encoding of the statement. It even naturally includes the n = 0 case (empty product), which is a harmless and standard generalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement covers all finite sequences via lists, matching the natural language for arbitrary n.
- It slightly generalizes to the empty list case, which remains consistent with the group identity case.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the only omission is the proof (marked `sorry`), which is allowed under the instructions.
Thus, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

The natural language claim says: Deduce that |ab| = |ba| for all a, b in G. In group theory, |x| denotes the order of the element x.

There are no extra hypotheses, and the quantification over all a, b ∈ G is present.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. Minor technical note: in Mathlib, `orderOf` returns a `Nat` with 0 representing infinite order; equality still correctly captures equality of (possibly infinite) orders. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. Therefore, the translation is legitimate and faithful.

- `theorem ideal_mul_eq_inf_of_add_eq_top (h : I + J = ⊤) : I * J = I ⊓ J := by sorry`:
  - Hypothesis `h : I + J = ⊤` means the sum of ideals I and J is the top ideal, i.e., equals the whole ring R. In Mathlib, for ideals, `I + J` is the sum of ideals (which coincides with their join/sup).
  - Conclusion `I * J = I ⊓ J` says the product of ideals equals their infimum. For ideals, `⊓` is the infimum which is the set-theoretic intersection. So this states `IJ = I ∩ J`.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let I, J be ideals of a ring R such that I + J = R. Prove that IJ = I ∩ J.
- The Lean statement precisely matches: under `I + J = ⊤` (i.e., equals R), we get `I * J = I ⊓ J` (i.e., product equals intersection).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib’s standard notions of ideals, their sum, product, and infimum.

Final check for differences:
- The only potential discrepancy is that Lean assumes `[CommRing R]` (commutative ring), while the natural language says “ring R” (which can be ambiguous in conventions). In many contexts, “ring” means commutative ring; moreover, the equality IJ = I ∩ J under I+J=R is standard in commutative rings, and can fail in the noncommutative setting. Thus the Lean assumption is appropriate and not a problematic specialization. This is acceptable under the guidelines.
- Otherwise, the statements are the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- Conclusion matches: G is abelian, expressed as ∀ a b, a * b = b * a.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_13_6_10 (K : Type*) [Field K] [Fintype K] : (∏ x : K in (Finset.univ.erase (0 : K)), x) = -1 := by sorry`
  • This declares a theorem for an arbitrary type `K` with a field structure `[Field K]` and finitely many elements `[Fintype K]`, i.e., a finite field.  
  • `Finset.univ` is the finite set of all elements of `K`.  
  • `erase (0 : K)` removes the element `0` from this set.  
  • `(∏ x : K in ..., x)` denotes the product over that finite set of the function `x ↦ x`, i.e., the product of all elements in that set.  
  • The equality asserts that this product equals `-1` in the field `K`.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
The natural language claim is: ""Let K be a finite field. Prove that the product of the nonzero elements of K is -1."" The Lean statement asserts exactly that: for a finite field `K`, the product over all elements except `0` is `-1`. There are no extra or missing hypotheses: `[Field K]` and `[Fintype K]` precisely mean ""finite field."" The product is taken over all nonzero elements via `Finset.univ.erase 0`. The right-hand side is `-1` in `K`. This matches the statement, including the characteristic-2 edge case where `-1 = 1` and the identity still holds.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- Docstring: Restates the problem precisely: H is an additive subgroup of Q with the property that for every nonzero x in H, 1/x is in H; conclude H is either {0} or all of Q.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_2_1_13 (H : AddSubgroup (Rat)) (h : ∀ x, x ∈ H → x ≠ 0 → x⁻¹ ∈ H) : H = (⊥ : AddSubgroup (Rat)) ∨ H = (⊤ : AddSubgroup (Rat)) := by sorry`
  This states: For an additive subgroup H of the rationals, if for all x with x ∈ H and x ≠ 0 we have x⁻¹ ∈ H, then H equals the bottom additive subgroup (the trivial subgroup {0}) or the top additive subgroup (the whole of ℚ). The notation x⁻¹ is the multiplicative inverse, i.e., 1/x. In Lean, ⊥ and ⊤ for AddSubgroup ℚ denote {0} and ℚ respectively.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean hypothesis exactly matches “1/x ∈ H for every nonzero x ∈ H,” using multiplicative inverse x⁻¹ and a nonzero condition x ≠ 0.
- H is an AddSubgroup of ℚ, matching “subgroup of the additive group of rational numbers.”
- The conclusion H = 0 or H = ℚ is expressed as H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤ for AddSubgroup ℚ.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly encodes the natural language claim. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task since we are only checking the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

3) Final comparison:
- The formal theorem and the natural language statement are the same mathematically. No scope changes, no extra assumptions, no missing conditions. Notational differences (1/x vs x⁻¹, 0/Q vs ⊥/⊤) are equivalent in this context.

Hence, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{G : Type*} [Group G]`: Let G be a type equipped with a group structure.
  - `{H K : Subgroup G}`: H and K are subgroups of G.
  - `[Fintype H] [Fintype K]`: H and K are finite (as types of subgroup elements), i.e., the subgroups are finite.
  - `(coprime : Nat.Coprime (Fintype.card H) (Fintype.card K))`: The orders (cardinalities) of H and K are relatively prime.
  - Conclusion: `(H ⊓ K) = ⊥`: The meet (infimum) of H and K in the lattice of subgroups equals the bottom subgroup, i.e., the trivial subgroup {1}. Here `⊓` corresponds to intersection of subgroups, and `⊥` is the trivial subgroup.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If H and K are finite subgroups of G with relatively prime orders, then H ∩ K = 1 (the trivial subgroup).
- The Lean statement matches exactly:
  - Finite subgroups: encoded by `[Fintype H] [Fintype K]`.
  - Orders are relatively prime: `Nat.Coprime (Fintype.card H) (Fintype.card K)`.
  - Intersection is trivial: `(H ⊓ K) = ⊥` is the standard formalization of `H ∩ K = 1`.
- No extraneous assumptions (e.g., commutativity) are added; this matches the general group case.

3) Final check for differences:
- ""H ∩ K = 1"" in traditional notation corresponds to the trivial subgroup; Lean uses `(H ⊓ K) = ⊥`. This is a notational change only, not a change in meaning.
- The code introduces no vacuous or auxiliary definitions; it's a direct theorem statement without placeholders.
- Therefore, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- Comment block cites the exercise statement about finite abelian groups having subgroups of each divisor order.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] [CommGroup G]`: Fixes a type G with a group structure, which is abelian (`CommGroup G`) and finite (`Fintype G`). The `[Group G]` is redundant because `[CommGroup G]` implies it, but it does not change the meaning.
- `theorem finite_abelian_group_has_subgroup_of_order (n : ℕ) (h : n ∣ Fintype.card G) : ∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = n := by sorry`: States that for any natural number n dividing the order of G (cardinality of G), there exists a subgroup H of G with cardinality n. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable here since we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement: For a finite abelian group G, for each positive divisor n of |G|, there exists a subgroup of order n. The Lean statement assumes G is finite and abelian and asserts existence of a subgroup of cardinality n for any n with `n ∣ Fintype.card G`.
- The “positive” condition on n is implicit in `n ∣ Fintype.card G` for natural numbers, since `0 ∣ m` is false when `m ≠ 0`, and `|G| ≥ 1` for a group. Thus the Lean hypothesis excludes n = 0 automatically.
- The conclusion “there exists a subgroup of order n” matches `∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = n` exactly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is provided.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given statement (method of proof—Cauchy + induction—is not part of the proposition and need not be encoded). No meaningful discrepancy: scope (finite abelian G), hypothesis (n divides |G|), and conclusion (exists subgroup of order n) all match.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Pointwise`: Imports Mathlib; opening `Pointwise` is irrelevant here.
- `theorem comm_of_prod_comm {A B : Type*} [Group A] [Group B] : CommGroup (A × B) ↔ CommGroup A ∧ CommGroup B := by sorry`
  Natural language reading: Under given group structures on A and B, the statement claims a logical equivalence (↔) between “CommGroup (A × B)” and “CommGroup A ∧ CommGroup B”. In Lean, `CommGroup α` is a typeclass (a structure), not a proposition. Thus `↔` does not even have the right type to compare these; it compares `Prop`s, not structures. Even if we try to read it informally, it is asserting something like “there is a commutative group structure on A × B if and only if there are commutative group structures on A and B,” but expressed using the wrong connective and objects (structures rather than Prop-level predicates).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “A × B is an abelian group if and only if both A and B are abelian,” given that A and B already have group structures. In Lean, this should be formalized as a Prop-level claim about the existing product group being commutative, e.g.
  - `(∀ x y : A × B, x * y = y * x) ↔ ((∀ a a' : A, a * a' = a' * a) ∧ (∀ b b' : B, b * b' = b' * b))`, or
  - `[Group A] [Group B]` together with a Prop-class such as `IsCommutative A (·*·)` and correspondingly for `A × B`.
- The provided code uses `CommGroup` structures directly in an ↔, which is ill-typed and not a faithful rendering of the intended property. It mixes up structures (data) with propositions (properties). It also does not mention the canonical product group structure; instead it suggests an existence/equivalence of structures, and even that is expressed incorrectly via ↔ rather than a type equivalence.

Final check:
- The Lean statement is not a legitimate, faithful translation: it is ill-typed in Lean (so would not compile), and conceptually it does not correctly express the property “is abelian” about the existing group structure. No auxiliary vacuous definitions exist, but the main statement is incorrect as a translation.

Grade rationale:
- Related to the intended mathematics but uses the wrong kind of object (typeclass structures) with ↔, which is a significant mismatch. No vacuous placeholders, but the statement is not faithful. Hence a low score.

    H < ⊤ → ∃ M : Subgroup G, M.IsMaximal ∧ H ≤ M := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line into natural language.
- `theorem exists_max_subgroup_of_proper_subgroup (G : Type*) [Group G] [Finite G] (H : Subgroup G) :` means: Let G be a type equipped with a group structure and assume G is finite (its underlying type is finite). Let H be a subgroup of G.
- `H < ⊤ →` means: If H is strictly less than the top subgroup (i.e., H is a proper subgroup of G, H ≠ G).
- `∃ M : Subgroup G, M.IsMaximal ∧ H ≤ M` means: There exists a subgroup M of G such that M is maximal (in the lattice of subgroups of G) and H is contained in M (i.e., H ≤ M).

Here, `⊤` denotes the whole group G seen as a subgroup; `H < ⊤` is equivalent to “H is a proper subgroup of G.” The predicate `M.IsMaximal` in the order/lattice sense for subgroups matches the natural definition: M ≠ G and any subgroup containing M is either M or G.

Step 2: Assess whether the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The original statement defines a maximal subgroup and asks to prove: if H is a proper subgroup of a finite group G then there exists a maximal subgroup of G containing H. The Lean statement exactly asserts: given a finite group G and a proper subgroup H (H < ⊤), there exists a subgroup M that is maximal (M.IsMaximal) and contains H (H ≤ M). This matches the natural language claim.

Step 3: Final check and comparison.
- Finite group: The code assumes `[Finite G]`, which matches “finite group.”
- Proper subgroup: The hypothesis `H < ⊤` is equivalent to “H ≠ G.”
- Existence of maximal subgroup containing H: The conclusion `∃ M, M.IsMaximal ∧ H ≤ M` states exactly that.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem uses standard Mathlib notions (`Subgroup`, `IsMaximal`, lattice order on subgroups).

No discrepancies were found. The translation is faithful and precise.

- `theorem infinite_symmetric_group_on_omega : Infinite (Equiv.Perm (Set.Ici 1)) := by sorry`: States that the type of permutations (i.e., the symmetric group) on the set `{n : ℕ | 1 ≤ n}` is infinite. `Equiv.Perm α` denotes the symmetric group on α; `Infinite` asserts that the underlying set is infinite.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement: ""Prove that if Ω = {1,2,3, ...} then S_Ω is an infinite group.""
- Ω is modeled as `{n : ℕ | 1 ≤ n}` which is exactly {1,2,3,...}. 
- `S_Ω` corresponds to `Equiv.Perm Ω`, the symmetric group on Ω.
- The Lean theorem asserts `Infinite (Equiv.Perm Ω)`, i.e., the symmetric group has infinitely many elements. The group structure itself is standard and built into `Equiv.Perm` in Mathlib, so the statement does not need to restate ""is a group""; it focuses on the infinitude property, which is the substantive claim.

3) Final check:
- The Lean statement specifies Ω = {1,2,3,...} via `Set.Ici 1` and asserts that the symmetric group on Ω is infinite. This matches the mathematical meaning of the natural statement. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement. The slight difference that the code doesn’t explicitly restate ""is a group"" is acceptable since `Equiv.Perm` is known to be a group in Mathlib.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_19 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 6545) : ¬SimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G with a group structure and a finite cardinality, if the cardinality (order) of G is 6545, then G is not a simple group.
  Here, `SimpleGroup G` is Mathlib's standard predicate meaning G is simple (nontrivial with no nontrivial normal subgroups), so `¬SimpleGroup G` means G is not simple. The hypothesis `[Fintype G]` ensures finiteness, and `Fintype.card G = 6545` encodes |G| = 6545.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement says: ""Prove that if |G|=6545 then G is not simple."" The Lean theorem universally quantifies over all groups G, assumes finiteness via `[Fintype G]` (which is implicit in having a finite order), and the order equals 6545, and concludes G is not simple. This matches exactly.

3) Final check: The two problems are the same.
- Quantification: Universal over groups G — matches the intended generality.
- Assumptions: Finite group with order 6545 — captured by `[Fintype G]` and `Fintype.card G = 6545`.
- Conclusion: Not simple — `¬SimpleGroup G`.
No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code is a straightforward statement. Minor technical explicitness (the `[Fintype G]` assumption) is appropriate and faithful.

- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but for this task we only assess the statement/translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “If G is an abelian group of order pq, with p and q distinct primes, then G is cyclic.”
- The Lean theorem assumes G is a finite abelian group (AddCommGroup + Fintype), with |G| = p*q, where p, q are distinct primes, and concludes that G is cyclic. The conclusion is expressed via the existence of a generator: the closure of a singleton equals the top subgroup, which is the standard formalization of cyclic in additive notation.
- This matches the original statement exactly (modulo additive vs multiplicative notation, which is standard and immaterial).

3) Final check for differences:
- Additive vs multiplicative notation: acceptable and equivalent.
- Use of “closure of {g} = ⊤” instead of a named predicate like IsCyclic: equivalent characterization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; uses standard Mathlib structures; statement is precise.
- All hypotheses (abelian, finite, order pq, distinct primes) are present.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_13 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 56) : ...` 
  This states: Let G be a finite group with |G| = 56.
- `∃ (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (P : Subgroup G), ...` 
  There exists a natural number p which is prime, and a subgroup P of G, such that...
- `p ∣ (56 : ℕ)`
  p divides 56 (i.e., p divides the order of G by the hypothesis h).
- `P.IsSylow p`
  P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
- `P.Normal`
  P is normal in G.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: “Prove that a group of order 56 has a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order.”
- The Lean statement precisely asserts the existence of a prime p dividing 56 and a subgroup P of G that is both a Sylow p-subgroup and normal. Given the hypothesis |G| = 56, “p ∣ 56” matches “p divides its order.”
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the code only states a theorem with a `sorry` proof stub, which is acceptable for translation auditing. It uses standard Mathlib notions such as `Subgroup`, `IsSylow`, and `Normal`.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically: existence of a prime divisor p of |G| and a normal Sylow p-subgroup.
- No discrepancies or unintended generalizations/specializations are present.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We are working in a group `G`.
- Theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_3_3` takes:
  - `H : Subgroup G`: a subgroup `H` of `G`.
  - `{p : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p)`: a natural number `p` which is prime.
  - `(Hnormal : H.normal)`: `H` is a normal subgroup of `G`.
  - `(hindex : Fintype.card (QuotientGroup.quotient H) = p)`: the quotient `G ⧸ H` has cardinality `p`, i.e., the index of `H` in `G` is `p`.
- Conclusion: For every subgroup `K : Subgroup G`, either
  - `(K ≤ H)`: `K` is contained in `H`, or
  - `((H : Set G) * (K : Set G) = Set.univ) ∧ Fintype.card (QuotientGroup.quotient (K ⊓ H)) = p`:
    - `(H : Set G) * (K : Set G) = Set.univ` means the setwise product `HK` equals all of `G` (i.e., `G = HK`).
    - `Fintype.card (QuotientGroup.quotient (K ⊓ H)) = p` means the quotient of `G` by `K ∩ H` has cardinality `p`.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses match: `H` is normal in `G` and has prime index `p`.
- Quantification over all subgroups `K ≤ G` is represented by `∀ (K : Subgroup G)`.
- The disjunction: either `K ≤ H` or `G = HK` matches the intended structure; expressing `G = HK` via `HK = univ` as sets is faithful.
- Critical discrepancy: The statement requires `|K : K ∩ H| = p`, i.e., the index of `K ∩ H` in `K` is `p` (equivalently, the cardinality of the quotient `K/(K ∩ H)` is `p`). The Lean code instead asserts `Fintype.card (QuotientGroup.quotient (K ⊓ H)) = p`, which is the cardinality of `G/(K ∩ H)`, i.e., the index of `K ∩ H` in `G`. These are not the same in general. The correct formalization for `|K : K ∩ H| = p` would involve the quotient of `K` by `K ⊓ H` (e.g., using the subgroup `K.subtype` or an explicit quotient in `K`), not the quotient of `G`.

No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced, and the use of `Fintype.card (QuotientGroup.quotient H) = p` is a standard way to express index `p`. However, the key target quantity `|K : K ∩ H|` is mistranslated as `|G : K ∩ H|`.

Final check: The math problems are different due to this mismatch. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib; no mathematical content.
- Comment explains an example (Klein four group) but does not affect the formal statement.
- Theorem `exists_normal_not_characteristic : ∃ (G : Type*) [Group G], ∃ (H : Subgroup G), IsNormal H ∧ ¬IsCharacteristic H`:
  This asserts the existence of a type G with a group structure, and a subgroup H of G, such that H is normal (`IsNormal H`) and H is not characteristic (`¬IsCharacteristic H`). There are no placeholders or auxiliary definitions; it’s a direct existential statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that there exists a normal subgroup that is not characteristic.” The Lean theorem states exactly that: there exists a group and a subgroup which is normal but not characteristic. It does not add extra hypotheses or change quantifiers; it is the same existence claim.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. No discrepancies: both assert mere existence of a counterexample (a normal subgroup that fails to be characteristic). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is to check the translation; there are no vacuous or misleading auxiliary definitions. The code compiles by assumption, so `IsNormal` and `IsCharacteristic` are legitimate Mathlib predicates on subgroups. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_2_9a {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] {p : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) {α : ℕ} (hcard : Fintype.card G = p ^ α) (H : Subgroup G) (hindex : Fintype.card (G ⧸ H) = p) : H.normal := by sorry`
  This states: Let G be a finite group (Group G and Fintype G). Let p be a natural number that is prime (hp). Let α be a natural number, and suppose |G| = p^α (hcard). Let H be a subgroup of G. If the number of left cosets of H in G (i.e., the cardinality of the quotient type G ⧸ H) equals p (hindex), then H is normal in G (H.normal).

- Using `G ⧸ H` is the type of left cosets even if H is not assumed normal, so `Fintype.card (G ⧸ H)` represents the index of H in G in the finite case. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “If p is a prime and G is a group of order p^α for some α ∈ ℤ^+, then every subgroup of index p is normal in G.”
- Lean: Assumes p is prime, |G| = p^α, and for any subgroup H with index p (encoded as `Fintype.card (G ⧸ H) = p`), concludes H is normal. This is exactly the universal statement “every subgroup of index p is normal.”

3) Differences and their significance:
- The natural language specifies α ∈ ℤ^+ (positive integer), whereas Lean uses `α : ℕ` (allowing α = 0). This is a very mild generalization. If α = 0, then |G| = 1 and there are no subgroups of index p ≥ 2, so the universal statement remains vacuously true. The core content is unchanged.
- The statement uses ℕ for p as a prime number, which matches the usual treatment of primes in Lean and is faithful to the intent.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used to encode the mathematical notions; the theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully captures the original statement (with the harmless generalization α ≥ 0 instead of α ≥ 1).

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_15 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 351) :` sets up G as a finite group with |G| = 351.
- Conclusion: `∃ (p : ℕ) (P : Subgroup G), Nat.Prime p ∧ p ∣ 351 ∧ IsSylow p P ∧ IsNormal P` asserts there exists a natural number p and a subgroup P of G such that p is prime, p divides 351, P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and P is normal in G.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; all predicates (Group, Fintype, Nat.Prime, IsSylow, IsNormal) are standard Mathlib notions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural language statement says: If a group has order 351, then it has a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order. The Lean statement exactly asserts the existence of a prime p dividing 351 and a Sylow p-subgroup P that is normal. This is a direct and faithful formalization.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The hypothesis |G| = 351 matches ""order 351"".
- The existence of p with `Nat.Prime p ∧ p ∣ 351` matches ""for some prime p dividing its order"".
- The existence of P with `IsSylow p P ∧ IsNormal P` matches ""has a normal Sylow p-subgroup"".

The original statement says: ""Prove that if u is a unit in R then so is −u."" The Lean statement precisely captures this: it assumes R is a ring (so that negation is defined) and asserts IsUnit (-u) from IsUnit u. This is exactly the intended content.

Exercise (Dummit & Foote 4.5.21, translated):
If |G| = 2907 then G is not simple.

Sketch of the intended proof (not formalized here): 2907 = 3^2 * 17 * 19.
By Sylow theory, the number n_17 of Sylow 17-subgroups divides 9*19 = 171 and is congruent to 1 mod 17, hence n_17 ∈ {1,171}.
Similarly n_19 ∈ {1,153}.
If both were greater than 1 one gets at least 171*16 + 153*18 = 5490 nonidentity elements, a contradiction.
Thus at least one of the Sylow 17- or 19-subgroups is unique and hence normal, so G is not simple.

  Given a finite group G with |G| = 2907, the statement claims the existence of a subgroup N of G such that:

  The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; we are only auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: If |G| = 2907 then G is not simple. A group is not simple iff it has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. The Lean statement asserts exactly the existence of such a subgroup N: it is normal (via closure under conjugation) and neither ⊥ nor ⊤. Thus the Lean theorem precisely formalizes “G is not simple.”

3) Final check for differences:
- The hypothesis |G| = 2907 matches `(h : Fintype.card G = 2907)`.
- “G is not simple” is formalized as existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, which matches standard definitions. The normality condition is expressed via conjugation closure, which is equivalent to normality for subgroups.

There are no discrepancies.

  - For an arbitrary type G equipped with a group structure and a fintype instance (so G is finite), and with the hypothesis that the cardinality of G is 462, the conclusion asserts the existence of a subgroup H of G that is normal (`IsNormal H`) and is neither the trivial subgroup (`H ≠ ⊥`) nor the whole group (`H ≠ ⊤`). This is exactly the existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.

2. Faithfulness to the original statement:

- `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; for this task we only assess the statement/translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asks: If |G| = 105, then G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 7-subgroup. The Lean statement matches this exactly: the hypothesis `Nat.card G = 105` corresponds to |G| = 105; the conclusions are existence of P in `sylow 5 G` and `sylow 7 G`, each satisfying `P.Normal`.
- The extra typeclass assumptions `[Fact (Nat.Prime 5)] [Fact (Nat.Prime 7)]` simply register 5 and 7 as primes; they align with the context and are not additional mathematical assumptions beyond what is implicit in the notion of Sylow p-subgroups.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is directly stated in standard Mathlib terms.
- The conjunction `(…) ∧ ( … )` corresponds to “and” in the original statement.
- Using `Nat.card` is a standard way in Mathlib to express the (finite) cardinality of a type and is equivalent to |G| = 105 in the intended context.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean into natural language.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: Let G be a group.
- `def IsCharacteristic (H K : Subgroup G) : Prop := H ≤ K ∧ ∀ (e : (↥K) ≃* (↥K)) (x : ↥K), ((e x : G) ∈ (H : Set G)) ↔ ((x : G) ∈ (H : Set G))`:
  This defines “H is characteristic in K” to mean two things: (i) H ≤ K, and (ii) for every group automorphism e of K and every x ∈ K, x ∈ H if and only if e(x) ∈ H. Equivalently, every automorphism of K preserves H setwise, i.e., e(H) = H for all automorphisms e of K. This matches the usual definition of “characteristic in K”.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_4_8a {H K : Subgroup G} (hHK : H ≤ K) (hchar : IsCharacteristic H K) (hKnormal : K.Normal) : H.Normal := by sorry`:
  Given subgroups H, K ≤ G with H ≤ K, H characteristic in K, and K normal in G, conclude H is normal in G. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the task.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful.
- The natural language statement: If H ≤ K, H is characteristic in K, and K is normal in G, then H is normal in G.
- The Lean theorem states exactly this. The custom definition of IsCharacteristic correctly captures “H is fixed by every group automorphism of K,” and it also includes H ≤ K within the definition. The theorem additionally takes H ≤ K as a separate hypothesis; this is redundant but not harmful and still faithful to the original statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Minor redundancy: H ≤ K is both a separate hypothesis and part of IsCharacteristic. This does not change the meaning.
- No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition IsCharacteristic is substantive and correctly formalizes the intended notion. Normality is the standard Mathlib notion. No suspicious or placeholder constructs.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- The theorem statement `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_2a : Irreducible (X^4 - 4 * X^3 + C (6) : Polynomial ℤ) := by sorry` says: The polynomial X^4 − 4 X^3 + C 6, viewed as a polynomial with integer coefficients (i.e., in ℤ[x]), is irreducible.
Here, `X` denotes the polynomial variable, `C 6` is the constant polynomial 6, and the type annotation `: Polynomial ℤ` specifies ℤ[x]. `Irreducible` is Mathlib’s standard predicate for irreducibility in a monoid, specialized here to polynomials over ℤ.

2) Faithfulness check:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that x^4 − 4x^3 + 6 is irreducible in ℤ[x].” The Lean theorem asserts exactly that `X^4 - 4 * X^3 + C 6` is irreducible in `Polynomial ℤ`. There are no extra hypotheses, no weakening/strengthening, and the polynomial matches exactly the given one (no x^2 or x terms, constant term 6).

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the only object is the theorem declaration with the correct statement. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task since we only assess the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library of mathematical definitions and theorems.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_4_27 {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [Nontrivial R] {a : R} (ha : IsNilpotent a) : ∀ b : R, IsUnit (1 - a * b) := by sorry`
  • Fix a type `R` with a commutative ring structure `[CommRing R]`.
  • Assume `[Nontrivial R]`, which entails in this context that `1 ≠ 0` (this is the intended meaning in the natural language statement).
  • Fix an element `a : R` and assume `ha : IsNilpotent a` (i.e., there exists `n` with `a^n = 0`).
  • Claim: For every `b : R`, the element `1 - a * b` is a unit (`IsUnit`).

2) Faithfulness check of the whole statement:
The natural language statement says: Let R be a commutative ring with 1 ≠ 0. If a is nilpotent then 1 − ab is a unit for all b ∈ R. This matches the Lean theorem exactly:
- Commutativity: `[CommRing R]` matches.
- The condition `1 ≠ 0`: encoded as `[Nontrivial R]`, which is the standard way to exclude the zero ring and corresponds to the intended assumption.
- Nilpotent `a`: `IsNilpotent a` matches.
- Conclusion: For all `b : R`, `1 - a * b` is a unit.
No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final comparison:
The mathematical content is the same. The only slight technical difference is the use of `[Nontrivial R]` instead of explicitly stating `1 ≠ 0`, which is a standard and acceptable formalization choice and does not change the intended meaning. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This states: For any type K with a field structure, and any subring S of K, if 1_K belongs to S, then S is an integral domain. The proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: ""Prove that any subring of a field which contains the identity is an integral domain."" The Lean statement matches this precisely: it assumes K is a field, S is a subring of K, assumes 1 ∈ S (i.e., contains the identity), and concludes S is an integral domain.

Note: In Mathlib, `Subring K` already includes `1 ∈ S` by definition, so the hypothesis `h` is redundant. However, including it explicitly still matches the natural language phrasing and does not change the meaning. No auxiliary definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof is given, which is acceptable per the guidelines.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
Yes. Both assert that a (unital) subring of a field containing 1 is an integral domain. The minor redundancy of assuming `1 ∈ S` despite `Subring` already containing 1 does not change the content. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: We work in an arbitrary group G.
- `variable (x : G) (n : ℕ)`: Fix an element x in G and a natural number n.
- `variable (h_gen : Subgroup.closure ({x} : Set G) = (⊤ : Subgroup G))`: The subgroup generated by x is the whole group; i.e., G is cyclic generated by x.
- `variable (h_order : OrderOf x = n)`: The order of x is n (with Mathlib convention: OrderOf x = 0 means x has infinite order).
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_2_4_16c` states: For every subgroup H of G, H is maximal if and only if there exists a natural number p such that p is prime, p divides n, and H equals the subgroup generated by x^p (written as `Subgroup.closure ({x ^ p} : Set G)`). The proof is omitted with `by sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If G = ⟨x⟩ is cyclic of order n ≥ 1, then a subgroup H is maximal iff H = ⟨x^p⟩ for some prime p dividing n.
- The code imposes that G is cyclic generated by x (via `closure {x} = ⊤`) and that the order of x is n (via `OrderOf x = n`). In a cyclic group generated by x with finite order, this matches the group order equalling n. The theorem’s conclusion precisely matches “H is maximal iff H = ⟨x^p⟩ for some prime p | n,” using Mathlib’s notation for generated subgroups.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The only substantive difference is that the Lean code does not assume `n ≥ 1`. In Mathlib, `OrderOf x = 0` corresponds to x having infinite order, so combined with `closure {x} = ⊤`, the code also covers the infinite cyclic case (G ≃ ℤ). In that case, the statement still remains true and the condition `p ∣ n` becomes vacuous (since every p divides 0), yielding the expected classification of maximal subgroups as those generated by x^p for some prime p. Thus the Lean statement is a slight generalization, not a weakening or a mismatch.
- Notationally, `Subgroup.closure ({x ^ p} : Set G)` is the standard Mathlib way to write ⟨x^p⟩, so this is faithful.
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions are introduced; the assumptions are standard Mathlib notions, and the theorem statement is genuine.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to a harmless slight generalization (omission of n ≥ 1), and matches the intended mathematical content.

- Docstring: States the exercise: There is no rational number whose square is 12.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_2 : ¬ ∃ q : ℚ, q^2 = 12 := by sorry` translates to: “It is not the case that there exists a rational number q such that q squared equals 12.” Here `¬ ∃ q : ℚ, q^2 = 12` is standard formalization of “there is no rational number whose square is 12.” The use of `^2` is the usual exponentiation on rationals and `12` is the rational number 12.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement. There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; it's a single theorem declaration with the correct logical content.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We work over a commutative ring R.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_2_2 (p : Polynomial R) : (∃ q : Polynomial R, q ≠ 0 ∧ p * q = 0) ↔ (∃ b : R, b ≠ 0 ∧ Polynomial.C b * p = 0) := by sorry`
  This states: For a polynomial p over R, the following are equivalent:
  (i) there exists a nonzero polynomial q such that p * q = 0 in R[x], and
  (ii) there exists a nonzero element b in R such that C(b) * p = 0 in R[x] (i.e., multiplying p by the constant polynomial b yields 0). No proof is provided (`sorry`), but the statement is clear.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let p(x) ∈ R[x]. Prove that p(x) is a zero divisor in R[x] if and only if there exists a nonzero b ∈ R such that b p(x) = 0.
- The left-hand side “p(x) is a zero divisor in R[x]” is commonly defined as: there exists a nonzero q ∈ R[x] with p q = 0 (often also requiring p ≠ 0, depending on convention). The Lean statement uses exactly the condition ∃ q ≠ 0 with p * q = 0. The right-hand side “there exists a nonzero b ∈ R with b p(x) = 0” is modeled in Lean by ∃ b ≠ 0 with C b * p = 0, which is the standard way to express scalar multiplication by b in the polynomial ring.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Content-wise, yes: the equivalence between “p is (left) a zero divisor” and “there exists nonzero b ∈ R annihilating p” is exactly what the Lean theorem states.
- Minor nuance: Some texts define “zero divisor” to exclude the element 0, i.e., require p ≠ 0 in addition to ∃ q ≠ 0 with p q = 0. The Lean statement does not include the assumption p ≠ 0 on the left side. However, the equivalence asserted still holds even when p = 0 (both sides are true), and the exercise’s intended equivalence is preserved. This is a slight generalization that does not change the mathematical content of the equivalence.
- All auxiliary aspects are legitimate: No placeholder/vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib constructs are used; using Polynomial.C b * p to represent b · p is appropriate in Mathlib.

Given this, the translation is faithful, with only a minor definitional nuance about whether zero itself is considered a zero divisor. This is acceptable as a slight generalization per the guidelines.

  `theorem lean_13_rudin_1_13 (x y : ℂ) : |Complex.abs x - Complex.abs y| ≤ Complex.abs (x - y) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For all complex numbers x and y, the absolute value (in R) of the difference of their moduli, | |x| − |y| |, is less than or equal to the modulus of their difference, |x − y|. Here `Complex.abs z` denotes the complex modulus |z| (a real number), and the outer `| ... |` on the left is the real absolute value; on the right `Complex.abs (x - y)` is the modulus of the complex difference.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is exactly: If x, y are complex, prove that ||x|-|y|| ≤ |x-y|.
- The Lean theorem quantifies x, y : ℂ and asserts | |x| − |y| | ≤ |x − y| with the correct interpretations of absolute values (Real abs outside, Complex modulus inside). This is precisely the same inequality.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The statement is a faithful formalization; it is a standard inequality for complex numbers.
- The Lean version is a direct specialization to ℂ (exactly the domain in the natural language). No mismatch.

Here `Complex.abs w` is the modulus |w|, and `(r : Complex) * w` is the product in Complex after viewing r as a complex number.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: For any complex z, there exists r ≥ 0 (real) and a complex w with |w| = 1 such that z = r w. The Lean statement exactly asserts the existence of such r and w with the same properties, using `Complex.abs w = 1` for |w| = 1 and `(r : Complex) * w` for the product r w in Complex. No additional or missing conditions are present.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Quantification over z: matches.
- Existence of r ∈ ℝ with r ≥ 0: matches.
- Existence of w ∈ ℂ with |w| = 1: matches (`Complex.abs w = 1`).
- Equality z = r w: matches (`z = (r : Complex) * w`).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement requires φ to be a surjective ring homomorphism: “Let φ: R → S be a surjective homomorphism of rings. Prove that the image of the center of R is contained in the center of S.”
- In the Lean code, although a surjectivity hypothesis `hφ : Function.Surjective φ` is declared as a variable, it is not actually part of the theorem's statement. The theorem as written depends only on φ, not on hφ. In Lean, variables not appearing in the statement are not parameters of the theorem, so the theorem claims the inclusion for any ring homomorphism φ, with no surjectivity assumption.
- This is a significant mismatch: the result is generally false without surjectivity. Therefore, the formal statement is strictly stronger than the intended one and is not faithful to the original statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean theorem omits the crucial surjectivity hypothesis in its statement, thereby asserting a stronger and generally false claim. No vacuous definitions are present, and the sets used do represent the centers, but the missing hypothesis breaks faithfulness.

  Natural language: In the polynomial ring with integer coefficients and countably many variables indexed by ℕ (i.e., Z[x₀, x₁, x₂, ...]), define the ideal I generated by the set of products X(2k)·X(2k+1) for k ∈ ℕ; that is, generated by x₀x₁, x₂x₃, x₄x₅, ...
- Theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_1_10`: There exists a function `P : ℕ → Ideal (MvPolynomial ℕ ℤ)` such that for every n, P n is prime, contains I, and is minimal among prime ideals containing I (i.e., if Q is prime with I ≤ Q ≤ P n then Q = P n). Moreover, `P` is injective, so the `P n` are all distinct.

2) Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: The quotient ring Z[x₁, x₂, x₃, ...]/(x₁x₂, x₃x₄, x₅x₆, ...) has infinitely many minimal prime ideals.
- The Lean code works in R = MvPolynomial ℕ ℤ (Z[x₀, x₁, x₂, ...]) and defines I to be the ideal generated by x₀x₁, x₂x₃, x₄x₅, ... . This is the same pattern as the natural language ideal, but with indexing starting at 0 instead of 1; this is an immaterial shift (variable renaming equivalence).
- Minimal prime ideals of the quotient ring R/I correspond bijectively to prime ideals P of R that contain I and are minimal among such primes (via the correspondence P ↦ P/I). The theorem asserts there are infinitely many distinct prime ideals P n minimal over I, hence the quotient ring has infinitely many minimal prime ideals. Distinctness is ensured by `Function.Injective P`.
- Therefore, the theorem exactly captures the intended statement, expressed in the ambient ring rather than the quotient, which is standard and equivalent.

3) Final check and differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `I` is genuinely defined, and standard Mathlib notions like `Ideal.IsPrime` are used. The only `sorry` is in the proof, which is acceptable per the task.
- The only superficial difference is the index shift (x₀,x₁ vs x₁,x₂), which is harmless and does not change the mathematical content.
- The Lean formulation explicitly states minimality among primes over I and injective indexing to express infinitude, which matches the natural statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  - This states: For a set `A` of real numbers, if `A` is nonempty (`A.Nonempty`) and bounded below (`BddBelow A`), then `Inf A = - Sup (A.image fun x => -x)`.

  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but our task is only to check the statement’s faithfulness.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let `A` be a nonempty subset of reals bounded below. Let `-A = { -x | x ∈ A }`. Prove `inf A = - sup (-A)`.
- The Lean statement exactly mirrors this:
  - Domain: `A : Set ℝ` (subset of reals).
  - Assumptions: `A.Nonempty` and `BddBelow A`.
  - Conclusion: `Inf A = - Sup (A.image (fun x => -x))`, which is exactly `inf A = - sup (-A)`.
- Using `image` for `-A` is a standard formalization and equivalent to the set `{ -x | x ∈ A }`.
- Using `Inf`/`Sup` is the Mathlib notation for infimum/supremum of sets in ℝ. This matches the natural language use of `inf` and `sup`.

  - `IsField (Z_i ⧸ Ideal.span ({(q : Z_i)} : Set Z_i))` asserts Z_i modulo the ideal generated by the element q (viewed inside Z_i) is a field. This is exactly ℤ[i]/(q) being a field.
  - `Fintype (Z_i ⧸ Ideal.span ({(q : Z_i)} : Set Z_i))` asserts this quotient is finite.
  - `Fintype.card (Z_i ⧸ Ideal.span ({(q : Z_i)} : Set Z_i)) = q ^ 2` asserts it has exactly q^2 elements.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let q ∈ ℤ be a prime with q ≡ 3 (mod 4). Prove that ℤ[i]/(q) is a field with q^2 elements.
- The code models ℤ[i] as ℤ[X]/(X^2+1), which is a standard and faithful representation. The ideal (q) in ℤ[i] is represented as the ideal generated by the element q in Z_i, i.e., `Ideal.span { (q : Z_i) }`, which matches the usual (q) ⊂ ℤ[i] under the canonical embedding ℤ → ℤ[i].
- The condition on q is encoded as `q : ℕ`, `q.Prime`, and `q % 4 = 3`. Using ℕ instead of ℤ is a benign specialization since a “prime integer” is customarily taken to be a positive prime, and the congruence condition matches the intended meaning. This is a standard formalization choice and does not change the mathematical content.
- The conclusions exactly match the statement: the quotient is a field and has q^2 elements. The extra conjunct `Fintype (...)` is redundant given the cardinality statement but harmless and consistent with the intended result.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; `Z_i` is a legitimate construction using Mathlib notions, and all terms are standard.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem faithfully formalizes the given statement (with the minor, acceptable specialization q ∈ ℕ instead of q ∈ ℤ). No discrepancies affecting meaning were found.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Finset`: Bring Mathlib and finite set operations into scope.
- Docstring: States the proposition informally: For k ≥ 2 and x in ℝ^k, there exists a nonzero y in ℝ^k orthogonal to x. Notes that ℝ^k is represented as `Fin k → ℝ` and the dot product is represented by the finite sum over `Fin k`.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_18a {k : Nat} (hk : 2 ≤ k) (x : Fin k → ℝ) : ∃ y : Fin k → ℝ, y ≠ fun _ => 0 ∧ (Finset.univ.sum fun i : Fin k => x i * y i) = 0 := by sorry`
  • Parameters: `k : Nat` with hypothesis `hk : 2 ≤ k`, and a vector `x : Fin k → ℝ` (i.e., an element of ℝ^k).
  • Conclusion: There exists `y : Fin k → ℝ` such that `y ≠ fun _ => 0` (i.e., y is not the zero vector) and `Finset.univ.sum (fun i : Fin k => x i * y i) = 0` (i.e., the dot product of x and y equals 0).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If k ≥ 2 and x ∈ ℝ^k, there exists y ∈ ℝ^k with y ≠ 0 and x ⋅ y = 0.
- Lean: Matches exactly, representing ℝ^k as functions `Fin k → ℝ` and the dot product as the finite sum of componentwise products. The nonzero condition is encoded as `y ≠ fun _ => 0`.
- No extra or missing hypotheses; the existential and orthogonality conditions are present.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code uses an explicit sum for the dot product rather than a named dot product operator, which is a standard faithful formalization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` in the proof (acceptable per instructions since we only check the statement's faithfulness).
- Thus, the two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib; no mathematical content.
- Comment: `/-- As vector spaces over ℚ, ℝ^n ≃ ℝ for all n ≥ 1. -/` states the intended theorem in words.
- `theorem real_pow_eq_real_as_Q_vector_spaces (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) : Nonempty (ℝ ≃ₗ[ℚ] (Fin n → ℝ)) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: for any natural number `n` with `0 < n`, there exists a ℚ-linear equivalence between `ℝ` and `(Fin n → ℝ)`. The type `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the standard Lean representation of ℝ^n. `≃ₗ[ℚ]` denotes a linear isomorphism over ℚ. `Nonempty` asserts existence of such an isomorphism (no canonical choice). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “Prove that as vector spaces over ℚ, ℝ^n ≅ ℝ, for all n ∈ ℤ^+.”
- Lean: Asserts existence of a ℚ-linear equivalence between ℝ and ℝ^n for all `n ≥ 1` (since `n : ℕ` and `0 < n`). The order of factors (ℝ vs ℝ^n) is swapped but linear equivalence is symmetric, so it matches. The formulation with `Nonempty (ℝ ≃ₗ[ℚ] (Fin n → ℝ))` matches the existential meaning of “≅”. The scalar field ℚ is explicitly specified.

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The domain/codomain swap is immaterial (isomorphism is symmetric).
- The restriction `n > 0` matches “n ∈ ℤ^+”.
- Interpreting ℝ^n as `(Fin n → ℝ)` is standard.
Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem add_rational_irrational (r x : ℝ) (hr : r ≠ 0) (hx : Irrational x) : Irrational (r + x)` reads: For real numbers r and x, if r ≠ 0 and x is irrational, then r + x is irrational.
- There are no other hypotheses or definitions; in particular, there is no assumption that r is rational.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: If r is rational (r ≠ 0) and x is irrational, then r + x is irrational.
- The Lean statement omits the crucial hypothesis that r is rational; it only assumes r ≠ 0 and x irrational.
- This omission materially changes the meaning and truth of the statement. The Lean statement is false: e.g., take r = √2 (irrational, nonzero) and x = −√2 (irrational); then r + x = 0 is rational, contradicting the conclusion.
- The presence of the nonzero condition matches the natural language but is unnecessary mathematically; however, the key missing rationality hypothesis makes the translation unfaithful.

Auxiliary definitions:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; nothing vacuous. The issue is solely that the theorem statement is missing a critical assumption.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem and the natural language statement are different: the code asserts a stronger (and false) claim by dropping the rationality of r. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R] [IsDomain R]`: We work with a commutative ring R that is an integral domain.

- Hypothesis `h1`:
  For all a b in R, with a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0, there exist elements d, r, s in R such that:
  • d divides a and d divides b,
  • for every e in R, if e divides a and e divides b then e divides d (so d is a greatest common divisor in the divisibility order, unique up to units),
  • and d = r*a + s*b (Bezout identity).
  This matches (i): any two nonzero elements have a gcd that can be written as r a + s b.

- Hypothesis `h2`:
  For any sequence a : ℕ → R with a(i+1) ∣ a(i) for all i, there exists N : ℕ such that for all n ≥ N there exists a unit u with a(n) = u * a(N). This encodes stabilization up to associates of a divisibility chain.

- Conclusion: `IsPrincipalIdealRing R`. Since we already have `[IsDomain R]`, this corresponds to R being a Principal Ideal Domain in the usual sense (an integral domain in which every ideal is principal).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- (i) is faithfully encoded by `h1`: it requires a gcd (in the divisibility sense) for nonzero a, b, and that this gcd is a linear combination r a + s b.

- (ii) is close but not identical: The natural language requires the sequence a_1, a_2, ... to consist of nonzero elements. The Lean hypothesis `h2` imposes the stabilization condition for all divisibility chains (a : ℕ → R), without assuming the a_i are nonzero. This is a strictly stronger assumption than in the natural language statement. Also, the Lean statement allows N = 0 (since N : ℕ), whereas the natural language says “positive integer N.” This indexing/positivity difference is minor and usually harmless, but the missing nonzero assumption is a real strengthening.

- The conclusion in Lean is `IsPrincipalIdealRing R` rather than an explicit “PID,” but together with `[IsDomain R]` this matches the intended “Principal Ideal Domain,” so this is fine.

Step 3: Final check: are the two problems the same?
- They are almost the same, but not exactly. The Lean code assumes a stronger condition (ii): stabilization for every divisibility chain, not just for chains of nonzero elements. Therefore, the Lean theorem is a specialization with stronger hypotheses and does not exactly match the original statement. The difference about N being allowed to be 0 is minor; the main discrepancy is the missing nonzero requirement in (ii).

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to the stronger hypothesis (ii). Otherwise, the translation is very close.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_2_24 {α : Type _} [MetricSpace α]` introduces a type α with a metric space structure.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ s : Set α, Set.Infinite s → ∃ x : α, ∀ (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε → ∃ y ∈ s, y ≠ x ∧ dist y x < ε` says: for every subset s of α, if s is infinite, then there exists a point x in α such that for every ε > 0 there exists a point y in s, y ≠ x, with dist(y, x) < ε. This is exactly the definition that s has a limit (accumulation) point x.
- Conclusion `∃ s : Set α, s.Countable ∧ Dense s` asserts that there exists a countable dense subset of α, i.e., α is separable.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “Let X be a metric space in which every infinite subset has a limit point. Prove that X is separable.”
- Lean hypothesis matches “every infinite subset has a limit point,” and the conclusion matches “X is separable” via existence of a countable dense subset.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The notion of limit point used in Lean (∀ ε>0 ∃ y ∈ s, y ≠ x ∧ dist y x < ε) is standard and faithful.
- Separable is expressed as existence of a countable dense subset, which is the standard definition. Using Countable (allowing finite) is acceptable and standard.

  Translation: Let k be a natural number with k ≥ 3. Let x, y be points in ℝ^k (modeled as functions Fin k → ℝ). Assume 0 < dist x y (so the distance between x and y is positive). Let r be a real number such that 2r > dist x y. Then the set of points z in ℝ^k satisfying dist z x = r and dist z y = r is infinite.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Suppose k ≥ 3, x, y ∈ ℝ^k, |x − y| = d > 0, and r > 0. Prove that if 2r > d, there are infinitely many z ∈ ℝ^k such that |z − x| = |z − y| = r.
- Lean code: Uses k ≥ 3, x, y ∈ ℝ^k, assumes 0 < dist x y (equivalent to d > 0 when d = dist x y), and 2r > dist x y. Concludes the set {z | dist z x = r ∧ dist z y = r} is infinite.
- The code avoids introducing an explicit variable d, instead directly using dist x y. This is faithful since d := dist x y in the statement. The code does not assume r > 0 explicitly, but 2r > dist x y with dist x y ≥ 0 (indeed > 0 by hxy) implies r > 0, so the positivity of r is implicit and follows from the given hypothesis. The ambient space ℝ^k is modeled as Fin k → ℝ with the Euclidean metric; dist is the Euclidean distance in this context. The conclusion “Set.Infinite …” matches “infinitely many z”.

3) Final check — equivalence of the two statements:
- Hypotheses match (k ≥ 3, x,y ∈ ℝ^k, |x − y| > 0, 2r > |x − y|). The explicit naming of d in the natural language statement is simply omitted by identifying d with dist x y. The implicit requirement r > 0 is a consequence of 2r > dist x y and dist x y ≥ 0, so nothing is lost. The conclusion matches exactly: infinitely many points z with equal distances r to x and y.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct and faithful. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: We work with a finite group G.
- `variable {p : ℕ} [Fact (Nat.Prime p)]`: p is a prime number.
- `open Subgroup`: We will use Subgroup notation.
- Theorem statement:
  `theorem sylow_normal_inter_unique {P H : Subgroup G}
    (hP : IsSylow p P) (hnormal : P.Normal) :
    IsSylow p (P ⊓ H) ∧
    ∀ (Q : Subgroup H), IsSylow p Q → (Q : Subgroup G) = P ⊓ H := by sorry`
  Interpreting this:
  - Hypotheses: P and H are subgroups of G; P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G; P is normal in G.
  - Conclusion is a conjunction of two statements:
    (a) `IsSylow p (P ⊓ H)`: As written, this asserts that the intersection P ∩ H (viewed as a subgroup of G) is itself a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
    (b) `∀ (Q : Subgroup H), IsSylow p Q → (Q : Subgroup G) = P ⊓ H`: For any Sylow p-subgroup Q of the subgroup H (i.e., Q ≤ H, with IsSylow computed in the group H), the corresponding subgroup of G (viewed via inclusion) equals P ∩ H. This expresses uniqueness of the Sylow p-subgroup of H and identifies it with P ∩ H.

2) Faithfulness check against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup of G and H ≤ G is arbitrary, then P ∩ H is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of H.
- Part (b) of the Lean statement captures the uniqueness correctly: every Sylow p-subgroup of H equals P ∩ H (viewed in G). This is exactly the uniqueness claim.
- However, part (a) in the Lean statement is incorrect in context: `IsSylow p (P ⊓ H)` is interpreted in the ambient group G, not in H. The natural language requires “P ∩ H is a Sylow p-subgroup of H,” i.e., IsSylow p (something in Subgroup H). To express this correctly in Lean, one would typically use the subgroup of H given by the preimage of P under the inclusion homomorphism H → G, namely `P.comap H.subtype`, and then assert `IsSylow p (P.comap H.subtype)`. Equivalently, they could assert that `(Q : Subgroup G) = P ⊓ H` for the unique Sylow Q ≤ H (as they do) and thereby deduce that P ∩ H is Sylow in H, but the explicit conjunct `IsSylow p (P ⊓ H)` is stronger and generally false.

3) Final comparison:
- The second clause matches the uniqueness statement faithfully.
- The first clause is an incorrect strengthening: it states P ∩ H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, not of H. This does not match the natural language and is generally false.
- Therefore, the overall theorem statement is not a faithful translation, despite containing the correct uniqueness component.

Suggested correction to be faithful: replace `IsSylow p (P ⊓ H)` with `IsSylow p (P.comap H.subtype)` (a subgroup of H whose image in G is exactly P ⊓ H), and keep the uniqueness clause phrased in terms of subgroups of H mapped into G.

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, providing real numbers, square root, finite sums, filters, and convergence notions.
- Comment explains the intended statement: define a_i = sqrt(i+1) - sqrt(i) and show the partial sums diverge to +∞, formalized as tending to atTop in ℝ.

  This states: The function n ↦ ∑_{i in range n} (sqrt(i+1) − sqrt(i)) tends to atTop as n → atTop (i.e., as n → ∞ over ℕ). Here `Finset.range n` is the finite set {0, 1, ..., n−1}, so the sum is exactly ∑_{i < n} a_i with a_i = sqrt(i+1) − sqrt(i), and `Tendsto ... atTop atTop` is the standard formalization that the sequence diverges to +∞ in ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The sequence a_i is exactly defined as a_i = sqrt(i+1) − sqrt(i) (with i coerced to ℝ inside sqrt).
- The partial sums are ∑_{i < n} a_i, implemented via Finset.range n.
- The conclusion “lim = ∞” is precisely captured by `Tendsto ... atTop (atTop : Filter ℝ)` in ℝ.
Thus, the code states exactly the same claim.

- Domain/codomain: Real numbers with Real.sqrt; consistent.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given (with proof omitted). The omission of proof does not affect the faithfulness of the statement being formalized.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type*} {Y : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y]`: X and Y are types equipped with metric space structures.
- `theorem image_closure_subset_closure_image {E : Set X} {f : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) : f '' closure E ⊆ closure (f '' E) := ...`: For any set E in X and any function f from X to Y that is continuous, the image under f of the closure of E is contained in the closure of the image f(E). Here `''` denotes image and `closure` is the topological closure.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f is a continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric space Y, then f(\overline{E}) ⊆ \overline{f(E)} for every E ⊆ X.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: both domain and codomain are metric spaces, f is continuous, E is arbitrary, and the conclusion is `f '' closure E ⊆ closure (f '' E)`.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Quantifiers and hypotheses align: continuity of f, metric spaces for X and Y, arbitrary E.
- Conclusion matches the inclusion between the image of the closure and the closure of the image.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is provided. The presence of `sorry` omits the proof but does not affect the fidelity of the statement per the instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Exercise 2.28 (translation):
In a separable metric space, every closed set is the union of a (possibly empty)
perfect set and a set which is at most countable.

We formulate ``perfect set'' as a closed set with no isolated points, i.e.
for every x in t we have x ∈ closure (t \ {x}).

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `X` is a type with a `MetricSpace` structure and `SeparableSpace X`. `s : Set X` is a subset of `X` and `hs : IsClosed s` asserts that `s` is closed.
- Goal: There exist sets `t u : Set X` such that:
  - `s = t ∪ u`: the closed set `s` is the union of `t` and `u`.
  - `IsClosed t`: `t` is closed in the ambient space `X`.
  - `(∀ x, x ∈ t → x ∈ closure (t \ {x}))`: for every point `x` of `t`, `x` lies in the closure of `t` without `x` itself; i.e., `t` has no isolated points. This is a standard formalization of “perfect”.
  - `Countable u`: `u` is at most countable (in Mathlib, `Countable` means finite or countably infinite, including possibly empty).
No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions: `MetricSpace`, `SeparableSpace`, `IsClosed`, `closure`, set difference, `Countable`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: In a separable metric space, every closed set is the union of a (possibly empty) perfect set and a set which is at most countable.
- The Lean theorem fixes an arbitrary closed set `s` in a separable metric space and asserts the existence of `t` (closed with no isolated points, i.e., perfect) and `u` (countable) with `s = t ∪ u`.
- The possibility that the perfect set is empty is allowed (the existential does not forbid `t = ∅`, and the conditions hold vacuously). The equality `s = t ∪ u` also ensures both `t ⊆ s` and `u ⊆ s`, matching the intended decomposition of `s`.
- The formulation of “perfect set” as `IsClosed t ∧ ∀ x ∈ t, x ∈ closure (t \ {x})` is standard and correct in metric spaces.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous requirements (e.g., disjointness) are imposed.
- All hypotheses match exactly (separable metric space; closed subset).
- All conclusions match exactly (union of a perfect set and an at-most-countable set).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all are legitimate Mathlib concepts.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- Comment explains the same statement as in Rudin 4.5(a): extend a continuous real function from a closed subset E ⊆ ℝ to a continuous function on ℝ.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set` are standard.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{E : Set ℝ} (hE : IsClosed E)`: E is a subset of ℝ and is closed.
  - `(f : E → ℝ)`: f is a function defined on the subtype E (i.e., its domain is E), real-valued.
  - `(hf : Continuous f)`: f is continuous with respect to the subspace topology on E, which matches the usual notion of continuity on a subset.
  - Conclusion: `∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g ∧ ∀ x (hx : x ∈ E), g x = f ⟨x, hx⟩`.
    This asserts there exists a continuous function g: ℝ → ℝ such that for every x ∈ E, the values agree: g(x) = f(x). The notation `f ⟨x, hx⟩` is exactly the value of f at the subtype element corresponding to x with proof hx : x ∈ E. So this is the formal way to say g restricted to E equals f.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language states: If f is a real continuous function on a closed set E ⊂ ℝ, then there exists a continuous real function g on ℝ such that g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.
- The Lean theorem precisely encodes this: E closed, f : E → ℝ continuous, and there exists g : ℝ → ℝ continuous with g|_E = f.
- The subtype phrasing and continuity on the subspace topology exactly match the intended meaning.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; no placeholders. The presence of `sorry` is only for the proof and does not affect the translation audit.
- The only potential linguistic discrepancy is the plural ""functions g"" in the English text, which is standard phrasing but logically means ""there exists a function""; the Lean statement is the correct existential formulation.
- Otherwise, the math problems are identical: both assert the Tietze extension (special case) for ℝ.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: bring Mathlib and polynomial namespace into scope.
- `variable (n : ℕ) (hpos : 3 < n) (hsq : Squarefree n)`: Fix a natural number n with the hypotheses that n > 3 and n is squarefree. This matches “n is a squarefree integer greater than 3” (treating ‘integer > 3’ as a positive integer).
- `def R := AdjoinRoot (Polynomial.X ^ 2 + Polynomial.C (n : Int))`: Define R to be Z[X]/(X^2 + n), i.e., the quotient by the polynomial X^2 + n with integer coefficients. This is a standard formalization of Z[√(-n)], since in this quotient the image α of X satisfies α^2 + n = 0, so α^2 = -n.
- `def alpha : R := AdjoinRoot.root (Polynomial.X ^ 2 + Polynomial.C (n : Int))`: Define α to be the class of X in the quotient, i.e., a root of X^2 + n. This plays the role of √(-n).
- `theorem irreducible_two : Irreducible (2 : R) := by sorry`: Statement that 2 is irreducible in R.
- `theorem irreducible_sqrt_neg_n : Irreducible (alpha : R) := by sorry`: Statement that α (i.e., √(-n)) is irreducible in R.
- `theorem irreducible_one_plus_sqrt_neg_n : Irreducible (1 + alpha : R) := by sorry`: Statement that 1 + α (i.e., 1 + √(-n)) is irreducible in R.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The ring R is correctly modeled as Z[√(-n)] via AdjoinRoot of X^2 + n over Z.
- α is exactly the adjoined root satisfying α^2 = -n, i.e., √(-n).
- The three target elements are precisely 2, √(-n), and 1 + √(-n), and the claims are that each is irreducible in R.
- The hypotheses “n is squarefree and > 3” are present as variables in context and hence part of the theorem statements (through the parameterization of R and α by n, hpos, hsq). Although R does not depend semantically on hpos and hsq, including them as parameters is harmless and keeps the intended scope of the theorems.
- No vacuous placeholders are used for definitions; AdjoinRoot and the polynomials are standard Mathlib constructs. The use of `sorry` in proofs does not affect the faithfulness of the statement being formalized.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The formal statement matches the original: For n a squarefree integer greater than 3, in R = Z[√(-n)], the elements 2, √(-n) (alpha), and 1 + √(-n) (1 + alpha) are asserted to be irreducible. The only minor technical difference is representing the ring as an AdjoinRoot over Z and taking n as a natural number rather than an integer, which is fully consistent with n > 3. Thus, the two statements are the same in mathematical content.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem baire_category_theorem {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X] [Nonempty X]`: Let X be a type equipped with a metric space structure, complete, and nonempty. This matches “X is a nonempty complete metric space.”
- `(G : ℕ → Set X)`: Let {G_n} be a sequence (ℕ-indexed family) of subsets of X.

- `:= by sorry`: Proof omitted; this does not affect the statement.

All terms used are standard Mathlib notions: MetricSpace, CompleteSpace, Nonempty, IsOpen, Dense, and the big intersection notation (⋂ n, G n).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Suppose X is a nonempty complete metric space, and {G_n} is a sequence of dense open sets of X. Prove Baire's theorem, namely, that ⋂_{1}^{∞} G_n is not empty.” The code assumes exactly these hypotheses (nonempty complete metric space; sequence of open dense sets) and concludes exactly that the countable intersection is nonempty. The index set is ℕ, matching “sequence.” The conclusion is nonemptiness, as requested. Although the classical Baire theorem also yields density of the intersection, the problem only asks for nonemptiness; the code asserts precisely that.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The only minor nuance is that the code uses ℕ starting at 0 rather than 1, but for a sequence indexed by ℕ this is standard and immaterial to the content. Thus the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Set` opens the namespace for set-theoretic notation like `''` and `closure`.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y]` declares X and Y as types equipped with metric space structures, matching the natural language's metric spaces.
- `variable (f : X → Y) (E : Set X)` declares a function f from X to Y and a subset E of X.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_4a (hf : Continuous f) (hdense : Dense E) : range f ⊆ closure (f '' E) := by sorry`
  translates to: Given f is continuous and E is dense in X, the image of X under f (i.e., `range f = f '' univ = f(X)`) is contained in the closure of the image of E under f (i.e., `closure (f '' E)`). This is exactly the formal statement that f(E) is dense in f(X), since f(E) ⊆ f(X) and the closure of f(E) contains f(X).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""Let f and g be continuous mappings of a metric space X into a metric space Y, and let E be a dense subset of X. Prove that f(E) is dense in f(X).""
- The presence of g is extraneous for this claim; the conclusion concerns only f. The Lean code uses only f and matches the intended claim precisely.
- The topological notion of density is captured by `range f ⊆ closure (f '' E)`, i.e., f(X) ⊆ closure(f(E)), which is equivalent to “f(E) is dense in f(X)” since f(E) ⊆ f(X).
- The hypotheses match: continuity of f and density of E in X, within metric spaces (which is appropriate and slightly specialized relative to general topological spaces but consistent with the problem statement).

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are made. The theorem has a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Minor discrepancy: the natural language mentions g, but it is irrelevant to the stated conclusion; the Lean theorem rightly omits it. This does not affect faithfulness.
- Conclusion: The formal statement faithfully translates the mathematical claim.

Line-by-line translation:
- `def s : ℕ → ℝ` with cases:
  - `s 0 = √2`
  - `s 1 = √2`
  - `s (n + 2) = √(2 + √(s (n + 1)))`
  This defines a real sequence indexed by natural numbers. It sets s₀ = √2 and s₁ = √2, and for all n ≥ 0 it defines s_{n+2} in terms of s_{n+1} via s_{n+2} = √(2 + √(s_{n+1})). This is equivalent to the natural-language recursion s_{n+1} = √(2 + √(s_n)) for n ≥ 1, together with the initial condition s₁ = √2. The extra assignment s₀ = √2 is a harmless extension (it does not contradict anything and simply initializes the index 0 as well).
- The theorem states: there exists l ∈ ℝ such that Tendsto (s n) to l as n → ∞ (i.e., the sequence converges), and ∀ n ∈ ℕ, s n < 2. This corresponds to “the sequence converges and s_n < 2 for n = 1,2,3,...” The Lean statement is slightly stronger in that it claims s₀ < 2 as well, but since s₀ is explicitly set to √2, this is consistent and is a mild strengthening rather than a mismatch.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; `s` is a genuine recursive definition, and the theorem is a proper formulation of convergence and the bound.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: s₁ = √2, s_{n+1} = √(2 + √(s_n)) for n ≥ 1; prove convergence and s_n < 2 for n ≥ 1.
- Lean: Same recursion, with an additional definition s₀ = √2; prove convergence and s_n < 2 for all n ≥ 0.
The only difference is inclusion of n=0 in the inequality, which is a harmless slight strengthening and standard when formalizing sequences indexed by ℕ. The convergence claim is exactly as required.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib` / `open Set`: Bring in standard mathematical libraries and open the `Set` namespace.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_19 (f : ℝ → ℝ) ... : Continuous f := by sorry`
  This states: Let f be a function from ℝ to ℝ. Assume two hypotheses and conclude f is continuous.

  Hypothesis `ivp`: `∀ a b c, (min (f a) (f b) < c ∧ c < max (f a) (f b)) → ∃ x, min a b ≤ x ∧ x ≤ max a b ∧ f x = c`.
  Natural language: For all real numbers a, b, c, if c lies strictly between f(a) and f(b) (expressed symmetrically using min/max so it covers both possible orders of f(a) and f(b)), then there exists some x between a and b (inclusive, i.e., in [min a b, max a b]) such that f(x) = c. This is a precise formalization of the intermediate value property.

  Hypothesis `hrat`: `∀ (r : ℚ), IsClosed (f ⁻¹' ({r} : Set ℝ))`.
  Natural language: For every rational number r, the set of all x with f(x) = r (i.e., the preimage of {r}) is closed in ℝ. Here r : ℚ is coerced to ℝ inside the singleton {r}, matching the statement that the level sets at rational values are closed.

  Conclusion: `Continuous f` — f is continuous on ℝ.

Faithfulness assessment:
- Domain and codomain are ℝ → ℝ, matching the statement.
- The IVP is formulated in a symmetric way using min/max, which is a standard, slightly more general phrasing than the one-sided “if f(a) < c < f(b) …”. This fully captures the intended intermediate value property. The use of ≤ for “between a and b” aligns with the usual meaning; the statement with strict inequalities for c ensures existence in the closed interval [a, b], which is standard.
- The closedness condition exactly matches: for each rational r, the level set f^{-1}({r}) is closed.
- The conclusion is exactly that f is continuous.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem states the hypothesis and conclusion directly. The presence of `sorry` does not affect the translation check per the task; it is not a placeholder for a definition, just an omitted proof.

Any differences:
- The symmetric min/max formulation is a slight generalization of the one-sided phrasing, but it is mathematically equivalent to the intended IVP and is acceptable.
- “Between a and b” is implemented as x ∈ [min a b, max a b], which is standard and consistent.

Overall, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: In a metric space X, if {p_n} is Cauchy and some subsequence {p_{n_l}} converges to p ∈ X, then {p_n} converges to p.
- Lean statement: Exactly the same content. `CauchySeq p` matches Cauchy; `StrictMono s` ensures a valid subsequence index map; `Tendsto (p ∘ s) atTop (𝓝 a)` is convergence of the subsequence to a; `Tendsto p atTop (𝓝 a)` is convergence of the whole sequence to a. Using `atTop` and `𝓝 a` are the standard Mathlib notions of sequence convergence in metric spaces.

Checks for potential red flags:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are from Mathlib and standard.
- The use of `StrictMono s` is an appropriate formalization of a subsequence (strictly increasing index), fully faithful to the typical mathematical meaning of {p_{n_l}}.
- The different variable names (using `a` instead of `p` for the limit point) do not change the meaning.

Final check: The two statements are the same. No discrepancies found.

The code matches the structure of Abel's test over ℝ: it assumes Σ a_n is summable, b_n is monotone and bounded, and concludes Σ a_n b_n is summable. The only nuance is that `Monotone b` in Lean means nondecreasing specifically, whereas ""monotonic"" in the natural language usually means either nonincreasing or nondecreasing. The code thus treats one direction (nondecreasing) explicitly. The boundedness is encoded as existence of M with |b n| ≤ M, which is the usual notion of bounded sequence.

3) Final check, differences:
- Direction of monotonicity: The code assumes monotone nondecreasing; the natural statement allows either nonincreasing or nondecreasing. This is a slight specialization but captures one valid case of the intended result. Everything else (real sequences, summability, boundedness, product series summable) aligns perfectly. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms (Summable, Monotone) are standard Mathlib notions.

Given the small specialization on monotonicity direction, this is essentially faithful, with a minor restriction.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- Docstring: States intent: let Z_sqrt2 be ℤ[√2], sqrt2 be √2 in it, assume ℤ[√2] is a UFD, and assert that X^2 - sqrt2 is irreducible over ℤ[√2]. This is just a comment, not enforced by code.
- `constant Z_sqrt2 : Type _`: Introduces an arbitrary type symbol Z_sqrt2, with no structure (no ring/semiring, no connection to ℤ[√2]).
- `constant sqrt2 : Z_sqrt2`: Introduces an arbitrary element sqrt2 of that type, with no properties (not specified to be a square root of 2, etc.).
- `open Polynomial`: Opens the Polynomial namespace.
- `def f : Polynomial Z_sqrt2 := X ^ 2 - C sqrt2`: Defines a polynomial over Z_sqrt2 written as X^2 minus the constant term sqrt2. This presupposes Z_sqrt2 has a semiring structure (for `Polynomial Z_sqrt2`, `X`, and `C`) but no such structure is provided. Conceptually it aims at the polynomial x^2 - √2 over Z_sqrt2.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_9 : Irreducible (f : Polynomial Z_sqrt2) := by sorry`: States that f is irreducible over Polynomial Z_sqrt2 (proof omitted). No use or mention of UFD is encoded.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is about the specific ring ℤ[√2], and the specific element √2 in that ring, and the polynomial x^2 - √2 in that ring’s polynomial ring. It also mentions we may assume ℤ[√2] is a UFD (an assumption for the proof, not part of the theorem statement).
- The code uses a completely unspecified type `Z_sqrt2` and an arbitrary element `sqrt2 : Z_sqrt2`. It does not identify `Z_sqrt2` with ℤ[√2] nor `sqrt2` with the square root of 2, nor even provide a semiring/ring structure so that `Polynomial Z_sqrt2` is meaningful. The UFD assumption is only in a comment and not part of any hypothesis or instance.
- Thus, the code does not faithfully model the intended mathematical objects. It is a placeholder rather than a legitimate formalization of “over ℤ[√2]”.

3) Final comparison:
- Intended statement: Irreducible(x^2 − √2) over ℤ[√2].
- Code statement: Irreducible of X^2 − C sqrt2 over Polynomial Z_sqrt2, where Z_sqrt2 is an arbitrary type and sqrt2 an arbitrary element, with no structure or properties attached. The UFD assumption is absent from the formal statement and not used.
- Differences: Missing specification that Z_sqrt2 = ℤ[√2]; missing ring/semiring structure; missing that sqrt2 is the square root of 2; UFD assumption not encoded (acceptable for the theorem statement, but the lack of structure is critical). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Given these issues, the code is not a legitimate, faithful translation of the statement.

  This asserts: For E a subset of ℝ with IsCompact E, and f a function from the subtype E to ℝ, f is continuous (with respect to the subspace topology on E) if and only if the set range (λ x : E, (x.1, f x)) is compact in ℝ × ℝ. Here x.1 is the underlying real number of the subtype element x. The set range (λ x : E, (x.1, f x)) is exactly the graph {(x, f x) | x ∈ E} viewed as a subset of the plane ℝ × ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language confines to E ⊆ ℝ and f real-valued; the Lean code models exactly that with E : Set ℝ and f : E → ℝ.
- The notion of continuity is as a function defined on E with the subspace topology (Continuous f where f : E → ℝ), matching “continuous on E”.
- The graph is represented as a subset of ℝ × ℝ via range (λ x : E, (x.1, f x)), matching “subset of the plane”.
- The compactness hypothesis IsCompact E matches “Suppose E is compact”, and the conclusion/iff about compactness of the graph is stated precisely.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The graph is taken as a subset of ℝ × ℝ (the plane), as in the statement.
- No extra assumptions or restrictions are added; no generalization beyond ℝ is attempted.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_24 {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We consider real numbers a, b and a real-valued function f on ℝ, though we will only use it on (a, b).
- `(hcont : ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b))`: Hypothesis that f is continuous on the open interval (a, b).
- `(hmid : ∀ x y, x ∈ Ioo a b → y ∈ Ioo a b → f ((x + y) / 2) ≤ (f x + f y) / 2)`: Hypothesis that for all x, y in (a, b), the midpoint inequality holds: f((x+y)/2) ≤ (f(x)+f(y))/2.
- Conclusion: `∀ x y, x ∈ Ioo a b → y ∈ Ioo a b → ∀ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, f ((1 - t) * x + t * y) ≤ (1 - t) * f x + t * f y`:
  For all x, y in (a, b) and all t in [0,1], f satisfies the convexity inequality f((1−t)x + t y) ≤ (1−t) f(x) + t f(y). This is precisely the standard pointwise formulation of f being convex on the interval (a, b).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement assumes f is continuous on (a,b) and midpoint convex, and asks to prove f is convex. The Lean statement assumes `ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b)` and the same midpoint convexity on (a,b), and concludes the convexity inequality for all t ∈ [0,1] and x, y ∈ (a, b).
- This matches the definition of convexity on (a, b). Using an explicit inequality rather than a `ConvexOn` predicate is a faithful formulation.
- Treating f as ℝ → ℝ but restricting to (a, b) via hypotheses is standard and faithful to “defined on (a,b)”.
- The use of Icc [0,1] for t is standard in the definition of convexity. The convex combination (1−t)x + t y lies in (a, b) since it is an open interval and convex as a set, so the expression makes sense.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem directly formalizes the statement.
- Potential edge case a ≥ b (empty interval) leads to vacuous truth, which is standard and harmless; the natural language statement typically presumes a < b implicitly, but this does not alter the meaning materially.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {k : ℕ} (a b x : Fin k → ℝ)`: We are working in the space of functions `Fin k → ℝ`, i.e., tuples of k real numbers (intended to model ℝ^k). We have vectors a, b, x in this space.

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_19 : ∃ (c : Fin k → ℝ) (r : ℝ), r > 0 ∧ (∀ x, dist x a = 2 * dist x b ↔ dist x c = r) := by sorry`
  This states: There exist c in ℝ^k and r ∈ ℝ with r > 0 such that for all x in ℝ^k, dist(x, a) = 2·dist(x, b) if and only if dist(x, c) = r. No proof is provided (admitted with sorry).

- `lemma Rudin_exercise_1_19_values (c : Fin k → ℝ) (r : ℝ) : (3 : ℝ) • c = (4 : ℝ) • b - a ∧ 3 * r = 2 * dist b a := by sorry`
  This states: For any c ∈ ℝ^k and r ∈ ℝ (with no assumptions), we have 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2·dist(b, a). Again, no proof (sorry). Note this is claimed unconditionally.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: Given a, b ∈ ℝ^k, find c ∈ ℝ^k and r > 0 such that |x − a| = 2|x − b| iff |x − c| = r, and prove that 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2|b − a|.

- Matching parts:
  - The first theorem aims to capture the existence of c and r > 0 with the exact “iff” condition on distances for all x. That matches the “find c and r such that … iff …”. Using `dist` for |·| is standard.

- Problems:
  1) Space and metric mismatch: The code models ℝ^k as `Fin k → ℝ` without using the EuclideanSpace alias. In mathlib, `Fin k → ℝ` carries the sup (ℓ∞) norm/metric by default (the general Pi-type normed instance), not the Euclidean (ℓ2) metric. Rudin’s |·| in ℝ^k denotes the Euclidean norm. The property that the locus |x − a| = 2|x − b| is a sphere with center c and radius r depends crucially on the Euclidean inner product structure. Therefore, the Lean code is formulating the statement in the ℓ∞ metric, not the Euclidean metric, which is a significant deviation from the intended statement.
  2) The second lemma is missing the essential hypothesis. It states that for arbitrary c and r, one has 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2·dist(b, a). The natural statement asserts these identities for the specific c and r that realize the equivalence |x − a| = 2|x − b| iff |x − c| = r. The Lean lemma does not tie c and r to the property from the first theorem; it makes an unconditional (and false) claim. The correct formalization should include hypotheses like r > 0 and ∀ x, dist x a = 2 * dist x b ↔ dist x c = r, and then conclude 3•c = 4•b − a and 3*r = 2*dist b a.
  3) The code does not provide the explicit formula for c and r, but uses existence, which is fine; however the follow-up lemma meant to characterize those values is improperly stated.

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. There are two major discrepancies:
  - The Lean code uses the default metric on `Fin k → ℝ` (sup norm), not the Euclidean norm implied by Rudin’s |·| on ℝ^k. This changes the meaning of distances and the geometry of the locus.
  - The second lemma is stated without the critical hypothesis linking c and r to the property, making it an entirely different (and incorrect) claim. It does not faithfully express “for the c and r satisfying the iff condition, we have 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2|b − a|”.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the wrong ambient metric/space and a missing hypothesis in the second statement.

",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The file imports Mathlib and includes a comment: ""Corrected version of Rudin Ex. 4.8(b): If E is bounded but not closed in ℝ, then there exists a real function f which is continuous on E but not uniformly continuous on E.""
- The theorem statement: Given a set E ⊆ ℝ with (h_bdd) Bounded E and (h_nonclosed) there exists a ∈ closure E with a ∉ E (i.e., E is not closed), then there exists a function f : ℝ → ℝ such that f is continuous on E (ContinuousOn f E) and f is not uniformly continuous on E (¬UniformContinuousOn f E). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but that's acceptable for auditing the statement.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Original statement: ""Let E be a bounded set in R^1. Prove that there exists a real function f such that f is uniformly continuous and is not bounded on E.""
- The Lean theorem proves something very different: given E bounded and not closed, there exists an f that is continuous on E but not uniformly continuous on E. It requires an extra hypothesis (E not closed) and concludes non-uniform continuity, not unboundedness.
- Moreover, the original statement (as written) is actually false: any uniformly continuous function on a bounded metric space (such as a bounded subset of ℝ with the subspace metric) has totally bounded image, hence is bounded. So the Lean code’s comment states a corrected, different result.

Step 3: Final check: are the two problems the same?
- No. Differences:
  - Hypotheses: Lean requires E not closed; original requires only boundedness.
  - Conclusion: Lean produces f continuous on E but not uniformly continuous; original asks for f uniformly continuous and unbounded on E.
  - They are essentially opposites regarding uniform continuity, and the boundedness conclusion is unrelated in the Lean statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the statement is legitimate but not a translation of the given natural language claim.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

  Natural language: Given any family of topologies `T_α` on `X`, there exists a topology `t` on `X` such that for every subset `U` of `X`, `U` is open in `t` if and only if `U` is open in every `T i`. This exactly specifies `t` as the intersection of the family of topologies.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
The natural language statement says: If `T_α` is a family of topologies on `X`, show that the intersection `⋂ T_α` is a topology on `X`. The Lean statement asserts the existence of a topology `t` on `X` whose open sets are precisely those sets open in every `T i`. This is precisely the formal characterization of the intersection of a family of topologies, hence it states that the intersection is itself a topology.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: `ι` in Lean corresponds to `α` in the statement; both are arbitrary index types.
- Content: The equivalence `IsOpen in t ↔ ∀ i, IsOpen in T i` exactly captures the intersection notion. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. There are no extra or missing conditions.
- Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {k : ℕ}` and `variable {E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)}`: We fix a natural number k and a subset E of (Fin k → ℝ). In Mathlib, (Fin k → ℝ) is the standard model for ℝ^k.
- `def condensation_set : Set (Fin k → ℝ) := { x | ∀ ε, 0 < ε → Set.Uncountable (E ∩ Metric.ball x ε) }`: Define the set of condensation points of E to be those x in ℝ^k such that for every ε > 0, the open ball around x of radius ε contains uncountably many points of E (i.e., E ∩ ball(x, ε) is uncountable). This matches the usual definition: every neighborhood of x contains uncountably many points of E; in a metric space it suffices to check open balls.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Rudin_exercise_2_27a (hE : Set.Uncountable E) : IsClosed (condensation_set : Set (Fin k → ℝ)) ∧ ∀ x ∈ condensation_set, x ∈ closure (condensation_set \ {x}) := by sorry`.
  This says: assuming E is uncountable, the condensation set is closed and every point x of the condensation set lies in the closure of the condensation set with x removed. The conjunction of these two properties is exactly the standard characterization of a perfect set (closed and with no isolated points).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Suppose E ⊆ ℝ^k is uncountable, and let P be the set of condensation points of E. Prove that P is perfect.”
- The code defines P (named condensation_set) exactly as the set of condensation points of E using open balls in ℝ^k. It then asserts that, under the hypothesis that E is uncountable, P is closed and has no isolated points, i.e., is perfect. This is a faithful formalization. Using (Fin k → ℝ) for ℝ^k is standard in Mathlib and does not change the content.

3) Final check for differences:
- Ambient space: (Fin k → ℝ) vs ℝ^k — equivalent formalization.
- Definition of condensation points: via open balls — equivalent to neighborhood-based definition in metric spaces.
- Perfectness: expressed as “IsClosed P ∧ ∀ x ∈ P, x ∈ closure (P \ {x})” — this is the standard Mathlib formulation of “closed and no isolated points.” The statement does not require nonemptiness, which is consistent with many definitions; Rudin’s exercise only claims perfectness, not nonemptiness, so this matches.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The theorem proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set` are standard imports/openings; nothing special.
- The comment restates the natural language problem.
- `theorem isOpen_of_open_subset_extracted {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X} : (∀ x ∈ A, ∃ U ∈ 𝓝 x, U ⊆ A) → IsOpen A := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let X be a topological space and A ⊆ X. If for every x ∈ A there exists a set U with U ∈ 𝓝 x (i.e., U is a neighborhood of x) and U ⊆ A, then A is open.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The original hypothesis: for each x ∈ A, there exists an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ A.
- The Lean hypothesis: for each x ∈ A, there exists a set U with U ∈ 𝓝 x and U ⊆ A. In Mathlib, `U ∈ 𝓝 x` means U is a neighborhood of x, i.e., there exists an open V with x ∈ V and V ⊆ U. Thus the existence of such a U is equivalent to the existence of an open set V containing x with V ⊆ A. Conversely, if there is an open U containing x with U ⊆ A, then U ∈ 𝓝 x and the Lean hypothesis holds. Hence the Lean hypothesis is equivalent to the natural language hypothesis.
- Conclusion: `IsOpen A` matches “A is open in X”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement alone encodes the problem. Using neighborhoods is a standard and faithful formalization of the given criterion for openness.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically equivalent and thus the translation is faithful.

- Hypothesis `h : ∑ i : Fin (n+1), C i / ((i : ℝ) + 1) = 0` states that the sum over i = 0..n of C_i divided by (i+1) equals 0, exactly matching C_0 + C_1/2 + ... + C_n/(n+1) = 0.
- Conclusion: `∃ x : ℝ, 0 < x ∧ x < 1 ∧ (∑ i : Fin (n+1), C i * x ^ (i : ℕ)) = 0` asserts there exists a real number x with 0 < x < 1 such that the polynomial sum ∑_{i=0}^n C_i x^i equals 0. This is precisely the statement that the polynomial has a real root in the open interval (0,1).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Coefficients are real constants: matched by `C : Fin (n+1) → ℝ`.
- The condition C_0 + C_1/2 + ... + C_n/(n+1) = 0 is exactly captured by the sum `∑ C i / (i+1) = 0` with i running from 0 to n.
- The conclusion “at least one real root between 0 and 1” is expressed as the existence of x with `0 < x ∧ x < 1` satisfying the polynomial equation, matching the common interpretation of “between 0 and 1” as the open interval (0,1).

3) Final comparison and potential discrepancies:
- Indexing via `Fin (n+1)` faithfully models indices 0 through n.
- Denominators `(i : ℝ) + 1` correctly realize 1, 2, ..., n+1.
- The polynomial is written as a finite sum `∑ C i * x^(i)`, exactly C_0 + C_1 x + ... + C_n x^n.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given.
- The only subtlety is whether “between 0 and 1” means (0,1) or possibly includes endpoints. The code asserts existence in (0,1), which is the standard interpretation of “between.” Even if one allowed endpoints, the Lean statement is a slightly stronger conclusion, which is acceptable under the guidelines.

Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Uses Mathlib, so standard real analysis notions (continuity, derivative, monotone) are available.
- The theorem Rudin_exercise_5_6 is stated for functions f, f' : ℝ → ℝ.
- (h_cont : ContinuousOn f (Ici 0)): f is continuous on [0, ∞), i.e., for x ≥ 0.
- (h_der : ∀ x, 0 < x → HasDerivAt f (f' x) x): For every x > 0, the derivative of f at x exists and equals f'(x). This formalizes “f'(x) exists for x > 0,” with f' serving as the derivative function on (0, ∞).
- (h0 : f 0 = 0): f(0) = 0.
- (h_mono : Monotone f'): The function f' is monotone increasing on ℝ (global monotonicity).
- Conclusion: MonotoneOn (fun x => f x / x) (Ioi 0): The function g(x) = f(x)/x is monotonically increasing on (0, ∞).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumptions are:
  (a) f is continuous for x ≥ 0 → matches ContinuousOn f (Ici 0).
  (b) f'(x) exists for x > 0 → matches HasDerivAt f (f' x) x for x > 0.
  (c) f(0) = 0 → matches h0.
  (d) f' is monotonically increasing → in the usual reading, this means monotone on (0, ∞). The code assumes Monotone f' on all ℝ, which is a slightly stronger hypothesis than necessary. However, the derivative equality to f' is only required for x > 0, so outside (0, ∞) f' is just an auxiliary function. The conclusion only concerns (0, ∞). This is a mild strengthening of an assumption, not a change of the problem.
- The conclusion “Put g(x) = f(x)/x (x > 0) and prove that g is monotonically increasing” is exactly captured by MonotoneOn (fun x => f x / x) (Ioi 0).

Checks and potential red flags:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; all terms used are from Mathlib and standard.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the task since we are only checking the statement/translation.
- The only discrepancy is the global monotonicity assumption on f' instead of monotonicity on (0, ∞). This is a slight strengthening of the hypothesis, not a misuse or vacuous definition.

Final assessment:
- The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with a minor strengthening of one hypothesis (Monotone f' globally instead of on (0, ∞)). According to the guidelines, such slight specialization/strengthening is acceptable. Therefore it passes as faithful, though not perfectly exact.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard library, including `TopologicalSpace` and its order structure.
- `theorem exists_unique_smallest_topology {α : Type _} {X : Type _} (T : α → TopologicalSpace X) : ...` introduces a family of topologies `T` on `X`, indexed by `α`.
- The statement `∃! (t0 : TopologicalSpace X), (∀ a, T a ≤ t0) ∧ (∀ t' : TopologicalSpace X, (∀ a, T a ≤ t') → t0 ≤ t')` says: There exists a unique topology `t0` on `X` such that (i) for all `a`, `T a ≤ t0` (i.e., `t0` contains every `T a`), and (ii) for any topology `t'` that contains all `T a` (i.e., `∀ a, T a ≤ t'`), we have `t0 ≤ t'` (i.e., `t0` is the smallest among those containing all `T a`). The `∃!` quantifier encodes uniqueness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks for a unique smallest topology on `X` containing all the `T_α`. In Mathlib's order on `TopologicalSpace X`, `t ≤ t'` means `t` is coarser (its opens are included in those of `t'`), so “t' contains t”. Thus `(∀ a, T a ≤ t0)` expresses that `t0` contains all `T a`, and the minimality condition `(∀ t', (∀ a, T a ≤ t') → t0 ≤ t')` states `t0` is the smallest such topology. Uniqueness is explicitly required by `∃!`. This matches exactly the mathematical statement (the join/supremum of the family in the poset of topologies).

3) Final check:
- Same objects: a family of topologies on `X`.
- Same claim: existence and uniqueness of the smallest topology containing them.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it uses standard Mathlib notions.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is about the statement translation, which is correct.
Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization.

- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: Work with arbitrary types X and Y equipped with topological space structures.
- `def is_open_map (f : X → Y) : Prop := ∀ U : Set X, IsOpen U → IsOpen (f '' U)`: Define “f is an open map” to mean: for every open subset U of X, the image f(U) is open in Y. This matches the standard definition of an open map.

- `theorem snd_is_open_map : is_open_map (Prod.snd : X × Y → Y) := by sorry`: State that the second projection π₂ from the product X × Y to Y is an open map.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language defines open maps and asks to show that the projections π₁ and π₂ are open. The code mirrors this precisely: it gives the definition of open map (faithfully) and states the two projection theorems. The use of `f '' U` is the standard image. The topological assumptions are exactly as needed. Although Mathlib already has `IsOpenMap`, the custom `is_open_map` here is definitionally equivalent to the standard notion, so the translation remains faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is using a custom predicate name (`is_open_map`) instead of Mathlib's `IsOpenMap`. Its content matches the standard definition, so this is not a substantive difference.
- No extra assumptions or constraints are introduced; the statements are exactly those requested.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorems are left with `sorry` proofs, which is acceptable for translation assessment per the instructions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, where standard topology structures and notations live.
- Comment explains the exercise: compare the lower limit (Sorgenfrey) topology and the K-topology on ℝ.
- theorem lower_limit_and_K_top_not_comparable : ¬ (lower_limit_topology ℝ ≤ K_topology ℝ) ∧ ¬ (K_topology ℝ ≤ lower_limit_topology ℝ) := by sorry
  This asserts that neither of the two topologies is below the other in the partial order on topologies (where T ≤ U means every T-open set is U-open). Equivalently, the two topologies are not comparable. The proof is omitted via sorry, which is acceptable here as we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that the lower limit topology ℝ_l and K-topology ℝ_K are not comparable.”
- The Lean statement: “¬ (lower_limit_topology ℝ ≤ K_topology ℝ) ∧ ¬ (K_topology ℝ ≤ lower_limit_topology ℝ).” This is precisely the formal expression of “not comparable.”
- The code uses standard order on topologies: T ≤ U means U is finer than T. So the conjunction of the negations exactly states neither is finer than the other.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem directly states the desired relation. The identifiers for the two topologies are assumed to be provided by Mathlib (as per the premise that the code compiles), matching the described constructions.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorem states exactly that ℝ_l and ℝ_K are not comparable. No extra conditions or restrictions are added, and no generalization/specialization is introduced. The basis descriptions in the comment match the standard definitions, but the theorem relies on Mathlib’s existing definitions, which is appropriate.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Parameters: a : ℝ; f, f', f'' : ℝ → ℝ.
- hder1: ∀ x, a < x → HasDerivAt f (f' x) x. This says f is differentiable at every x > a with derivative f'(x); i.e., f is differentiable on (a, ∞) and f' is its derivative there.
- hder2: ∀ x, a < x → HasDerivAt (fun x => f' x) (f'' x) x. This says f' is differentiable at every x > a with derivative f''(x); i.e., f is twice differentiable on (a, ∞) and f'' is the second derivative there.
- M0, M1, M2 : ℝ.
- hM0: ∀ x, a < x → |f x| ≤ M0. So M0 is an upper bound for |f| on (a, ∞).
- hM1: ∀ x, a < x → |f' x| ≤ M1. So M1 is an upper bound for |f'| on (a, ∞).
- hM2: ∀ x, a < x → |f'' x| ≤ M2. So M2 is an upper bound for |f''| on (a, ∞).
- Conclusion: M1 ^ 2 ≤ 4 * M0 * M2.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Both require a ∈ ℝ and f real-valued, twice differentiable on (a, ∞). The code captures this accurately via HasDerivAt assumptions.
- The natural language specifies M0, M1, M2 are the least upper bounds (suprema) of |f|, |f'|, |f''| on (a, ∞). The Lean code only assumes M0, M1, M2 are some upper bounds, not necessarily least upper bounds.
- The conclusion M1^2 ≤ 4 M0 M2 matches in form.

Step 3: Are the two problems the same?
- Critical difference: ""least upper bounds"" vs. arbitrary upper bounds. The Lean statement asserts the inequality for any upper bounds M0, M1, M2, which is a strictly stronger claim than the original (and, in fact, false in general).
- Counterexample demonstrating the Lean statement can fail: take f ≡ 0 on (a, ∞). Then |f|, |f'|, |f''| are all 0. Choose M0 = 0, M2 = 0 (valid upper bounds), and choose M1 = 10 (also a valid upper bound for |f'| = 0). The conclusion would assert 100 ≤ 0, which is false.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is not a faithful translation: it omits the “least” part and thus becomes an incorrect strengthening.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the differentiability and bounds are expressed legitimately. However, the key omission about least upper bounds makes the translation unfaithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_21_6a` takes as input a real number `x : ℝ` together with hypotheses `hx : 0 ≤ x` and `hx' : x ≤ 1`. This encodes that `x ∈ [0,1]`.
- The conclusion is `∃ L : ℝ, Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => x ^ n) atTop (nhds L)`. This states that there exists a real number `L` such that the sequence `n ↦ x^n` tends to `L` as `n` goes to infinity (with `atTop` on `ℕ`), i.e., the sequence converges.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; it directly states the convergence claim in standard Mathlib terms (`Tendsto`, `atTop`, `nhds`).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines `f_n:[0,1] → ℝ` by `f_n(x) = x^n` and asks to show that the sequence `(f_n(x))` converges for each `x ∈ [0,1]`.
- The Lean statement, for an arbitrary but fixed `x ∈ [0,1]`, asserts the existence of `L` such that `x^n → L`. This is exactly the formal version of “the sequence (f_n(x)) converges for each x in [0,1]”.
- The code does not explicitly package `f_n` as a family of functions on the subtype `[0,1]`, but instead handles a fixed `x` with the inequalities. This is a standard and faithful way to formalize the same content.
- Domain and codomain match (real numbers), and the notion of convergence used (`Tendsto ... nhds L`) is the standard topological limit for real sequences.

Final check:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the theorem is a direct, faithful formalization of the statement.
- There is no discrepancy in meaning; minor formalization differences (subtype vs. inequalities) are routine and do not change the content.
- Therefore, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- The theorem statement: `theorem isPathConnected_of_isConnected_open_extracted {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [LocPathConnectedSpace X] {s : Set X} : IsConnected s → IsOpen s → IsPathConnected s := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X with a topology, assuming X is locally path connected (`[LocPathConnectedSpace X]`), and for any subset `s ⊆ X`, if `s` is connected (`IsConnected s`) and open in X (`IsOpen s`), then `s` is path connected (`IsPathConnected s`). In Mathlib, `IsConnected s` and `IsPathConnected s` are properties of the subspace topology on `s`, which aligns with the usual meaning of connected/path connected open subsets.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Let X be locally path connected. Show that every connected open set in X is path connected.""
- Lean: Exactly asserts that in a locally path connected space X, any open connected subset `s` is path connected.
- No extra assumptions or weakenings; the quantification over all `s` is explicit. The openness and connectedness are with respect to X, and the conclusion is path connectedness of the subspace, matching the natural language.

3) Final check for discrepancies:

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter Topology`: Use Mathlib and open namespaces for filters and topology.
- `variable {ι : Type*} {β : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (β i)]`: Fix an index type ι, a family of types β i indexed by ι, and assume each β i has a topology. This equips the product Π i, β i with the product topology.
- The theorem `sequence_tendsto_pi_iff {f : ℕ → ∀ i, β i} {x : ∀ i, β i} : Tendsto f atTop (𝓝 x) ↔ ∀ i, Tendsto (fun n => (f n) i) atTop (𝓝 (x i))` states: For a sequence f: ℕ → Π i, β i and a point x in the product, the sequence f converges to x (with respect to the product topology) if and only if for each coordinate i, the coordinate sequence n ↦ (f n) i converges to x i in β i.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: A sequence (x₁, x₂, …) in the product space ∏ X_α converges to x iff for each α the sequence π_α(x_i) converges to π_α(x).
- The Lean statement matches exactly: f is the sequence (x_i), the product is Π i, β i, convergence is Tendsto f atTop (𝓝 x), and coordinate convergence is Tendsto (π_i ∘ f) atTop (𝓝 (x i)). The universal quantifier over i corresponds to “for each α”.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given (proof omitted by `sorry`, which is allowed for this task).
- The index notation (ι vs α) and product notation (Π vs ∏) are conventional and equivalent here.
- The topology used is the standard product topology implicit in mathlib’s Pi type instance.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_2 (a b : ℝ) {f : ℝ → ℝ} (h : a < b) (hd : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Ioo a b)) (hpos : ∀ x ∈ Ioo a b, 0 < deriv f x) :` 
  Assumptions: a and b are real numbers with a < b; f : ℝ → ℝ is differentiable on the open interval (a, b); and the derivative of f is strictly positive at every point x in (a, b).
- Conclusion part 1: `StrictMonoOn f (Ioo a b)` means f is strictly increasing on the interval (a, b).
- Conclusion part 2: `∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ x ∈ Ioo a b, g (f x) = x) ∧ DifferentiableOn ℝ g (f '' Ioo a b) ∧ ∀ x ∈ Ioo a b, deriv g (f x) = (deriv f x)⁻¹`
  There exists a function g : ℝ → ℝ such that: 
  - For all x in (a, b), g(f(x)) = x (so g is a left inverse of f on (a, b), i.e., the inverse on the image).
  - g is differentiable on the set f((a, b)).
  - For all x in (a, b), the derivative of g at the point f(x) equals the reciprocal of the derivative of f at x; i.e., g'(f(x)) = 1 / f'(x).

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The hypothesis “f'(x) > 0 on (a, b)” is encoded as `∀ x ∈ Ioo a b, 0 < deriv f x` together with `DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Ioo a b)`. In typical mathematical language, saying f'(x) > 0 implicitly includes differentiability, so the Lean statement is a faithful and slightly more explicit formalization.
- The conclusion that f is strictly increasing on (a, b) matches `StrictMonoOn f (Ioo a b)`.
- “Let g be its inverse function” is captured by the existence of a function g with `g (f x) = x` for all x in (a, b). While the code only states the left-inverse property, on the set f((a, b)) this is exactly the usual inverse one uses; and combined with strict monotonicity/injectivity it indeed is the inverse on that image. This is sufficient for the derivative claim.
- “Prove that g is differentiable” is stated as `DifferentiableOn ℝ g (f '' Ioo a b)`, i.e. differentiable on the image—the natural domain of the inverse. 
- The derivative identity `g'(f(x)) = 1 / f'(x)` is exactly `deriv g (f x) = (deriv f x)⁻¹` for all x in (a, b).

Step 3: Final comparison and any differences
- Minor formalization differences:
  - The explicit differentiability assumption `hd` is a standard formal counterpart to the informal “f'(x) > 0”.
  - The code quantifies an ℝ → ℝ function g but restricts its differentiability and inverse property to the natural domain f((a, b)); this aligns with the informal statement.
  - The use of multiplicative inverse `(deriv f x)⁻¹` is equivalent to `1 / f'(x)` in ℝ.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The statement directly matches the mathematics of the original problem.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language and assess it.
- import Mathlib / open Set / variable {X : Type _}: Set up the environment and a type X.

- def is_topology (T : Set (Set X)) : Prop := ...: This defines when a collection T of subsets of X is a topology: it contains ∅ and X, is closed under finite intersections (binary intersection suffices), and is closed under arbitrary unions (expressed via sUnion of any subfamily 𝒞 ⊆ T). This matches the standard axioms for a topology.

- def is_basis (B : Set (Set X)) : Prop := ...: This defines a basis on X (without reference to a prior topology) with the two standard axioms: coverage (every x ∈ X lies in some B ∈ B) and the intersection axiom (for any b1, b2 ∈ B and any x ∈ b1 ∩ b2, there exists b3 ∈ B with x ∈ b3 ⊆ b1 ∩ b2). This is a standard, equivalent formulation of a topological basis.

- def topology_from_basis (B : Set (Set X)) : Set (Set X) := { U | ∃ 𝒞 : Set (Set X), 𝒞 ⊆ B ∧ U = sUnion 𝒞 }: This defines the collection of all unions of elements of B. If B satisfies is_basis, this set is indeed a topology and is the topology generated by B.

- def topology_generated_by_intersection (B : Set (Set X)) : Set (Set X) := sInter { T | is_topology T ∧ B ⊆ T }: This is the intersection of all topologies on X that contain B (i.e., in which every element of B is open). This is the minimal topology containing B.

- theorem Munkres_exercise_13_5a (B : Set (Set X)) (h : is_basis B) : topology_from_basis B = topology_generated_by_intersection B := by sorry: The statement asserts that if B is a basis, then the topology consisting of unions of basis elements equals the intersection of all topologies containing B. This is precisely the desired equality.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: ""Show that if A is a basis for a topology on X, then the topology generated by A equals the intersection of all topologies on X that contain A."" The Lean code defines both interpretations of ""topology generated by A"": as unions of basis elements and as intersection of all topologies containing A, assumes A is a basis, and states their equality. This matches exactly.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code uses precise, non-vacuous definitions for topology and basis.
- It does not rely on placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are legitimate.
- It states the equality under the hypothesis that B is a basis, just as in the natural language statement.
- Minor implementation detail: it treats topologies as sets of subsets rather than as a TopologicalSpace structure, which is appropriate and faithful to the set-theoretic statement.
No substantive discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We fix a topological space X.
- `variable (A : ℕ → Set X)`: We have a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of subsets A n of X.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_23_2 (h_conn : ∀ n, IsConnected (A n)) (h_nz : ∀ n, ∃ x, x ∈ A n ∧ x ∈ A (n+1)) : IsConnected (⋃ n, A n) := by sorry`
  • Hypothesis `h_conn : ∀ n, IsConnected (A n)`: each A n is connected (as a subspace/subset with the induced topology).
  • Hypothesis `h_nz : ∀ n, ∃ x, x ∈ A n ∧ x ∈ A (n+1)`: for every n, there exists a point in the intersection A n ∩ A (n+1), i.e., the consecutive intersections are nonempty.
  • Conclusion: `IsConnected (⋃ n, A n)`: the union over all n of A n is connected.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let {A_n} be a sequence of connected subspaces of X, such that A_n ∩ A_{n+1} ≠ ∅ for all n. Show that ⋃ A_n is connected.
- The Lean code precisely encodes:
  • A sequence A : ℕ → Set X.
  • Each A n is connected: `IsConnected (A n)` is the standard Mathlib notion of connected subset (in the subspace topology), matching ""connected subspace"".
  • Nonempty consecutive intersections: `∃ x, x ∈ A n ∧ x ∈ A (n+1)` is exactly A_n ∩ A_{n+1} ≠ ∅.
  • Goal: `IsConnected (⋃ n, A n)`, i.e., the union over all n is connected.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is allowed for this task.

3) Final check of differences:
- Indexing starts at ℕ in Lean; the natural language uses n as a sequence index, which is standard. Whether starting at 0 or 1 is immaterial here.
- Mathlib’s IsConnected for sets includes nonemptiness; however, the hypothesis about nonempty intersections already forces nonemptiness of each A n, so there is no mismatch.
- Treating subspaces as subsets with the induced topology is standard; thus ""connected subspaces"" is faithfully represented by `IsConnected (A n)`.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Equivalently, the space α is uncountable.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- Assumptions match: metric space + connectedness + more than one point.
- Conclusion matches: uncountable, formalized as `¬ Set.Countable (univ : Set α)`, which is the standard set-level notion of uncountable in Mathlib and is equivalent to saying the space is uncountable.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with `sorry` proof placeholder (allowed for checking translation faithfulness).

3) Final comparison:

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- `variables {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]` introduces two topological spaces X and Y.
- `variable {A : Set X} {B : Set Y}` introduces subsets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_23_9` assumes:
  - `hA : A ≠ (univ : Set X)` meaning A is a proper subset of X (not equal to the whole space).
  - `hB : B ≠ (univ : Set Y)` meaning B is a proper subset of Y.
  - `hX : ConnectedSpace X` and `hY : ConnectedSpace Y` meaning X and Y are connected spaces.
- The conclusion is `IsConnected ((univ : Set (X × Y)) \ (A ×ˢ B))`, i.e., the set (X × Y) \ (A × B) is connected as a subspace of X × Y. Here `×ˢ` is the set product, and `(univ : Set (X × Y))` denotes the whole product space treated as a set.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let A be a proper subset of X, and B a proper subset of Y. If X and Y are connected, show that (X × Y) − (A × B) is connected.
- Proper subset is captured by `A ≠ univ` and `B ≠ univ`.
- Connectedness of X and Y is captured by `ConnectedSpace X` and `ConnectedSpace Y`.
- The set in question is exactly `(univ : Set (X × Y)) \ (A ×ˢ B)`, i.e., the complement of A × B in X × Y.
- `IsConnected` is the standard notion of connectedness for subsets in mathlib, matching the intended meaning.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem statement precisely matches the natural language statement in content and level of generality.
- Using `(univ : Set (X × Y)) \ (A ×ˢ B)` is the standard Lean rendering of (X × Y) − (A × B).
- No extraneous assumptions are added; all necessary ones are present.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def rational_open_interval_basis : Set (Set ℝ) := { I | ∃ a b : ℚ, (a : ℝ) < (b : ℝ) ∧ I = Ioo (a : ℝ) (b : ℝ) }`
  This defines the collection of all subsets of ℝ that are open intervals (a,b) with rational endpoints a,b and a < b. This exactly matches the collection {(a,b) | a<b, a and b rational}.

- `def lower_limit_basis : Set (Set ℝ) := { I | ∃ a b : ℝ, a < b ∧ I = Ico a b }`
  This defines the usual lower limit (Sorgenfrey) basis on ℝ: all half-open intervals [a,b) with real endpoints a < b.

- `theorem rational_open_intervals_is_basis : IsTopologicalBasis rational_open_interval_basis := by sorry`
  This asserts that the collection of rational open intervals forms a topological basis for the existing topology on ℝ (the standard Euclidean topology). While the natural language statement only needs that this collection is a basis (for some topology), showing it is a topological basis for the standard topology is a standard strengthening and is consistent with the intent.

- `theorem generated_topology_differs_from_lower_limit : TopologicalSpace.generateFrom rational_open_interval_basis ≠ TopologicalSpace.generateFrom lower_limit_basis := by sorry`
  This asserts that the topology generated by the rational-open-interval collection is different from the topology generated by the lower-limit basis, i.e., different from the lower limit topology. This directly matches the claim that the topology generated by the rational open interval collection differs from the lower limit topology on ℝ.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The code correctly defines the collection {(a,b) | a<b, a,b rational}.
- It asserts that this collection is a topological basis (indeed for the standard topology), which satisfies the ""is a basis"" part (and is even stronger).
- It also asserts that the topology generated by this collection is different from the lower limit topology, matching the second part of the statement.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; both collections are concretely defined via Mathlib primitives (Ioo and Ico). The use of `sorry` is acceptable as the task is about faithful translation, not providing proofs. The topologies being compared are exactly those intended: generateFrom of the rational open interval family vs. generateFrom of the lower limit basis family.

Final check: The two math problems are the same. The Lean code captures precisely the intended definitions and claims, with a harmless strengthening that the rational open intervals form a basis for the standard topology (which is compatible with the overall goal).

- The theorem `exists_disjoint_nhds_of_closed (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [NormalSpace X] {A B : Set X} (hA : IsClosed A) (hB : IsClosed B) (hd : Disjoint A B) : ∃ U V : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V ∧ A ⊆ U ∧ B ⊆ V ∧ Disjoint (closure U) (closure V)` states: For a type X with a topology and which is a normal space, for any closed sets A and B in X that are disjoint, there exist sets U and V that are open, such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V (so U and V are open neighborhoods of A and B), and the closures of U and V are disjoint.
- The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear and non-vacuous; there are no auxiliary definitions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Show that if X is normal, every pair of disjoint closed sets have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint.""
- Lean: Assumes X is a NormalSpace, A and B are closed and disjoint, and concludes there exist open neighborhoods U of A and V of B whose closures are disjoint. This is exactly the desired statement, even slightly stronger because it specifies the neighborhoods are open.

3) Final check:
- Both statements assert: In a normal space, disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighborhoods with disjoint closures. The Lean version makes the neighborhoods explicitly open, which is standard and stronger. No discrepancies or vacuous placeholders. No extra unintended restrictions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- The theorem `exists_antipodal_eq {f : {x : ℝ × ℝ // x.1 ^ 2 + x.2 ^ 2 = 1} → ℝ} (hf : Continuous f) : ∃ x, f x = f (-x)` states: For a continuous function `f` from the unit circle in ℝ² (as a subtype) to ℝ, there exists a point `x` on the circle such that `f x = f (-x)`. Here `-x` is the antipodal point (negation in ℝ², restricted to the circle). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this translation audit.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Let f : S¹ → ℝ be continuous; show ∃ x ∈ S¹ with f(x) = f(−x).
- Lean: Exactly the same, with S¹ instantiated as the unit circle `{x : ℝ × ℝ // x.1^2 + x.2^2 = 1}` and the antipodal map `x ↦ -x` from the ambient ℝ² restricted to the circle. The continuity hypothesis `Continuous f` is present.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only difference is the concrete representation of S¹ as a subtype of ℝ², which is a standard and faithful formalization.

- `theorem infinite_set_connected_in_finite_complement_topology {X : Type*} (t : TopologicalSpace X) (hX : Infinite X) (ht : finite_complement_topology t) : ConnectedSpace X := by sorry`
  This states: given a topology `t` on `X`, if `X` is infinite and `t` is the cofinite topology (as defined above), then `X` is a connected space (with respect to `t`). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is allowed since we are only auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: if `X` is an infinite set, it is connected in the finite complement topology. The Lean code formalizes exactly this: it assumes `X` is infinite and that the topology `t` on `X` is the finite-complement topology (via `ht`), and concludes that `X` is connected (`ConnectedSpace X`). The auxiliary definition `finite_complement_topology` is a faithful and standard characterization of the cofinite topology. There are no vacuous placeholders; the definition is substantive and correct.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language says ""in the finite complement topology""; the Lean code models this by taking an arbitrary topology `t` and assuming it satisfies the finite-complement condition. This is the precise formal counterpart.
- The conclusion `ConnectedSpace X` matches the intended notion of connectedness of `X` with respect to the topology `t`.
No meaningful discrepancies found. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:

- `(∃ S : Set X, S.Countable ∧ closure S = (univ : Set X)) →` If there exists a subset S of X that is countable and dense (since closure S = univ),
- `∀ (C : Set (Set X)),` then for every collection C of subsets of X (i.e., a set of open sets),

- `(∀ U V ∈ C, U ≠ V → Disjoint U V) →` and for any two distinct U, V in C, they are disjoint (pairwise disjointness),
- `C.Countable := by sorry` then C is countable.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that if X has a countable dense subset, every collection of disjoint open sets in X is countable."" This means: if X has a countable dense subset, then any (pairwise) disjoint family of open sets in X is countable.
- The Lean statement matches the structure: existence of a countable dense subset implies any pairwise disjoint family of open sets is countable.
- The only additional condition in Lean is `U ≠ ∅` for each U in the family. The natural statement did not explicitly exclude the empty set. However, allowing or excluding ∅ does not change countability of the family (there can be at most one empty set in a set of sets). Many standard formulations explicitly assume nonempty open sets in such results. This is a very mild specialization and does not materially alter the mathematical content.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions (`closure`, `Countable`, `IsOpen`, `Disjoint`). The presence of `by sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task, as we assess statement faithfulness, not the proof.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same core theorem: countable dense subset implies any pairwise disjoint family of open sets is countable.
- Slight specialization: Lean requires nonempty open sets. This does not affect the essence of the statement, since adding or removing the (at most one) empty set preserves countability. Thus it is essentially faithful, with a negligible difference.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful; minor nonemptiness restriction is acceptable.

- The theorem: `theorem regular_of_locallyCompact_hausdorff {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [LocallyCompactSpace X] [T2Space X] : RegularSpace X := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type X with a topology, if X is locally compact (`LocallyCompactSpace X`) and Hausdorff (`T2Space X`), then X is a regular space (`RegularSpace X`). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is clear.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is regular.""
- The Lean statement says precisely: for all X with a topological structure, if X is locally compact and Hausdorff, then X is a RegularSpace. This is exactly the same mathematical content.
- Possible convention nuance: In some texts, ""regular"" may or may not include T1. Mathlib's `RegularSpace` typically encodes the T1+regular (T3) condition. Since the hypothesis includes `T2Space` (Hausdorff), which implies T1, any potential discrepancy disappears; the conclusion is still faithful (indeed slightly stronger if a non-T1 definition were intended). This is acceptable and standard.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with standard Mathlib classes. The presence of `sorry` does not affect the translation audit, as we only assess the statement.

Final check:

  Natural language: For a type X equipped with a topology, and assuming X is completely regular, X is connected if and only if its Stone–Čech compactification StoneCech X is connected.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: Let X be completely regular. Show that X is connected iff the Stone–Čech compactification of X is connected.
- The Lean statement precisely encodes this: it assumes `[TopologicalSpace X]` and `[CompletelyRegularSpace X]`, and asserts `ConnectedSpace X ↔ ConnectedSpace (StoneCech X)`.
- `StoneCech X` is the Mathlib name for the Stone–Čech compactification of X, and `ConnectedSpace` is the predicate that the whole space is connected. This matches the intended meaning.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The assumptions match exactly (complete regularity of X), and the conclusion is an equivalence of connectedness between X and its Stone–Čech compactification.

- `variable {V : Type*} [AddGroup V]`: We consider an arbitrary type V equipped with an additive group structure. This ensures the operation of negation `-v` is defined.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that −(−v) = v for every v ∈ V.” The Lean statement precisely asserts this equality for all v in V. The only structural assumption made is that V is an additive group, which is sufficient to define negation and prove the identity.

3) Final check:

theorem Munkres_exercise_32_2b : RegularSpace (∀ i, X i) → ∀ i, RegularSpace (X i) := by sorry

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {ι : Type*} {X : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)] [∀ i, Nonempty (X i)]`
  This sets up an index type ι, a family of types X indexed by ι, equips each X i with a topological space structure, and assumes each X i is nonempty.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_32_2b : RegularSpace (∀ i, X i) → ∀ i, RegularSpace (X i) := by sorry`
  This asserts: If the product space Π i, X i (the dependent function type with the product topology) is regular, then for every index i, the space X i is regular. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement says: If the product ∏ X_α is regular, then each factor X_α is regular, assuming each X_α is nonempty. The Lean statement precisely mirrors this:
- The product ∏ X_α is represented by the Pi type `(∀ i, X i)` with the product topology.
- Regularity is expressed via `RegularSpace` on both the product and each factor.
- The nonemptiness assumption for each factor is included as `[∀ i, Nonempty (X i)]`.
Thus, the Lean theorem captures the exact content of the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with the appropriate hypotheses.
- The only potential nuance is the precise meaning of ""regular"". In Mathlib, `RegularSpace` denotes the standard notion of regularity (often distinguished from `T3Space`, which includes T1). The natural language does not explicitly specify inclusion of T1, and the exercise name suggests alignment with the standard notion used in Mathlib. Given this, the translation is appropriate and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology and which is a normal space, and any subset s of X that is closed, the subspace of X consisting of points in s (with the induced/subspace topology, represented by `Subtype s`) is a normal space.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- This exactly matches the statement: ""Show that a closed subspace of a normal space is normal."" Here, `s` being closed is `IsClosed s`, the ambient space X is assumed normal `[NormalSpace X]`, and the conclusion is that the subspace `Subtype s` is normal: `NormalSpace (Subtype s)`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code declares a single theorem with a `sorry` placeholder proof, which is acceptable for translation checking.
- Potential minor definitional nuance: In some texts (e.g., Munkres), ""normal"" includes T1. In Mathlib, `NormalSpace` is the standard normality separation property and T1 is a separate class; sometimes the combination is called T4. However, both the hypothesis and conclusion use the same notion (Mathlib’s `NormalSpace`), so the formal statement is a faithful rendition of the intended result. Per the guidelines, such minor definitional differences are acceptable.

Final check:
- The formal and natural language statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No discrepancies found.

  For any set S of submodules of V, there exists a submodule W of V such that the underlying set of W equals the intersection over all s in S of the underlying sets of s.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that the intersection of any collection of subspaces of V is a subspace of V."" The Lean statement asserts that for any collection S of submodules (subspaces) there exists a submodule whose carrier is exactly the set-theoretic intersection of all the carriers of the submodules in S. This is precisely the formalization of the claim that the intersection is itself a subspace. The context (vector spaces over a field) matches the usual meaning of ""subspace."" No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the only omission is the proof (replaced by `sorry`), which is acceptable per the task.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement handles arbitrary collections (including possibly empty), which is consistent with the natural language. For the empty collection, the intersection is the whole space, which is a subspace; the Lean formulation correctly captures this.
- The use of Submodule K V is exactly the mathlib notion of a subspace for a K-vector space. There is no mismatch or overgeneralization.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formal statement of the natural language claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_26_11 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]` sets up X as a compact Hausdorff topological space, matching the natural language.
- `(A : Set (Set X))` is a collection of subsets of X.
- `(h_nonempty : A.Nonempty)` assumes the collection A is nonempty. This is an extra assumption not explicitly stated in the natural language, but often intended for such results (without it, the intersection could be univ and the statement could fail unless X is connected).
- `(h_closed : ∀ S ∈ A, IsClosed (S : Set X))` says each member of A is closed. This matches.
- `(h_connected : ∀ S ∈ A, IsPreconnected (S : Set X))` says each S is preconnected, not connected. In Mathlib, “IsConnected S” = “S.Nonempty ∧ IsPreconnected S”. So this is weaker than “connected” as usually stated, since it drops nonemptiness; Munkres typically considers empty set connected, but Lean’s connectedness requires nonempty. This is a mismatch in terminology/strength.
- `(h_total_order : ∀ S T ∈ A, S ⊂ T ∨ T ⊂ S)` intends to encode “simply ordered by proper inclusion”, but as written it requires for all S, T in A (including S = T) that S ⊂ T or T ⊂ S. Since strict inclusion is false when S = T, this hypothesis is impossible for any nonempty A. The intended formalization should be something like: for all S, T ∈ A, S ⊆ T ∨ T ⊆ S, and if S ≠ T then S ⊂ T ∨ T ⊂ S; or equivalently, a linear order by ⊆ and strictness when distinct. As written, the hypothesis is too strong and inconsistent with `h_nonempty`.
- Conclusion: `IsPreconnected (⋂₀ A)`. This asserts preconnectedness of the intersection, not connectedness. The natural statement asserts “connectedness” of Y. In Mathlib, that would be `IsConnected (⋂₀ A)`. So the conclusion is strictly weaker.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Correct: X compact Hausdorff; A is a family of closed subsets; the intersection considered is `⋂₀ A`.
- Differences:
  1) Connected vs preconnected: The code assumes each member is preconnected and concludes the intersection is preconnected, whereas the natural language states connected subsets and concludes the intersection is connected. In Mathlib terms, they weakened both hypotheses and conclusion by dropping nonemptiness. This is not faithful.
  2) Order condition: The code imposes `∀ S T ∈ A, S ⊂ T ∨ T ⊂ S` unconditionally, which is impossible if A has any element (taking S = T). The intended “simply ordered by proper inclusion” means: for S ≠ T, either S ⊂ T or T ⊂ S. The formalization is incorrect and overly strong.
  3) Extra assumption: `A.Nonempty` is added. This is a reasonable technical reinforcement often needed for the result to be meaningful, but it is an extra assumption relative to the literal statement.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem states a strictly weaker conclusion (preconnectedness instead of connectedness) and uses a fundamentally incorrect total order assumption (strict inclusion for all pairs, including equal ones), making the hypotheses inconsistent with nonemptiness. Thus it is not a faithful translation of the natural statement.

The code replaces the hypothesis ""dim V = 1"" with an equivalent characterization: the existence of a nonzero vector v0 such that every v is a scalar multiple of v0. Over a field, this is exactly the condition that V has a basis of one vector, hence dim V = 1. The conclusion matches precisely: ∃ a ∈ 𝕜, ∀ v, T v = a • v.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We work in a topological space X.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_29_10 (x : X) (hT2 : T2Space X) (hloc : ∃ K : Set X, IsCompact K ∧ x ∈ interior K) :` assumes a point x in X, that X is Hausdorff (T2), and that there exists a compact set K whose interior contains x. This last hypothesis is a standard formulation of “X is locally compact at x.”
- Conclusion: `∀ U : Set X, x ∈ interior U → ∃ V : Set X, x ∈ interior V ∧ IsCompact (closure V) ∧ closure V ⊆ U`. For every set U that is a neighborhood of x (encoded as x ∈ interior U), there exists a set V that is also a neighborhood of x (x ∈ interior V) such that the closure of V is compact and contained in U.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Hausdorff: Encoded by `T2Space X` (hypothesis `hT2`).
- “Locally compact at x”: Encoded as the existence of a compact set K with x in its interior. This is a standard equivalent formulation of local compactness at a point (and is acceptable here, especially in the Hausdorff context).
- “For each neighborhood U of x”: Encoded as quantifying over sets U with `x ∈ interior U`.
- “There is a neighborhood V of x such that closure V is compact and closure V ⊆ U”: Encoded exactly as `∃ V, x ∈ interior V ∧ IsCompact (closure V) ∧ closure V ⊆ U`.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement matches the English statement precisely in mathematical meaning. The use of `x ∈ interior U` to define neighborhoods is standard. The assumption expressing local compactness at x is a standard equivalent formulation and is legitimate. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. No extra or missing conditions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in Mathlib.
- `theorem retraction_is_quotient {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X}` sets up a topological space X and a subset A of X.
- `(r : X → A) (hr : Continuous r) (hretract : ∀ a : A, r a = a)` means r is a map from X to the subtype A (with the subspace topology), r is continuous, and r restricts to the identity on A (i.e., for every a in A, r(a) = a as elements of the subtype).
- `: ∀ U : Set A, IsOpen U ↔ IsOpen (r ⁻¹' U)` states that for every subset U of A (open in the subspace topology), U is open in A if and only if the preimage under r is open in X. This is the open set characterization of a quotient map.
- `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided, which is acceptable for this audit focusing on the statement/translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language defines a retraction as a continuous map r: X → A with r(a) = a for each a ∈ A, and asks to show such an r is a quotient map.
- The Lean statement assumes exactly those hypotheses (continuity and r|_A = id) and concludes the open set iff-preimage-open condition. This matches the standard characterization of a quotient map. Surjectivity is not explicitly stated in the conclusion, but given hretract, r is indeed surjective onto A (for any a ∈ A, r(a) = a), so the usual quotient map definition is satisfied. Moreover, the docstring clarifies that by “quotient map” they mean the iff property.
- The topology on A is the subspace topology via the subtype instance, so `IsOpen U` is interpreted correctly.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
- The two statements match: define a retraction and show it is a quotient map (expressed via the open set preimage equivalence). Any minor definitional nuances (surjectivity) are implicitly guaranteed by the retraction property. Thus the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_continuous_forall_eq_zero_of_closed_of_compact {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompletelyRegularSpace X] {A B : Set X} (hA : IsClosed A) (hB : IsClosed B) (hAB : Disjoint A B) (hA' : IsCompact A) :` 
  This sets up: X is a topological space and completely regular; A, B are subsets of X; A and B are closed and disjoint; A is compact.
- Conclusion: `∃ f : C(X, ℝ), ∀ x ∈ A, f x = 0 ∧ ∀ x ∈ B, f x = 1`.
  There exists a continuous function f: X → ℝ such that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ A and f(x) = 1 for all x ∈ B. Parentheses/precedence make this equivalent to (∀ x∈A, f x = 0) ∧ (∀ x∈B, f x = 1).
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; all notions are standard Mathlib.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses match: X completely regular; A, B closed, disjoint; A compact. Good.
- Conclusion in natural language: there exists a continuous f: X → [0,1] with f(A) = {0} and f(B) = {1}.
- Conclusion in Lean: there exists continuous f: X → ℝ with f = 0 on A and f = 1 on B, but no requirement that the image lies in [0,1]. So the codomain is ℝ, not the unit interval. This is strictly weaker than requiring f maps into [0,1].
- Also, the Lean statement uses pointwise equalities on A and B rather than the image equalities f(A) = {0} and f(B) = {1}. For nonempty A, B these are equivalent, but if A or B is empty, the image equality cannot hold (e.g., f(∅) = ∅ ≠ {0}), whereas the Lean conditions hold vacuously. The natural statement did not assume nonemptiness, so there is a mismatch at this edge case.

3) Final check: The Lean theorem is very close but not fully faithful. It misses the codomain restriction to [0,1] and uses pointwise equalities rather than the exact image equalities, which differ when A or B is empty. Therefore, the translation is not perfectly faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {K : Type*} [Field K]` introduces a field K.
- `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]` introduces a K-vector space V (no further assumptions like finite dimensionality needed).
- `open LinearMap` just opens the LinearMap namespace.
- `theorem Axler_exercise_5_12 (T : V →ₗ[K] V) (h : ∀ v : V, ∃ λ : K, T v = λ • v) : ∃ c : K, T = c • LinearMap.id := by sorry`
  This states: Let T be a K-linear endomorphism of V. Assume that for every v in V, there exists a scalar λ in K with T v = λ • v. Then there exists a scalar c in K such that T equals c times the identity linear map on V.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""Suppose T ∈ L(V) is such that every vector in V is an eigenvector of T. Prove that T is a scalar multiple of the identity operator."" In standard terminology, an eigenvector is nonzero and satisfies T v = λ v for some λ.
- The Lean hypothesis `∀ v, ∃ λ, T v = λ v` includes v = 0. This is a standard formalization choice: the condition at v = 0 is trivially satisfied (since T 0 = 0 = λ • 0 for any λ), and the interesting content is for nonzero v. Moreover, the Lean hypothesis is logically equivalent to the usual “every nonzero v is an eigenvector” because one can always choose some λ for v = 0, and conversely the Lean condition implies the nonzero case directly. Thus there is no substantive discrepancy here.
- The conclusion exactly matches: existence of c with T = c • id.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. The code uses standard Mathlib structures (Field, Module, LinearMap) and only states the theorem (with `sorry` as placeholder for proof, which is acceptable under the instructions).
- The theorem is stated in full generality (no finite-dimensional assumption), which is acceptable and faithful to the mathematical content, since the result holds in general.

3) Final check for differences:
- Only minor technical nuance: the Lean hypothesis quantifies over all v (including 0), while the natural-language notion of “eigenvector” excludes 0. This does not change the meaning, as explained; they are effectively equivalent in this context.
- Otherwise, the statements match exactly: linear operator on a vector space, every vector is an eigenvector, implies T is a scalar multiple of identity.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- import Mathlib; open Set: bring in Mathlib and open the Set namespace.
- variable (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X]: fix a topological space X.
- def CountablyCompactSpace : Prop := ∀ (ι : Type*) (U : ι → Set X), Countable ι → (∀ i, IsOpen (U i)) → (⋃ i, U i) = univ → ∃ t : Finset ι, (⋃ i ∈ t, U i) = univ
  Natural language: X is countably compact if for every countable index type ι and every family of open sets (U i) indexed by ι that covers X, there exists a finite subset t of indices such that the finite subunion still covers X. This is the standard definition of countable compactness (countable open covers have finite subcovers).
- theorem countably_compact_iff_nested_closed : CountablyCompactSpace X ↔ (∀ (C : ℕ → Set X), (∀ n, IsClosed (C n)) → (∀ n, C (n+1) ⊆ C n) → (∀ n, C n ≠ ∅) → (⋂ n, C n) ≠ ∅)
  Natural language: X is countably compact if and only if for every sequence (C n) of subsets of X such that each C n is closed, the sequence is nested decreasing (C_{n+1} ⊆ C_n), and each C n is nonempty, the intersection over all n of the C n is nonempty.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: ""Show that X is countably compact iff every nested sequence C1 ⊇ C2 ⊇ ... of closed nonempty sets of X has a nonempty intersection.""
- The Lean statement matches exactly: it uses a sequence indexed by ℕ, requires closedness, nestedness (via C(n+1) ⊆ C(n)), and nonemptiness of each term, concluding that the intersection is nonempty. The definition of countably compact matches the standard one (every countable open cover has a finite subcover).

3) Final comparison:
- The only cosmetic differences are indexing from ℕ starting at 0 rather than 1 (irrelevant) and using a general countable index type for covers (standard and equivalent). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary definition of CountablyCompactSpace is legitimate and faithful to the notion. The theorem statement is precisely the desired ""iff"" equivalence.
- Therefore, the code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {F : Type _} [Field F]` and `variable {V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]` set up a vector space V over a field F (in Mathlib, a vector space is an additive commutative group with a module structure over a field).
- `(S T : V →ₗ[F] V)` means S and T are linear endomorphisms on V, i.e., elements of L(V).
- `(h : S.comp T = T.comp S)` encodes the commutativity assumption ST = TS.
- `(λ : F)` introduces an arbitrary scalar λ in the field F.
- The statement `∀ v, (T - λ • LinearMap.id) v = 0 → (T - λ • LinearMap.id) (S v) = 0` says: for every vector v, if v is in the kernel of T - λ I (i.e., (T - λ I)v = 0), then S v is also in the kernel of T - λ I. This is exactly the definition that ker(T - λ I) is invariant under S (S maps the subspace ker(T - λ I) into itself).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If S, T ∈ L(V) with ST = TS, then for every λ ∈ F, the null space of T − λI is invariant under S.
- The Lean statement matches this precisely: it assumes S, T commute and concludes that for an arbitrary λ and all v, membership in ker(T − λI) implies the image under S stays in ker(T − λI). The use of `(T - λ • LinearMap.id)` is exactly T − λI. Expressing invariance via a pointwise implication is equivalent to the subspace inclusion S(ker(...)) ⊆ ker(...).
- There are no auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions; everything uses standard Mathlib constructs. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable here since we're evaluating the statement, not the proof.

Final check: The two statements are the same. No differences in meaning or generality.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_6_2 {𝕜 : Type*} [IsROrC 𝕜] {E : Type*} [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 E] {u v : E} : ...` sets up: 𝕜 is either ℝ or ℂ (`[IsROrC 𝕜]`), E is an inner product space over 𝕜, and u, v are vectors in E.
- The statement `inner u v = 0 ↔ ∀ a : 𝕜, ‖u‖ ≤ ‖u + a • v‖` exactly asserts: the inner product of u and v is zero if and only if for every scalar a in 𝕜, the norm of u is at most the norm of u + a v. The `•` denotes scalar multiplication. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we are auditing the statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let V be an inner product space over F, u, v ∈ V. Prove ⟨u, v⟩ = 0 iff ‖u‖ ≤ ‖u + a v‖ for all a ∈ F.

It quantifies over arbitrary vectors `u v : V`.
- `⟪u, v⟫ = ((‖u + v‖ ^ 2 - ‖u - v‖ ^ 2 + ‖u + Complex.I • v‖ ^ 2 * Complex.I - ‖u - Complex.I • v‖ ^ 2 * Complex.I) / 4)` is exactly the claimed identity: the complex inner product of `u` and `v` equals one quarter of the combination of squared norms: `‖u+v‖^2 - ‖u-v‖^2 + i‖u + iv‖^2 - i‖u - iv‖^2`. Here `Complex.I • v` denotes scalar multiplication of `v` by `i`, and `* Complex.I` denotes multiplication by `i` in ℂ. The division by `4` is in ℂ (with the reals coerced to ℂ where needed).
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but for this auditing task we only check the statement (translation), not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If V is a complex inner-product space, then ⟨u, v⟩ = (‖u+v‖^2 − ‖u−v‖^2 + ‖u+iv‖^2 i − ‖u−iv‖^2 i)/4 for all u, v in V.""
- Lean statement: Exactly the same identity, with precise Lean formalization of `u ± v`, `‖·‖^2`, `i v` as `Complex.I • v`, and the complex multiplications by `i` on the norm-squared terms, all divided by `4`.
- The assumptions match: `[InnerProductSpace ℂ V]` expresses that V is a complex inner product space. The extra `[NormedAddCommGroup V]` is redundant but compatible and does not change the meaning.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. No scope change or generalization/specialization beyond standard coercions. The formula matches the standard polarization identity for complex inner product spaces using Mathlib's convention (linear in the first argument). No discrepancies found.

  This states: For a field `K` that is either ℝ or ℂ (`[IsROrC K]`), and an inner product space `V` over `K` (`[InnerProductSpace K V]`), additionally assuming `V` is finite-dimensional (`[FiniteDimensional K V]`), for any subspace `U : Submodule K V`, we have `Uᗮ = ⊥ ↔ U = ⊤`. Here, `Uᗮ` denotes the orthogonal complement of `U`, `⊥` is the zero subspace `{0}`, and `⊤` is the whole space `V`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
The natural language says: ""Suppose U is a subspace of V. Prove that U^{\perp} = {0} iff U = V."" The Lean statement precisely formalizes this in the standard setting where the orthogonal complement is defined (an inner product space over ℝ or ℂ), and it uses `⊥` for `{0}` and `⊤` for `V`. The equivalence `Uᗮ = ⊥ ↔ U = ⊤` matches `U^⊥ = {0} iff U = V`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code adds the assumption that `V` is finite-dimensional. This is a reasonable and often necessary hypothesis for the equivalence without further assumptions (in infinite dimensions, one typically needs `U` closed to deduce `U = V` from `U^⊥ = {0}`). This is a slight specialization to ensure the statement holds outright. 
- The code also specifies the field is ℝ or ℂ, which is standard for inner product spaces.
Overall, this is a faithful and legitimate formalization with standard, appropriate hypotheses. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

  Natural language: U is nonempty (e.g., (0,0) ∈ U).

- theorem U_add_closed : ∀ x y : ℝ × ℝ, x ∈ U → y ∈ U → x + y ∈ U := by sorry
  Natural language: U is closed under addition: if x, y ∈ U then x + y ∈ U.

- theorem U_neg_closed : ∀ x : ℝ × ℝ, x ∈ U → -x ∈ U := by sorry
  Natural language: U is closed under additive inverses: if x ∈ U then −x ∈ U.

- theorem U_not_closed_smul : ∃ (c : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ), x ∈ U ∧ c • x ∉ U := by sorry
  Natural language: U is not closed under scalar multiplication: there exist a real scalar c and a vector x ∈ U such that c • x ∉ U (e.g., c = 1/2, x = (1,0)). Therefore U is not a subspace of ℝ².

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original asks for an example of a nonempty subset U of ℝ² that is closed under addition and additive inverses but is not a subspace. The code defines exactly such a U (the integer points on the x-axis), and explicitly states the three required properties: nonempty, closed under addition, closed under additive inverses, and also gives a statement showing failure of closure under scalar multiplication (hence not a subspace). This matches the intended example and properties.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not use any vacuous or fake definitions; U is a concrete subset. The theorems are stated (proofs omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for our purpose). 
- The statement “not a subspace” is captured via “not closed under scalar multiplication,” which is a correct way to demonstrate it is not a subspace. 
- No extraneous generalizations or specializations are introduced. Everything aligns with the natural language task.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib; no mathematical content added.
- Comment states the exercise and goal, matching the natural language statement.
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_3_5 : ¬ ∃ (x y : ℤ), 7 * x ^ 3 + 2 = y ^ 3 := by sorry`:
  This declares a theorem whose statement is: “It is not the case that there exist integers x and y such that 7*x^3 + 2 = y^3.” In other words, the Diophantine equation 7 x^3 + 2 = y^3 has no integer solutions. The `sorry` is a placeholder for the proof and does not affect the statement itself.

Faithfulness check:
- The natural language asks to show that the equation 7 x^3 + 2 = y^3 has no solution in integers. The Lean statement explicitly quantifies over integers `ℤ` for both variables and negates existence, exactly matching the claim.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement. No subtle changes (e.g., restricting to naturals, nonzero conditions, etc.).
- Thus, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language problem.

Final comparison:
- They are the same mathematical statement. No discrepancies found.

- `theorem infinitely_many_primes_congruent_neg_one_mod_six : ∀ N : ℕ, ∃ p : ℕ, p > N ∧ Prime p ∧ p % 6 = 5 := by sorry`:
  This states: For every natural number N, there exists a natural number p such that p > N, p is prime, and the remainder of p upon division by 6 is 5. Equivalently, p ≡ 5 (mod 6), i.e., p ≡ -1 (mod 6).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Show that there are infinitely many primes congruent to −1 modulo 6.”
- The code asserts: For every bound N, there is a prime p > N with p % 6 = 5. This is the standard formalization of “infinitely many” (arbitrarily large such primes), and `p % 6 = 5` is exactly “p ≡ −1 (mod 6)” since 5 ≡ −1 (mod 6).

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Using `%` on ℕ to express congruence is acceptable and equivalent here.
- The quantification over all N correctly captures “infinitely many.”
- No extra or missing conditions.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {K : Type*} [Field K] {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] [FiniteDimensional K V]`: We work over a field K, with a finite-dimensional K-vector space V.
- `theorem Axler_exercise_5_20 (T S : V →ₗ[K] V)`: T and S are K-linear endomorphisms of V.
- `(b : Fin (finrank K V) → V) (hb : IsBasis K b)`: b is an indexed basis of V.
- `(eigT eigS : Fin (finrank K V) → K)`: two families of scalars, intended to be eigenvalues for T and S on the basis b.
- `(hT : ∀ i, T (b i) = eigT i • b i)`: each basis vector b i is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue eigT i.
- `(hS : ∀ i, S (b i) = eigS i • b i)`: each basis vector b i is an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue eigS i.
- Conclusion: `S.comp T = T.comp S`: ST = TS.

2) Does this formalization match the natural statement?
- The natural statement: T has dim V distinct eigenvalues, and S has the same eigenvectors as T; prove ST = TS.
- From “T has dim V distinct eigenvalues,” it follows that there is a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T (an eigenbasis). “S has the same eigenvectors as T” then means that every vector in that eigenbasis is also an eigenvector of S (possibly with different eigenvalues). This precisely matches the Lean hypotheses: a basis b with T(b i) = λ_i b i and S(b i) = μ_i b i. With this, both T and S are diagonal in the same basis, hence commute.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean theorem assumes directly the existence of a common eigenbasis (simultaneous diagonalization) and proves ST = TS. The original hypothesis “T has dim V distinct eigenvalues” implies the existence of an eigenbasis for T, so combined with “S has the same eigenvectors,” the Lean hypotheses are satisfied. Thus the Lean statement is a slight generalization (it does not require distinct eigenvalues, only a common eigenbasis), but it is fully faithful to the original conclusion under the original assumptions.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions since we are judging the statement/translation, not the proof.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful (indeed slightly more general) formalization of the natural language statement’s content.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_7_6 (T : V →ₗ[ℂ] V) (h_normal : T.comp T.adjoint = T.adjoint.comp T) : LinearMap.range T = LinearMap.range T.adjoint := by sorry`
  This states: For a linear map T: V → V over ℂ, if T ∘ T* = T* ∘ T (i.e., T commutes with its adjoint; T is normal), then the range of T equals the range of T*.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: If T ∈ L(V) is normal, then range T = range T*. The Lean statement matches this precisely, formalizing normality as the commutation relation with the adjoint and concluding equality of ranges.
- The context in Lean assumes a complex finite-dimensional inner product space, which is a standard setting for this result (and ensures the adjoint and ranges behave as expected). The original statement did not specify the field or dimension, but in typical linear algebra contexts (e.g., Axler) V is finite-dimensional; restricting to ℂ and finite-dimensional is a benign specialization.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all concepts (adjoint, range, composition) are standard Mathlib definitions.
- The hypothesis `h_normal : T.comp T.adjoint = T.adjoint.comp T` is exactly the normality condition T T* = T* T.
- The conclusion `LinearMap.range T = LinearMap.range T.adjoint` matches `range T = range T*`.
- Minor specialization: ℂ and finite-dimensional. This is acceptable and faithful to the intended statement in a common setting.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This states: Let V be a complex inner product space. Let T be a linear operator on V over ℂ. Assume T is normal (`IsNormal T`) and satisfies T^9 = T^8 (where ^ denotes composition power). Then T is self-adjoint (`IsSelfAdjoint T`) and T^2 = T (idempotent). No auxiliary definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Suppose V is a complex inner-product space and T ∈ L(V) is a normal operator such that T^9 = T^8. Prove that T is self-adjoint and T^2 = T.”
- Lean: Exactly the same hypotheses and conclusions: complex inner product space, a linear operator T, normality assumption, the polynomial identity T^9 = T^8, and the conclusion that T is self-adjoint and idempotent.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only potential nuance is that some sources use L(V) to denote bounded/continuous linear operators in infinite-dimensional settings (i.e., V →L[ℂ] V). The code uses plain linear maps V →ₗ[ℂ] V. However, the predicates `IsNormal` and `IsSelfAdjoint` are explicitly assumed for T, and the prompt states the code compiles, so these notions apply in this context. In typical linear algebra (e.g., Axler) V is finite-dimensional, making all linear maps continuous, so this matches the intended meaning. There are no vacuous placeholders or auxiliary definitions. The statement is a direct, faithful formalization.

Conclusion: The code is a legitimate and faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem two_dvd_one_add_I_sq : 2 ∣ (1 + I) ^ 2 := by sorry`
  This states: ""2 divides (1 + i)^2."" Here `I` is the complex imaginary unit, so the ambient ring is `ℂ` (the complex numbers), not the Gaussian integers `ℤ[i]`. The divisibility symbol `∣` is the standard divisibility relation: `a ∣ b` means there exists `c` with `b = a * c`.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The statement says: ""Show that 2 is divisible by (1+i)^2 in ℤ[i]."" This means: ""(1+i)^2 divides 2"" in the ring of Gaussian integers. Formally: `(1 + i)^2 ∣ 2` in `ℤ[i]`.

3) Discrepancies:
- Direction reversed: The Lean code asserts `2 ∣ (1 + I)^2` (2 divides (1 + i)^2), whereas the natural language asserts `(1 + i)^2 ∣ 2` ((1 + i)^2 divides 2). These are not equivalent in general.
- Wrong ring: The Lean code is in `ℂ` (since it uses `I` without specifying Gaussian integers), but the statement is about `ℤ[i]` (Gaussian integers). In `ℂ`, any nonzero element divides any element, so the divisibility claim is trivial and does not capture the intended arithmetic content in `ℤ[i]`.
- Thus, the formal statement is both the converse implication and in the wrong domain.

Final check: The two math problems are different. The Lean code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

- We fix a type V with structure of a real inner product space and assume it is finite-dimensional: [NormedAddCommGroup V], [InnerProductSpace ℝ V], [FiniteDimensional ℝ V].
- We consider a linear map T : V →ₗ[ℝ] V and assume it is self-adjoint in the sense that for all x, y in V, ⟪T x, y⟫ = ⟪x, T y⟫.
- We fix real numbers λ and ε with ε > 0.
- We assume there exists a vector v ∈ V with ∥v∥ = 1 and ∥T v − λ • v∥ < ε.
- The theorem states there exists a real number λ' and a nonzero vector w ∈ V such that T w = λ' • w (so w is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue λ') and |λ − λ'| < ε.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: T ∈ L(V) is self-adjoint, λ ∈ 𝔽, ε > 0. If there exists v with ∥v∥ = 1 and ∥T v − λ v∥ < ε, then T has an eigenvalue λ' with |λ − λ'| < ε.
- The Lean code captures: self-adjoint linear operator T on a real inner product space (finite-dimensional), existence of a unit vector v with small residual, conclusion that there exists an eigenvalue λ' within ε of λ.
- This matches the meaning: self-adjoint is encoded by the inner product symmetry; the approximate eigenvector hypothesis is verbatim; the conclusion about existence of an eigenvalue and the quantitative bound is exact (for ℝ).

3) Comparison and any differences:
- Field: The statement uses a general field 𝔽 (likely ℝ or ℂ in context of inner product spaces). The Lean code specializes to ℝ. This is a slight specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- Dimensionality: The code assumes finite-dimensional V. In Axler’s context, V is finite-dimensional, so this aligns with the intended setting. Even if the natural language didn’t explicitly state it, this is standard in the source context and acceptable.
- Formalization of self-adjoint: The Lean code uses the property ⟪T x, y⟫ = ⟪x, T y⟫, which is the correct real self-adjoint condition.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the proof is omitted as allowed.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (slight specialization to ℝ and finite dimension) of the given natural language statement.

- Using `DifferentiableOn ℂ` is the standard Mathlib formalization of “holomorphic on Ω”. The absolute value condition is appropriately encoded as a constant real r. There are no extraneous or missing hypotheses.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: For odd prime p, a is a primitive root mod p iff for all prime divisors q of p−1, a^{(p−1)/q} ≠ 1 (mod p). The Lean theorem states exactly this equivalence, with a appropriately interpreted as an element of ZMod p. The definition `is_primitive_root_mod` captures “order p−1” in the multiplicative group modulo p (since ZMod p is a field for prime p and a^(p−1)=1 ensures a ≠ 0), so it faithfully formalizes “primitive root mod p.” The right-hand side quantifies over prime q dividing p−1 and asserts the standard generator test a^{(p−1)/q} ≠ 1.

- Domain: Lean takes a ∈ ZMod p; the statement speaks of integers modulo p—these are equivalent.
- Oddness: Lean includes `hp_odd : p ≠ 2`, matching “p odd.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines just bring in Mathlib and relevant namespaces.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem sum_moebius_mul_log_eq_self_at {n : ℕ} (hn : n ≠ 0) :` asserts a statement about a natural number n with n ≠ 0.
  The equality
  `(∑ d in n.divisors, μ (n / d) * Real.log d) = if n.isPrimePow then Real.log n.minFac else 0`
  says: the sum over all divisors d of n of μ(n/d) times log d equals a piecewise expression: if n is a prime power, then it is log of the minimal prime factor of n; otherwise it is 0. Here μ is the Möbius function (as an arithmetic function taking integer values), and `n.divisors` is the finite set of positive divisors of n. The product `μ (n / d) * Real.log d` is interpreted in ℝ via the natural coercion from ℤ to ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines Λ(n) = log p if n = p^k (with p prime, k ≥ 1), and Λ(n) = 0 otherwise. The desired identity is ∑_{d | n} μ(n/d) log d = Λ(n).
- In the Lean RHS, `if n.isPrimePow then Real.log n.minFac else 0` precisely encodes Λ(n): when n is a prime power, the minimal prime factor `n.minFac` is exactly that prime p, so Real.log n.minFac = log p; otherwise it is 0. For n = 1, `isPrimePow` is false and both sides evaluate to 0 as expected. The assumption `n ≠ 0` is a standard technical restriction since 0 has infinitely many divisors; the natural language statement typically considers positive integers, so this is consistent.
- The LHS is exactly the sum over divisors d of n of μ(n/d) log d, matching the given formula. The choice of variable name d (vs. A in the text) is immaterial.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The Lean statement and the natural statement are the same assertion: the Dirichlet convolution μ ⋆ log evaluated at n equals Λ(n). The representation of Λ via `if n.isPrimePow then Real.log n.minFac else 0` is faithful, since `n.minFac = p` when n is a prime power p^k, and returns 0 otherwise.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all symbols come from Mathlib. No auxiliary definitions are introduced.
- Minor technicality: the Lean version explicitly excludes n = 0, which is harmless and aligns with usual number-theoretic conventions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_3_14 (p q n : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (hq : q.Prime) (hpq : p ≠ q) (h : p - 1 ∣ q - 1) (h2 : (n : ZMod (p * q)) ≠ 0) : n ^ (q - 1) ≡ 1 [ZMOD p * q] := by sorry`
  This states: for natural numbers p, q, n, assume p and q are prime (`hp`, `hq`), they are distinct (`hpq : p ≠ q`), and that p − 1 divides q − 1 (`h : p - 1 ∣ q - 1`). Also assume `(n : ZMod (p * q)) ≠ 0` (i.e., n is not congruent to 0 modulo p*q, equivalently p*q ∤ n). Then conclude `n ^ (q - 1) ≡ 1 [ZMOD p * q]` i.e. n^(q-1) ≡ 1 mod p*q.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: p and q are distinct odd primes; in Lean: only `p.Prime`, `q.Prime`, `p ≠ q`. The “odd” condition is missing. This is a slight generalization; in fact the result remains true if p=2 (with q odd and p≠q), so this omission may be acceptable as a benign generalization.
- Natural language requires gcd(n, pq) = 1 (i.e., (n, pq)=1). In Lean, the hypothesis is `(n : ZMod (p * q)) ≠ 0`, which only says p*q does not divide n. This is strictly weaker than gcd(n, pq)=1. For example, n=p satisfies `(n : ZMod (p*q)) ≠ 0` but has gcd(n, pq)=p ≠ 1. The conclusion fails for such n (since n ≡ 0 mod p, then n^{q-1} ≡ 0 mod p, not 1), so the Lean statement is not faithful and is in fact false under its given assumptions.
- The divisibility condition `p - 1 ∣ q - 1` matches.
- The conclusion `n ^ (q - 1) ≡ 1 [ZMOD p * q]` matches “n^{q-1} ≡ 1 (pq)”.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Key difference: the coprimality condition. The original requires gcd(n, pq)=1; the Lean code only requires n not congruent to 0 mod pq (i.e., pq ∤ n). This is a serious mismatch and makes the Lean statement strictly weaker than needed, and actually incorrect in general (counterexample n=p). The missing “odd” requirement is a mild generalization that does not break the statement, but the coprimality mismatch is decisive. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, giving access to number theory notions like primes and divisibility.
- The theorem `Ireland_Rosen_exercise_5_13` is stated with variables `p : ℕ` (a natural number) and `x : ℤ` (an integer). The hypotheses are `hp : p.Prime` (p is a prime in the natural numbers) and `h : (p : ℤ) ∣ (x ^ 4 - x ^ 2 + 1)` (the integer p divides the integer `x^4 - x^2 + 1`; `p` is coerced to ℤ for divisibility). The conclusion is `p % 12 = 1`, meaning p is congruent to 1 modulo 12.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that any prime divisor of x^4 - x^2 + 1 is congruent to 1 modulo 12."" The Lean statement reads: For any natural prime p and integer x, if p divides `x^4 - x^2 + 1` in ℤ, then `p % 12 = 1`. This is precisely the same logical content: ""any prime divisor ... is ≡ 1 mod 12."" Writing the conclusion as `p % 12 = 1` is an acceptable and standard way in Lean to express `p ≡ 1 [MOD 12]` and is equivalent in this context.
- The quantification over all x and primes p matches the intended generality. The coercion `(p : ℤ)` ensures divisibility is in the integers, which is the usual setting for ""prime divisors"" of an integer expression.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is direct and faithful.

3) Final check/comparison:
- Both problems assert: if p is a (positive) prime dividing `x^4 - x^2 + 1`, then p ≡ 1 mod 12. There are no extra assumptions or weakenings. The conclusion is expressed as `p % 12 = 1`, which is equivalent to congruence modulo 12 for naturals.
- No discrepancies found.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_1_13a {Ω : Set ℂ} (hΩ : IsOpen Ω) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : IsHolomorphicOn f Ω) (c : ℝ) (h : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).re = c) : ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = (c : ℂ) := by sorry`
  This states: Let Ω be a subset of ℂ, assumed open. Let f : ℂ → ℂ be holomorphic on Ω. Suppose there exists a real constant c such that for all z in Ω, Re(f z) = c. Then for all z in Ω, f z equals the complex number c (i.e., f is identically the real constant c on Ω).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: If f is holomorphic on an open set Ω and Re(f) is constant, then f is constant (on Ω). Typically, this means there exists some complex constant C such that f(z) = C for all z in Ω (or on each connected component if Ω is not assumed connected). It does not force the imaginary part to be zero; for example, f ≡ i has Re(f) ≡ 0 and is indeed constant.
- Lean theorem conclusion is strictly stronger and generally false: it concludes f(z) = (c : ℂ) for all z ∈ Ω, i.e., the imaginary part is 0 everywhere. From Re(f) ≡ c, the correct conclusion is f is constant with some (possibly nonzero imaginary) constant; the code fixes the constant to be exactly c (purely real), which is not implied by the hypotheses.
- Additionally, the natural statement often implicitly requires connectedness (domain) to conclude a single constant on all of Ω; the Lean statement assumes only openness, yet concludes a single global constant anyway. This is a further mismatch, though the main issue is the wrong constant.

3) Final check: The two problems are different. The Lean code demands that the constant value of f equals the given real c (i.e., imaginary part 0), while the natural statement only asserts existence of some complex constant. The Lean statement also omits any connectedness condition but still concludes a single constant. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We work over Polynomial ℂ.
- The theorem Axler_exercise_4_4 is stated for a polynomial p : Polynomial ℂ and a natural number m, with hypothesis hdeg : p.natDegree = m.
- The left-hand side of the equivalence is: there exists xs : Fin m → ℂ such that xs is injective and p = C p.leadingCoeff * ∏ i, (X - C (xs i)). In words: p factors over ℂ as its leading coefficient times a product of m distinct linear factors (X - xi) with the xi pairwise distinct.
- The right-hand side is: for all z, if p.eval z = 0 then p.derivative.eval z ≠ 0. In words: no complex number z is simultaneously a root of p and p′, i.e., p and p′ have no common roots.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Suppose p ∈ P(ℂ) has degree m. Prove that p has m distinct roots iff p and its derivative p′ have no roots in common.
- Over ℂ, “p has m distinct roots” is equivalent to p splitting into m distinct linear factors. The Lean LHS encodes exactly that by writing p as leadingCoeff times a product of m distinct linear factors.
- “p and p′ have no roots in common” is encoded by ∀ z, p(z)=0 → p′(z) ≠ 0, which matches the intended meaning.
- Thus, for nonzero polynomials p with degree m, the statement is a faithful formalization.

3) Discrepancies and domain issues:
- The natural language hypothesis “p has degree m” (in standard mathematics) excludes the zero polynomial, since deg(0) is not a natural number (often −∞). In Lean, the hypothesis used is p.natDegree = m. In Mathlib, natDegree 0 = 0, so the code admits the case p = 0 with m = 0.
- In the zero polynomial case: the LHS holds (since p = C 0 * ∏ (empty) = 0 with m = 0), but the natural-language interpretation “has 0 distinct roots” is false (the zero polynomial has infinitely many roots). The RHS also fails (since p and p′ are both zero, they have all roots in common), so the equivalence as stated in Lean would actually be false in that extra case.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a slight but meaningful generalization of the domain that includes an extraneous case (p = 0, m = 0) not allowed by the usual definition of degree, and in that case the characterization is not the intended one. The fix would be to require p ≠ 0 (or degree p ≠ ⊥) instead of natDegree = m, or to add p ≠ 0 as a hypothesis.

Conclusion: Apart from the zero-polynomial edge case induced by natDegree, the formalization matches the natural-language statement precisely. Because of that domain mismatch, it is not fully faithful, but it is very close.

  sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open ZMod`: We are working in Mathlib and opening the ZMod namespace (integers modulo p).
- The comment states the exercise: For a prime p with p ≡ 3 mod 4, show a is a primitive root modulo p iff −a has order (p−1)/2.
- The theorem `Ireland_Rosen_exercise_4_5 {p : Nat} (hp : p.Prime) (hmod4 : p % 4 = 3) {a : (ZMod p)ˣ}` sets up:
  - p is a natural number prime (`hp : p.Prime`).
  - p is of the form 4t+3, encoded as `p % 4 = 3` (`hmod4`).
  - a is a unit in ZMod p, i.e., an invertible residue class mod p (`a : (ZMod p)ˣ`).
- The statement `(OrderOf a = p - 1) ↔ (OrderOf (-a : (ZMod p)ˣ) = (p - 1) / 2)` says: a has multiplicative order p−1 in the unit group iff −a has multiplicative order (p−1)/2 in the unit group.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per instructions we only audit the statement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- In number theory, “a is a primitive root modulo p” means that the residue class of a in (Z/pZ)^× has order p−1. In Lean, this is exactly `OrderOf a = p - 1` when `a : (ZMod p)ˣ`. So the left-hand side matches the primitive root condition.
- The right-hand side precisely asserts that −a (viewed as a unit in ZMod p) has order (p−1)/2.
- The hypothesis “p of the form 4t+3” is encoded as `p % 4 = 3`, which is standard and equivalent for primes.
- Restricting `a` to `(ZMod p)ˣ` is exactly the faithful formalization of “a modulo p” with gcd(a,p)=1; primitive root is only defined for units anyway.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib concepts are used.
- Minor technicalities like integer vs natural division are handled: `(p-1)/2` is a natural number division, but under `p % 4 = 3` we have that p is odd and p−1 is divisible by 2, so this matches the intended meaning.

Final comparison:
- The formal statement is equivalent to the natural language statement in all mathematical content. There are no discrepancies: the code expresses exactly the equivalence between “a is a primitive root mod p” and “−a has order (p−1)/2” under p ≡ 3 mod 4.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem primitives_differ_by_constant (f : ℂ → ℂ) (F G : ℂ → ℂ) (Ω : Set ℂ)` introduces a complex-valued function f on ℂ, two candidate primitives F and G on ℂ, and a subset Ω ⊆ ℂ.
- `(hcont : ContinuousOn f Ω)` assumes f is continuous on Ω.
- `(hΩ : IsOpen Ω)` assumes Ω is open.
- `(hconn : IsConnected Ω)` assumes Ω is connected (in Mathlib, this also implies nonempty), matching the notion of a ""region"" (open and connected set) in complex analysis.
- `(hF : ∀ z ∈ Ω, HasDerivAt F (f z) z)` assumes that for every z ∈ Ω, F is complex differentiable at z with derivative f z; i.e., F is a primitive of f on Ω.
- `(hG : ∀ z ∈ Ω, HasDerivAt G (f z) z)` similarly assumes G is a primitive of f on Ω.
- Conclusion: `∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, F z = G z + c`, i.e., there exists a complex constant c such that on Ω, F and G differ by c.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If f is continuous on a region Ω, then any two primitives (if they exist) differ by a constant. The code assumes Ω is open and connected (region), f is continuous on Ω, and F, G are primitives of f on Ω, and concludes they differ by a constant on Ω. This matches exactly.
- Technical choices: F and G are defined on all of ℂ rather than Ω, but the derivative condition is only required at points z ∈ Ω; this is a standard and harmless generalization. The explicit continuity assumption on f is included; although redundant given the existence of primitives, it matches the phrase ""f is continuous"" in the natural statement.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Domain specialization: The statement is in the complex plane; the code uses ℂ explicitly. This is consistent with typical usage.
- Region: The code uses IsOpen and IsConnected (implying nonempty), which is standard for ""region."" The natural statement typically also means nonempty; no issue.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; all are standard Mathlib predicates.
- Conclusion form F z = G z + c is equivalent to saying they differ by a constant.

Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to show ∫_{−∞}^{∞} cos x / (x^2 + a^2) dx = π e^{−a} / a for a > 0.
- The Lean statement uses the Lebesgue integral over ℝ, written `∫ x : ℝ, ...`, which represents integration over the whole real line. For this function and a > 0, the integrand is integrable (bounded numerator, denominator ~ x^2, and no singularity since a > 0), so the Lebesgue integral equals the classical improper integral from −∞ to ∞. The right-hand side matches exactly `π * exp(−a) / a`.
- The condition `ha : 0 < a` matches “for a > 0.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def leg_sym (a : Int) (p : Int) : Int := 0`: Introduces a placeholder function `leg_sym` intended to represent the quadratic (Legendre/Jacobi) symbol (a/p), but it is defined to be identically 0 for all inputs. This is a vacuous placeholder and not a faithful definition of the symbol.
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_5_37 {a p q : Int} (ha : a < 0) (hp_not_dvd : ¬ (p ∣ a)) (hcong : (4 * a) ∣ (p - q)) : leg_sym a p = leg_sym a q := by sorry`: For integers a, p, q, assuming a is negative (a < 0), p does not divide a, and p ≡ q mod 4a (encoded as (4*a) ∣ (p - q)), conclude that `leg_sym a p = leg_sym a q`. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses: The code captures ""a is negative"" as `a < 0`, ""p ≡ q (4a)"" as `(4 * a) ∣ (p - q)`, and ""p ∤ a"" as `¬ (p ∣ a)`. These align well with the natural language conditions.
- Conclusion: The natural language uses the quadratic symbol (a/p) and (a/q). The code attempts to represent this via `leg_sym`, but `leg_sym` is defined to be constantly 0, which makes the conclusion trivial and not about the actual Legendre/Jacobi symbol. Thus the core mathematical content is not faithfully represented.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Major discrepancy: `leg_sym` is a vacuous placeholder (always 0), so the theorem statement is trivially true regardless of the hypotheses, whereas the intended statement concerns equality of genuine quadratic symbols. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- Minor considerations: The code does not impose standard domain conditions for the Jacobi/Legendre symbol (e.g., p and q odd positive, gcd conditions). The natural language statement as provided also omits these, so this mismatch is less critical for the audit. The use of divisibility to express congruence is standard and faithful.

Conclusion: Due to the vacuous placeholder for the quadratic symbol, the translation is not faithful.

- The theorem statement: `theorem powerSeries_summable_on_circle (z : ℂ) (hz : ‖z‖ = 1) : Summable fun n => z^n / n ^ 2` reads as: For any complex number z with |z| = 1, the series with general term z^n / n^2 (indexed over n : ℕ) is summable (i.e., convergent).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that the power series ∑ z^n / n^2 converges at every point of the unit circle."" The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: for any z on the unit circle (‖z‖ = 1), the series ∑ z^n / n^2 is summable.
- The domain is ℂ, and the unit circle condition is given by ‖z‖ = 1, matching ""every point of the unit circle"".

3) Final check and possible discrepancies:
- Indexing: The Lean series is over n : ℕ starting at 0, so the n = 0 term would be z^0 / 0^2. In Mathlib, 1/0 is defined as 0, so the 0th term is 0. Typically, the natural-language series is intended from n = 1 to ∞. This minor indexing difference does not affect convergence and is standard in formalizations. Hence it is not a substantive discrepancy.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural-language statement, with only a harmless indexing convention difference.

    n ≥ 1729 := by sorry
",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The theorem states a conjunction of two parts.
- Part 1: There exist natural numbers a, b, c, d such that a^3 + b^3 = 1729 and c^3 + d^3 = 1729, with a ≠ b and c ≠ d (so each sum uses two distinct cubes), and the ordered pair (a, b) is neither equal to (c, d) nor to (d, c). This ensures the two representations are genuinely different up to order.
- Part 2: For every natural number n, if there exist natural numbers a, b, c, d with a^3 + b^3 = n and c^3 + d^3 = n, with a ≠ b and c ≠ d, and (a, b) distinct from (c, d) and (d, c), then n ≥ 1729. This asserts minimality of 1729 among n in ℕ that admit two such distinct representations.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language: ""Show that 1729 is the smallest positive integer expressible as the sum of two different integral cubes in two ways.""
- The Lean code captures: existence of two distinct representations of 1729 as a sum of two distinct cubes (with explicit unordered-pair distinction), and minimality among all natural numbers n with that property.
- The code works entirely over ℕ (nonnegative integers) for a, b, c, d and for n.
- The phrase ""integral cubes"" in the natural language typically means integer cubes (ℤ), possibly including negative integers. If negatives are allowed, the smallest positive integer with two representations as a sum of two cubes is 91 = 3^3 + 4^3 = 6^3 + (−5)^3, not 1729. Thus, if ""integral"" is interpreted as all integers (including negatives), the mathematical content differs.
- If the intended meaning is ""positive integral cubes"" (i.e., cubes of natural numbers), then the Lean statement matches well: it enforces a ≠ b, c ≠ d and accounts for unordered pair distinctness, and correctly states the minimality over ℕ.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
- Differences:
  - Domain: Lean uses ℕ for the bases and for n. The natural language says ""integral cubes"" which suggests ℤ. This is a substantive discrepancy because allowing negative integers changes the minimal example from 1729 to 91.
  - Positivity of n: The Lean statement quantifies over ℕ (so n ≥ 0); combined with the property, this effectively asserts minimality among positive integers with the property, which is fine.
  - Distinctness conditions: The Lean code explicitly enforces that within each representation the two cubes are different (a ≠ b, c ≠ d) and that the two representations are not the same up to order; this aligns with ""two different integral cubes"" and ""in two ways"".
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; it is a single theorem statement (proof omitted) that compiles.

Conclusion: The only substantive mismatch is ℕ vs ℤ (“integral” possibly including negative integers). Given that this can change the truth of the statement, the formalization is not fully faithful, though it is otherwise a very good specialization to positive cubes. Hence: not faithful overall; grade close to perfect but not 10.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the Mathlib library; no mathematical content change.
- Docstring: States the informal goal: for each positive integer n, the number `10^(10^(10^n)) + 10^(10^n) + 10^n - 1` is not prime.
- `theorem not_prime_task (n : ℕ) : ¬ (10^(10^(10^n)) + 10^(10^n) + 10^n - 1).Prime := by sorry`:
  This declares a theorem with variable `n : ℕ` (n is a natural number, i.e., 0,1,2,...) and asserts that the natural number `10^(10^(10^n)) + 10^(10^n) + 10^n - 1` is not prime (`Nat.Prime` negated). There is no proof (sorry), but we only audit the statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The mathematical expression exactly matches the given number: `10^(10^(10^n)) + 10^(10^n) + 10^n - 1`, with exponentiation and additions/subtraction in ℕ. The use of `.Prime` denotes primality in natural numbers, which is appropriate.
- The quantification is slightly stronger in Lean: `(n : ℕ)` ranges over all natural numbers including 0, whereas the natural language asks for positive integers. Apart from this broader domain, the property stated is identical.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code directly states the theorem.

3) Final comparison:
- Difference: The Lean version claims the result for all `n ∈ ℕ`, including `n = 0`, while the natural statement restricts to positive integers `n ≥ 1`.
- This is a slight generalization; it does not distort the intended meaning and is acceptable per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation up to a minor generalization (allowing `n = 0`).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` loads the math library, providing real analysis tools including integrals, trigonometric functions, and logarithms.
- `open scoped Real Topology` and `open Real Set Filter intervalIntegral MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace` bring into scope notations and definitions for real numbers, topological notions, sets, filters, interval integrals, and measure spaces.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem integral_log_sin_pi_eq_neg_log_two : ∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, log (sin (π * x)) = -log 2 := by sorry`
  asserts that the interval integral of the function `x ↦ log(sin(π * x))` over the interval from 0 to 1 equals `- log 2`. The notation `∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, ...` is the Lebesgue interval integral over [0,1] (endpoints are negligible in Lebesgue measure, which aligns with the classical improper integral interpretation here). The integrand `log (sin (π * x))` matches `log( sin(π x))`. The right-hand side is `- log 2`.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is exactly: Show that ∫_0^1 log(sin π x) dx = - log 2.
- The Lean statement is precisely the same mathematical assertion, using standard Mathlib notation for the interval integral and functions involved.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing guidelines.
- Minor technical note: the integrand has singularities at the endpoints 0 and 1, but the interval integral in Mathlib is Lebesgue-based and ignores values on sets of measure zero, so this matches the intended improper integral. This is a benign formalization detail and does not alter the meaning.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same: the integral of log(sin πx) from 0 to 1 equals −log 2.
- No discrepancies found.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- import Mathlib; open Complex Finset: sets up the environment and namespaces.
- def f_n (n : ℕ) (z : ℂ) : ℂ := ∑ k in Finset.range n, (↑(n - k) : ℂ) * z ^ k
  This defines f_n(z) as the finite sum over k = 0, 1, ..., n-1 of (n - k) z^k. Explicitly:
  k=0 gives n·z^0 = n, k=1 gives (n-1)z, ..., k=n-1 gives 1·z^{n-1}. This matches n + (n-1)z + (n-2)z^2 + ... + z^{n-1}.
- theorem Putnam_2018_B2 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) : ∀ z : ℂ, |z| ≤ 1 → f_n n z ≠ 0 := by sorry
  This states: for any positive integer n (hn: 0 < n), for all complex z with |z| ≤ 1, f_n(z) ≠ 0. No proof is provided (sorry), but the statement is clear.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural statement: Let n be a positive integer, define f_n(z) = n + (n-1) z + ... + z^{n-1}. Prove that f_n has no roots in the closed unit disk {z ∈ ℂ : |z| ≤ 1}.
The Lean code defines exactly that polynomial and asserts that for all z with |z| ≤ 1, f_n n z ≠ 0. This is identical in meaning. The use of ℂ absolute value is the complex norm. The positive integer condition is present (hn : 0 < n).

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Definition of f_n matches term-by-term via a finite sum over 0..n-1 with coefficients (n-k).
- Domain condition |z| ≤ 1 is correctly captured.
- n is required to be positive.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced.
Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: The set of integers n for which there exist integers a,b with n = a^2 + b^2, integers c,d with n+1 = c^2 + d^2, and integers e,f with n+2 = e^2 + f^2 is infinite. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; it does not affect the statement.
  Parentheses/associativity: The conjunctions are right-associative, so the condition reads as all three properties hold simultaneously. This matches the intended meaning. The quantifiers for a,b,c,d,e,f are independent, as expected.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that there exist infinitely many integers n such that n, n+1, n+2 are each the sum of the squares of two integers.""
- Lean: Asserts the set of such integers n is infinite, with explicit existential witnesses for squares for n, n+1, n+2. This is a direct formalization.
- Uses Int throughout, matching ""integers"" in the statement. No extra or missing conditions.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. Only a theorem statement with an omitted proof.
- No mismatch: ""sum of two integer squares"" is exactly captured as ""∃ a b : Int, ... = a^2 + b^2"" for each of n, n+1, n+2.
- Using Int (not Nat) aligns with the natural language. The infinitude notion `Set.Infinite` is standard and faithful to ""infinitely many"".

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language claim.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines just bring in libraries and namespaces; they do not affect the mathematical content.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem b5_putnam_exercise_2020 : ∀ z : Fin 4 → ℂ, (∀ j, ‖z j‖ = 1 ∧ z j ≠ 1) → 3 - z 1 - z 2 - z 3 - z 4 + z 1 * z 2 * z 3 * z 4 ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  reads as: For every function `z` from `Fin 4` to the complex numbers (i.e., a 4-tuple of complex numbers), if for all `j : Fin 4` we have `‖z j‖ = 1` and `z j ≠ 1`, then the complex number `3 - z 1 - z 2 - z 3 - z 4 + z 1 * z 2 * z 3 * z 4` is nonzero.

Notes on indexing:
- `Fin 4` is the type of 4 elements, typically represented by 0,1,2,3. In Lean, writing `z 1, z 2, z 3, z 4` uses the coercion from naturals to `Fin 4`, with `4 : Fin 4` being definitionally `0` (since it is taken modulo 4). Thus the tuple used in the expression is `(z 1, z 2, z 3, z 0)`, which is just a permutation of all four entries `z 0, z 1, z 2, z 3`.
- The hypothesis `(∀ j, ‖z j‖ = 1 ∧ z j ≠ 1)` is over all `j : Fin 4`, i.e. it includes the element corresponding to `z 0`, which is the same entry as `z 4` in the conclusion. Therefore, all four numbers used in the conclusion satisfy the stated conditions.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: for j in {1,2,3,4}, let z_j be complex with |z_j|=1 and z_j ≠ 1; prove that `3 − z_1 − z_2 − z_3 − z_4 + z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 ≠ 0`.
- The Lean code universally quantifies over a 4-tuple `z : Fin 4 → ℂ` with the condition `‖z j‖ = 1` and `z j ≠ 1` for each of the four entries. The conclusion asserts exactly the same inequality, with the slight indexing quirk that `z 4` denotes the fourth element via `z 0`. Since the expression is symmetric and includes each of the four entries exactly once in the sum and the product, this is merely a renaming/permutation of indices and does not change the statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement matches the intended mathematical content.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same. The only technical detail is the use of `Fin 4` indexing and the fact that `4 : Fin 4` equals `0`, but this simply permutes labels and does not alter the mathematics. The hypotheses and the desired inequality match precisely.

  This asserts that the function from natural numbers n ↦ sqrt(n+1) − sqrt(n) (interpreted in ℝ) tends to 0 in ℝ as n tends to infinity (atTop) in ℕ. Here `Tendsto ... atTop (nhds 0)` is exactly the formalization of convergence to 0, and the coercions `(n : ℝ)` ensure real square roots.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: Prove that √(n+1) − √n → 0 as n → ∞. The Lean statement precisely encodes this: a sequence indexed by ℕ converging in ℝ to 0. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement appears. Using ℕ for the index set matches the usual meaning of n → ∞ in this context.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_3_22 : ¬ ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), ...` asserts that there does not exist a complex-valued function on the complex plane satisfying the subsequent properties.
- `continuous_on f (closed_ball (0 : ℂ) 1)` means f is continuous on the closed unit disk D̄ = {z : |z| ≤ 1}.
- `analytic_on f (ball (0 : ℂ) 1)` means f is holomorphic (complex analytic) on the open unit disk D = {z : |z| < 1}.
- `∀ z ∈ sphere (0 : ℂ) 1, f z = z⁻¹` means on the unit circle ∂D = {z : |z| = 1}, f agrees with the function z ↦ 1/z.
- Altogether: there is no f : ℂ → ℂ that is holomorphic on the open unit disk, continuous on the closed unit disk, and equals 1/z on the unit circle.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement: “Show that there is no holomorphic function f in the unit disc D that extends continuously to ∂D such that f(z) = 1/z for z ∈ ∂D.”
- The Lean statement requires f to be holomorphic on D (analytic_on on the open ball), continuous on D̄ (continuous_on on the closed ball), and equal to 1/z on ∂D (sphere). This is exactly the typical formalization of “holomorphic in D and extends continuously to the boundary with those boundary values.”
- The only minor difference is that the Lean f is a function ℂ → ℂ, whereas the natural language only requires f to be defined on D (with a continuous extension to ∂D). This is a harmless strengthening: if such an f existed on D with continuous extension to ∂D, one could define a global function on ℂ agreeing with it on D̄ and arbitrary outside, still satisfying the Lean hypotheses. Thus nonexistence in the Lean formulation implies nonexistence in the original statement. Hence the translation is faithful.

3) Final check: are the problems the same?
- Domains/sets used: `ball 0 1` = open unit disc D, `closed_ball 0 1` = closed unit disc D̄, `sphere 0 1` = unit circle ∂D. These perfectly match the intended sets.
- Properties: “holomorphic on D” ↔ `analytic_on f (ball 0 1)`; “extends continuously to ∂D” is captured by continuity on D̄ (since holomorphic already implies continuity on D, and continuity at boundary points in D̄ is exactly the extension property); boundary values equal to 1/z are stated precisely.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions. All terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- The slight strengthening (f defined on ℂ) does not alter the essence of the statement and is acceptable.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any type G equipped with a group structure (`[Group G]`) and which is finite (`[Fintype G]`), there exists a natural number m with m > 0 such that for every element a in G, a^m equals the identity element 1 in G. The proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original says: If G is a finite group, there is an integer m > 0 with a^m = e for all a in G.
- The Lean statement assumes G is a group and finite, and concludes existence of m > 0 (with m a natural number) such that a^m = 1 for all a.
- Using Nat for a positive integer is equivalent to an integer m > 0. The identity element e is denoted `1 : G` in multiplicative notation. So the meanings align exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Integer vs natural number: No substantive difference since m > 0; Nat is appropriate.
- Identity e vs 1: Standard notation difference; they are the same in multiplicative groups.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., commutativity) and no missing conditions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just the theorem statement.

  This formal statement says: Given a real function f with `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` (i.e., f is three times continuously differentiable on ℝ), there exists a real number a such that the sum f(a) + f'(a) + f''(a) + f'''(a) equals 0. Here, `deriv f a` denotes f'(a), `deriv (deriv f) a` denotes f''(a), and `deriv (deriv (deriv f)) a` denotes f'''(a). No auxiliary definitions are used; the statement relies on standard Mathlib notions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The provided natural language is truncated: “Let f be a real function on the real line with continuous third derivative. Prove that there exists a point a such that …”. The well-known Putnam 1998 A3 completion is “f(a) + f'(a) + f''(a) + f'''(a) = 0,” which is exactly what the Lean theorem asserts. The assumption “continuous third derivative” is formalized as `ContDiff ℝ 3 f`, the standard Mathlib notion for f being C^3, which matches the intended meaning. The quantifiers and domain (ℝ) align.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; `ContDiff` and `deriv` are standard.

3) Final comparison:
- Aside from the truncation in the provided natural language statement, the Lean code precisely states the classical Putnam A3 claim. No discrepancies in meaning, quantifiers, or domains. The use of `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` correctly captures “has continuous third derivative,” and the equality matches the known statement. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This defines what it means for p to be a condensation point of E in ℝ: for every radius r > 0, the intersection of E with the open interval (p − r, p + r) is not countable (i.e., is uncountable). Since in ℝ, open balls around p are exactly such intervals, this matches the notion that every neighborhood of p contains uncountably many points of E.

- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_126 (E : Set ℝ) (h : ¬ E.Countable) : ∃ p : ℝ, IsCondensationPoint p E := by sorry`
  This states: If E ⊆ ℝ is uncountable (expressed as ¬ E.Countable), then there exists a point p ∈ ℝ such that p is a condensation point of E (as just defined).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: If E is an uncountable subset of ℝ, then there exists p ∈ ℝ at which E condenses. The formalization defines ""E condenses at p"" precisely as every neighborhood (here, every open interval around p) containing uncountably many points of E, and the theorem asserts such a p exists given E is uncountable. This matches the statement exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Using open intervals Ioo (p − r, p + r) is equivalent to using open balls/neighborhoods in ℝ, and the property is monotone (if all balls have uncountably many points, so do all neighborhoods), so there is no mismatch.
- ""Uncountable"" is rendered as ¬ Countable, which is standard and correct in mathlib.
- The statement demands p ∈ ℝ (not necessarily in E), which matches the formal theorem’s domain for p.
No discrepancies or vacuous placeholders are present; the auxiliary definition is legitimate and standard.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in mathlib.
- The theorem statement `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_41 {m : ℕ} : IsCompact (closedBall (0 : Fin m → ℝ) 1) := by sorry` reads: For any natural number m, the closed unit ball centered at 0 with radius 1 in the normed space (Fin m → ℝ) is compact. Here, `(Fin m → ℝ)` is a standard Lean model of ℝ^m (m-tuples of real numbers). `closedBall (0 : Fin m → ℝ) 1` denotes the set {x : ∥x∥ ≤ 1} for the norm on this type given by the default normed structure in Mathlib (the sup norm on the finite product).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let ∥·∥ be any norm on ℝ^m and let B = {x ∈ ℝ^m : ∥x∥ ≤ 1}. Prove that B is compact.” This quantifies over any norm on ℝ^m and asserts that the closed unit ball for that norm is compact.
- The Lean statement proves compactness of the closed unit ball for the specific, canonical norm instance on `(Fin m → ℝ)` (the default sup norm). It does not quantify over all possible norms on ℝ^m; it asserts the result for the particular built-in norm.
- The identification ℝ^m ≅ (Fin m → ℝ) is faithful. The set `closedBall (0) 1` matches {x : ∥x∥ ≤ 1} for the given norm instance. “IsCompact” matches “compact.”

3) Are the two problems the same?
- Difference: The original states the result for any norm on ℝ^m, while the Lean theorem states it only for the default norm on `(Fin m → ℝ)`. So the Lean statement is a specialization, not the fully general statement. While in mathematics all norms on finite-dimensional spaces are equivalent (so the statement is true for any norm), the Lean theorem as written does not express this generality—there is no universal quantification over norms.
- Everything else aligns (space, set, property), and the specialization chosen is a standard concrete model of ℝ^m.

Conclusion: Near pass. It is a correct special case and a reasonable formalization path, but it does not encode the “any norm” quantification from the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The context fixes a subset Ω ⊆ ℂ with hypotheses: IsOpen Ω (Ω is open) and Bounded Ω (Ω is bounded).
- A function φ : ℂ → ℂ is given, together with hφ : HolomorphicOn φ Ω (φ is holomorphic on Ω).
- A point z0 ∈ Ω is given (hz0), satisfying φ z0 = z0 (hfix) and deriv φ z0 = 1 (hderiv), i.e., the complex derivative of φ at z0 equals 1.
- The conclusion asserts: ∃ a b : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, φ z = a * z + b. In words, φ restricts to an affine linear map on Ω.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural statement: Let Ω be a bounded open subset of ℂ, and φ : Ω → Ω holomorphic. If there exists z0 ∈ Ω with φ(z0) = z0 and φ'(z0) = 1, then φ is linear.
- The Lean theorem matches the properties of Ω (bounded, open) and the fixed point/derivative condition at z0.
- The Lean code interprets “φ is linear” as “φ is affine linear on Ω,” i.e., there exist a, b with φ(z) = a z + b for all z ∈ Ω. This is a standard interpretation in complex analysis where “linear” often means affine-linear in this context. The statement is explicit and matches the intended meaning.
- One difference: the natural statement types φ : Ω → Ω (so φ maps Ω into itself), while the Lean code has φ : ℂ → ℂ with only HolomorphicOn φ Ω, and does not assume or conclude φ(Ω) ⊆ Ω. This weakens the hypotheses (a slight generalization), but it does not change the main conclusion about linearity on Ω. The rest (holomorphicity on Ω, fixed point, derivative 1) is faithfully captured.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct theorem with standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, Bounded, HolomorphicOn, deriv).
- The only discrepancy is the absence of the mapping-into-Ω hypothesis (MapsTo φ Ω Ω), and the explicit choice to state “affine linear” rather than just “linear.” Both are acceptable as a slight generalization and a standard clarification, respectively.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is essentially a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, up to a mild generalization in the codomain condition.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`: Using Mathlib and the Filter framework for convergence.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_12a {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α] {p : ℕ → α} {f : ℕ → ℕ} (hf : Injective f) {L : α} (h : Tendsto p atTop (nhds L)) : Tendsto (p ∘ f) atTop (nhds L) := by sorry`
  - α is an arbitrary topological space.
  - p : ℕ → α is a sequence in α.
  - f : ℕ → ℕ is a function between natural numbers.
  - hf : Injective f asserts that f is injective.
  - L : α is a limit candidate.

  - Conclusion: Tendsto (p ∘ f) atTop (nhds L), i.e., the sequence q_k = p_{f(k)} also converges to L.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines a rearrangement q_k = p_{f(k)} and asks to show that if f is injective, the limit is unaffected by rearrangement. The Lean statement exactly asserts: if p_n → L and f is injective, then (p ∘ f) → L.
- The use of `Tendsto` with `atTop` and `nhds L` is the standard formalization of sequence convergence.
- The composition `(p ∘ f)` correctly models q_k = p_{f(k)}.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- The Lean theorem generalizes the setting from sequences in (implicitly) ℝ or a metric space to sequences in an arbitrary topological space α. This is a standard, harmless generalization and still faithful to the original claim.
- The natural statement allows any function f: ℕ → ℕ under the label “rearrangement,” and then imposes injectivity for the result. The Lean statement assumes exactly this (f is injective). No mismatch.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (indeed slightly more general), with no vacuous definitions. The presence of `sorry` only omits the proof but does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open_locale BigOperators`: Set up Mathlib and notation for infinite sums/products. This is standard and appropriate for working with power series.
- `theorem putnam_exercise_2017_b3 (c : ℕ → ℤ) ...`: We fix a sequence of coefficients `c_i` indexed by natural numbers, taking integer values.
- Hypothesis `hc : ∀ i, c i = 0 ∨ c i = 1`: Every coefficient is either 0 or 1. This matches the problem statement that each `c_i` is 0 or 1.
- Hypothesis `hf : (∑' i : ℕ, (c i : ℝ) * ((2 : ℝ) / 3) ^ i) = (3 : ℝ) / 2`: This states that the real infinite series sum of `c_i (2/3)^i` equals `3/2`, i.e., `f(2/3) = 3/2`.
- Conclusion: `¬ ∃ (p q : ℤ), q ≠ 0 ∧ (∑' i : ℕ, (c i : ℝ) * ((1 : ℝ) / 2) ^ i) = (p : ℝ) / (q : ℝ)`: There do not exist integers `p, q` with `q ≠ 0` such that the real value of the series at `x=1/2` equals `p/q`. This is precisely the statement that `f(1/2)` is irrational.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The code encodes the power series `f(x) = ∑ c_i x^i` via `tsum (c i : ℝ) * x^i` evaluated at `x = 2/3` and `x = 1/2`.
- Coefficients are specified as integers taking values 0 or 1; this is a faithful and even slightly stronger typing than allowing real 0 or 1, but mathematically equivalent for this problem.
- The hypothesis `hf` is exactly `f(2/3) = 3/2`.
- The conclusion expresses “`f(1/2)` is irrational” as “not equal to any rational `p/q` with integers `p, q` and `q ≠ 0`,” which is standard.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Technical detail: Using `tsum` on ℝ is appropriate; convergence at `x = 2/3` and `x = 1/2` is guaranteed in this context (coefficients bounded, |x| < 1), and the assumption `hf` explicitly fixes the value at `2/3`.

Final check: The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same mathematically. There are no discrepancies in quantification, domain, or conclusion. Thus, the translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show there is a bijection from the collection of open subsets of a metric space M (𝒯) onto the collection of closed subsets (𝒦). The Lean statement provides exactly an `Equiv` between `{ U : Set M // IsOpen U }` and `{ A : Set M // IsClosed A }`, which is precisely a bijection between the collections of open and closed subsets of M. The comment specifies the intended bijection is complement, which matches the standard argument.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope: Both are about a metric space M; Lean requires `[MetricSpace M]`, matching the natural language.
- Objects: Lean uses subtypes to represent the collections of open/closed subsets; this is standard and faithful.
- Claim: An `Equiv` is exactly a bijection. The code claims a specific equivalence (not just existence), which is stronger but consistent with ""show there is a bijection"".
- No auxiliary vacuous placeholders are introduced; the only `sorry` is for the construction/proof, which is acceptable per the instructions since we assess the statement, not the proof.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: If a > 1 is an integer, show that n ∣ φ(a^n − 1). The conventional exercise includes n a positive integer; the docstring explicitly includes that, and the theorem assumes 1 ≤ n. This matches the intended meaning.
- Using ℕ for a and n is equivalent to using integers with the given inequalities (a > 1 implies a is a positive integer ≥ 2; n is assumed positive). So the domain restriction is a harmless specialization consistent with the statement.
- The expression a^n − 1 in ℕ is safe under the given assumptions (a ≥ 2, n ≥ 1 ⇒ a^n ≥ 2 ⇒ a^n − 1 ≥ 1), so there’s no truncation issue.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof.

- `def disk (c : ℝ × ℝ) (r : ℝ) : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := { x | (x.1 - c.1) ^ 2 + (x.2 - c.2) ^ 2 < r ^ 2 }`:
  Defines the open disk in ℝ² centered at `c` with radius `r` using the usual Euclidean norm squared inequality. This is a standard, faithful definition of an open disk.
- `def S : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := disk (0, 0) 1 ∪ disk (2, 0) 1 ∪ {(1, 0)}`:
  Defines S as the union of two open unit disks centered at (0,0) and (2,0), together with the single point (1,0). These two open disks are disjoint (distance between centers equals sum of radii, and strict inequality makes them disjoint), and the added point lies on both boundaries.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_57 : IsConnected S ∧ ¬IsConnected (interior S) := by sorry`:
  States that S is connected, and the interior of S is not connected. No proof is provided (marked by `sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that if S is connected, it is not true in general that its interior is connected."" This means the implication ""S connected implies interior S connected"" is not universally valid; a counterexample suffices.
- The code provides precisely such a counterexample in ℝ²: it asserts that S is connected while its interior is disconnected. The interior of S equals the union of the two open disks (adding the point does not enlarge the interior), and since those disks are disjoint nonempty open sets, the interior is disconnected. The set S itself is connected because the added point (1,0) lies in the closure of each disk, and the union can be seen as the union of two connected sets (each disk plus the joining point) intersecting at that point.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem asserts the existence of a connected S with disconnected interior, which directly demonstrates that the general statement ""connected S implies connected interior"" is false. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `disk` and `S` are genuine definitions, and standard Mathlib notions (`IsConnected`, `interior`) are used correctly.
- Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim via a concrete counterexample.

  This declares: For any type `G` with a group structure and finite, if the cardinality of `G` is 6 and `G` is not abelian (i.e., it's not the case that `a * b = b * a` for all `a b`), then there exists a group isomorphism between `G` and `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`.
  Here `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)` is the symmetric group on a 3-element set, i.e., S3; `≃*` denotes a multiplicative group isomorphism.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Natural language: “If G is a nonabelian group of order 6, prove that G ≃ S3.”
- Lean: Assumes G is a finite group with |G|=6 and nonabelian, concludes `G ≃* Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`.
This is precisely the same: finite group of order 6, nonabelian, isomorphic to S3. The representation of S3 as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)` is standard in Mathlib. The nonabelian condition is encoded as the negation of universal commutativity, which is correct. The conclusion is a group isomorphism, matching “≃”.

- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No change in generality or assumptions beyond those in the statement.
- The use of `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)` for S3 is faithful.
- Thus the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

The use of [Fintype G] and the hypothesis card G = p^2 precisely captures “a group of order p^2.” The conclusion ∃ H : Subgroup G, H.normal ∧ Fintype.card H = p exactly matches “has a normal subgroup of order p.”

The current statement claims the existence of a `CommGroup G` structure but does not ensure it coincides with the existing group structure; it’s stronger in the sense of packaging an entire new structure and not merely stating commutativity of the given multiplication. Thus, even as a statement, it is not the standard faithful formalization of “the group is abelian.”
- Moreover, the code does not compile: `Herstein_exercise_2_1_21.lean` is not a valid Lean term or identifier (contains dots, no definition), so the theorem is ill-formed as provided. The auditing instructions assume compiling code; this violates that.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - Non-compiling RHS: invalid proof term.
  - Target type `CommGroup G` is a structure, not a propositional statement of commutativity for the given group; it does not assert that the existing `[Group G]` is abelian, but rather produces some commutative group structure on G, potentially different from the existing operations.
- Therefore, the Lean code is not a legitimate, faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful, and it does not compile.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Real`: bring in mathlib and open Real namespace.
- The theorem `Pugh_exercise_3_63b (p : ℝ) (hp : p ≤ 1) : ¬ Summable (fun n => if n ≥ 2 then 1 / ((n:ℝ) * Real.rpow (Real.log (n:ℝ)) p) else 0)` states: for a real parameter p with p ≤ 1, the series over natural numbers n of the terms defined by `if n ≥ 2 then 1 / (n * (log n)^p) else 0` is not summable (i.e., it diverges). Here `Real.rpow (Real.log (n:ℝ)) p` is (log n)^p for real exponent p, and the `if n ≥ 2 ... else 0` makes the series effectively start at n = 2. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is “Prove that ∑ 1/(k (log k)^p) diverges when p ≤ 1,” typically with k starting at 2. The code states precisely that for real p with p ≤ 1, the series from n = 0..∞ of the sequence that is zero for n < 2 and equals 1/(n (log n)^p) for n ≥ 2 is not summable. This is exactly the divergence of ∑_{n=2}^∞ 1/(n (log n)^p).
- Using `Real.rpow` captures real exponents p, which matches the usual statement where p is a real number. The guard `n ≥ 2` ensures log n > 0, so the base of the power is positive; for n < 2 the term is defined to be 0, so no issue with log 0 or log 1.
- “Diverges” is formalized as “¬ Summable ...”, which is the standard formalization.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- Indexing: The natural language typically starts at k = 2; the Lean code enforces this via `if n ≥ 2 then ... else 0`, which is equivalent. No discrepancy.
- Exponent and logarithm: The code uses natural logarithm `Real.log` and real power `Real.rpow`, matching the usual mathematical meaning of (log k)^p for real p.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem with an omitted proof, which is fine for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

The proof is omitted (""sorry""), which is acceptable for translation audit.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement is: For a group G and a, x in G, prove that C(x^{-1} a x) = x^{-1} C(a) x. In standard group-theoretic notation, x^{-1} C(a) x denotes the conjugate set { x^{-1} g x | g ∈ C(a) }. The Lean right-hand side (fun g => x⁻¹ * g * x) '' C a is exactly this set image under conjugation, so it matches the intended meaning. The left-hand side is the centralizer of x^{-1} a x, defined exactly as in group theory. Thus the formal statement precisely matches the mathematical statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The definition of the centralizer C is standard and faithful.
- The set equality C (x⁻¹ * a * x) = (fun g => x⁻¹ * g * x) '' C a is exactly the same as C(x^{-1} a x) = x^{-1} C(a) x.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; the only auxiliary definition (centralizer) is legitimate.
Therefore, the Lean code faithfully translates the given statement.

  Natural language: For any type R equipped with a ring structure (`[Ring R]`), if for every x in R we have x^3 = x, then R is a commutative ring (`CommRing R`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypothesis `∀ x : R, x ^ 3 = x` exactly matches “in which x^3 = x for every x ∈ R”.
- The conclusion `CommRing R` captures “R is commutative” in the standard algebraic sense (commutative multiplication, with the rest of ring structure). In Lean, this is the canonical way to express that the given ring is commutative.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The Lean statement assumes `[Ring R]`, i.e., a ring with 1. The natural language statement does not explicitly specify whether the ring has 1. In many contexts “ring” includes 1; even if one uses the “rng” convention (no 1), this is just a slight specialization, acceptable per the guidelines.
- The conclusion strengthens to giving a full `CommRing` structure rather than only asserting commutativity of multiplication, but this is exactly the formalization of “R is commutative” for a ring in Lean.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem signature with an omitted proof.

Conclusion: The Lean declaration faithfully translates the natural language statement, up to the standard Lean formalization conventions.

  This declares a theorem: For any `I` which is an ideal of the ring `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ` (i.e., 2×2 real matrices), either `I = ⊥` (the zero ideal) or `I = ⊤` (the whole ring). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted but does not affect the statement's faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let R be the ring of 2×2 matrices over ℝ; suppose I is an ideal of R. Show I = (0) or I = R.
- The Lean statement universally quantifies over ideals `I` of `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ` and asserts `I = ⊥ ∨ I = ⊤`. This is exactly the same claim. In Mathlib, `Ideal` for noncommutative rings denotes two-sided ideals, which matches the standard interpretation of “ideal” in this context.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The ring is precisely the 2×2 real matrices via `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ`. The conclusion matches exactly: only the zero ideal or the whole ring. No generalization or specialization beyond the original statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- The theorem statement:
  - For types `G` and `H` with group structures `[Group G]`, `[Group H]` and both finite `[Fintype G]`, `[Fintype H]`.
  - Hypotheses `hG : Fintype.card G = 21` and `hH : Fintype.card H = 21`: both groups have exactly 21 elements.
  - Hypotheses `hGnon : ¬ CommGroup G` and `hHnon : ¬ CommGroup H`: intended to assert that `G` and `H` are nonabelian.
  - Conclusion: `Nonempty (G ≃* H)`: there exists a group isomorphism between `G` and `H`.
- `by sorry`: proof omitted (placeholder).

Step 2: Assess if this matches the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that any two nonabelian groups of order 21 are isomorphic.""
- The Lean theorem intends to formalize exactly that: given two groups of order 21 that are nonabelian, there exists an isomorphism between them.
- However, the way ""nonabelian"" is encoded is incorrect: `¬ CommGroup G` is not the right predicate in Mathlib. `CommGroup G` is a typeclass structure (a Type), not a Prop about the given group operation, so negating it is not the correct or well-typed way to say ""the given group law on G is not commutative."" The correct Prop would be something like `¬ IsCommutative G (· * ·)` or equivalently `¬ (∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a)`, or using a provided alias such as `¬ (IsCommutative G (fun a b => a * b))`. In Mathlib, one also sometimes uses `¬ (∀ a b, a * b = b * a)` or a dedicated Prop if available (e.g., `IsAbelian G` if defined in the context), but certainly not `¬ CommGroup G`.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Intended meaning: Yes, both aim to say that any two nonabelian groups of order 21 are isomorphic.
- Formalization discrepancy: The hypothesis `¬ CommGroup G`/`¬ CommGroup H` is the wrong formal predicate and (in actual Lean) is ill-typed as a Prop; it does not faithfully express ""nonabelian with respect to the given group structure."" This is a substantive formal mismatch.
- No other auxiliary definitions are present; the rest of the statement (finite groups, order 21, existence of group isomorphism) matches the original claim.

Conclusion: The only issue is the incorrect formalization of ""nonabelian"" via `¬ CommGroup G`. If that were replaced with the correct Prop about the group operation not commuting, the statement would be a faithful translation. Given this issue, it is not fully faithful, but it is very close.

- The theorem:
  `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_5_25 (p : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) : Irreducible (∑ i in Finset.range p, X ^ i : Polynomial ℚ) := by sorry`
  This states: For a natural number p with p prime, the polynomial over ℚ given by the finite sum ∑_{i ∈ Finset.range p} X^i is irreducible. Here `Finset.range p` is {0, 1, ..., p-1}, so the sum is exactly 1 + X + X^2 + ... + X^{p-1}. The ambient ring is `Polynomial ℚ`, i.e., ℚ[x].

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If p is prime, q(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{p-1} is irreducible in ℚ[x].
- The Lean statement: If p is prime, the polynomial ∑_{i=0}^{p-1} X^i in Polynomial ℚ is irreducible.
These match exactly: same hypothesis (p prime), same polynomial (geometric sum 1 + X + ... + X^{p-1}), same ring (ℚ[x]), same conclusion (irreducible).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; no placeholders defining concepts. The only `sorry` is for the proof, which is allowed for translation auditing.
- Notational correspondence: `X` is the polynomial variable; `Finset.range p` produces indices 0..p-1; the type annotation `: Polynomial ℚ` ensures the ring is ℚ[x]. Everything matches the natural language statement.

The natural language statement: ""If P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G and P ◁ G, prove that P is the only p-Sylow subgroup of G."" The Lean theorem exactly formalizes this: it assumes P is a Sylow p-subgroup and normal, and concludes any p-Sylow subgroup Q equals P. The ambient assumptions (G finite, p prime) are standard and appropriate for Sylow theory.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code uses Mathlib's `IsSylow p P` for ""P is a p-Sylow subgroup"" and `P.normal` for normality; both are standard.
- The conclusion `∀ Q, IsSylow p Q → Q = P` is precisely ""P is the unique p-Sylow subgroup"".
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement with an unfinished proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

  This states: The set of real quaternions q such that q*q equals -1 (the quaternion -1) is infinite. No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct assertion about the infinitude of the solution set.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to show there are infinitely many solutions to x^2 = -1 in the quaternions. The Lean statement expresses exactly that: the set {q : quaternion ℝ | q*q = -1} is infinite. Using `Set.Infinite` is the standard formalization of “there are infinitely many solutions.” Using multiplication `q*q` is appropriate for noncommutative quaternions and matches x^2.
- The use of `quaternion ℝ` denotes the quaternions over the reals, matching the usual meaning of “the quaternions.” The coercion `(-1 : quaternion ℝ)` is the correct way to express −1 in that ring. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions, and no auxiliary constructs.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same: both assert the set of quaternions satisfying q^2 = −1 is infinite. No change in scope, generality, or meaning.
- Minor note: in Mathlib the type is typically `Quaternion ℝ` (capital Q) or `ℍ`; however, the prompt asserts the code compiles, so we accept `quaternion ℝ` as available in this context. This does not affect the semantic faithfulness of the formalization.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Suppose |G| = p m with p ∤ m and p prime. If H is a normal subgroup of order p in G, prove H is characteristic.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is about `cos 1°`, i.e., cosine of 1 degree, which equals `cos (π/180)` in radians. The Lean code asserts `IsAlgebraic ℚ (cos 1)`, which is cosine of 1 radian. These are different numbers. The correct formal target should be something like `IsAlgebraic ℚ (Real.cos (Real.pi/180))` (or an equivalent expression for 1 degree in radians).

- Natural language: Prove `cos(1°)` is algebraic over `ℚ`.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_6_15 {G : Type _} [CommGroup G] {m n : Nat}` means: Let G be an abelian group and m, n be natural numbers.
- Hypothesis `hm : ∃ x : G, x ^ m = 1 ∧ ∀ k, k < m → x ^ k ≠ 1` means: There exists an element x in G with x^m = 1 and for all k with k < m, x^k ≠ 1. This is intended to express that x has order m, but as written it forbids even k = 0, where x^0 = 1, causing a contradiction when m > 0.
- Hypothesis `hn : ∃ y : G, y ^ n = 1 ∧ ∀ k, k < n → y ^ k ≠ 1` similarly intends that y has order n, but suffers from the same issue (excludes k = 0).
- Hypothesis `hc : Nat.Coprime m n` means m and n are coprime (gcd(m, n) = 1).
- Conclusion `∃ z : G, z ^ (m * n) = 1 ∧ ∀ k, k < m * n → z ^ k ≠ 1` intends to assert there is an element z of order exactly mn, but again misses the requirement that k > 0 in the minimality clause, making it inconsistent when mn > 0.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If G is abelian and has an element of order m and one of order n, with m and n relatively prime, then G has an element of order mn.
- The code tries to formalize “order m” as: x^m = 1 and for all k < m, x^k ≠ 1. However, this is incorrect: you must exclude k = 0 (or equivalently require 0 < k < m). As written, for any m > 0, k = 0 satisfies k < m, but x^0 = 1, so the condition x^k ≠ 1 fails, making the hypothesis impossible for positive m. Conversely, if m = 0, the condition becomes vacuous for the minimality part, and x^0 = 1 holds for all x, so the hypothesis becomes trivially true; but “order 0” is not the intended notion of order. The same flaw appears for n and for the conclusion involving mn.
- Thus, the code does not faithfully capture “element of order m” or “element of order mn”. It crucially omits the positivity constraint on k in the minimality condition. This is not a minor technicality: it changes the meaning substantially and makes the hypotheses either contradictory (for m > 0) or vacuous (for m = 0).
- Additionally, the natural language context implicitly assumes m, n ≥ 1; the code does not enforce this, allowing pathological cases with m = 0 or n = 0 under `Nat.Coprime` (e.g., gcd(0,1) = 1), which do not correspond to elements of order 0.

Final check:
- The intended theorem is standard: in a commutative group, if x has order m and y has order n with gcd(m, n) = 1, then xy has order mn. The code aims in that direction but fails to correctly formalize “order m” and “order mn” due to the missing 0 < k restriction. Thus, the two statements are not the same.

Verdict: Not faithful. To fix, replace `∀ k, k < m → x ^ k ≠ 1` with `∀ k, 0 < k ∧ k < m → x ^ k ≠ 1` (or an equivalent formulation), or use Mathlib’s `orderOf x = m` and `orderOf (x*y) = m*n` under commutativity and coprimality.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib's library.
- theorem Herstein_exercise_2_9_2 {G1 G2 : Type*} [Group G1] [Group G2] [Fintype G1] [Fintype G2] (m n : Nat) ... : This states a theorem for two finite groups G1 and G2 (not necessarily abelian, but groups), with finite cardinalities.
- (hG1_card : Fintype.card G1 = m), (hG2_card : Fintype.card G2 = n): Assumptions that |G1| = m and |G2| = n.
- (hcyc1 : ∃ g1 : G1, orderOf g1 = m), (hcyc2 : ∃ g2 : G2, orderOf g2 = n): Assumptions that G1 has an element of order m and G2 has an element of order n, i.e., each is cyclic of that order (since in a finite group, existence of an element of order equal to the group order implies the group is cyclic).
- Conclusion: (∃ g : G1 × G2, orderOf g = m * n) ↔ Nat.coprime m n: The direct product G1 × G2 has an element of order m·n if and only if m and n are coprime.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language: If G1 and G2 are cyclic groups of orders m and n, respectively, then G1 × G2 is cyclic if and only if m and n are relatively prime.

The Lean statement assumes G1 and G2 are finite of cardinalities m and n, and have elements of those orders, which is exactly being cyclic of those orders. Its conclusion is that there exists an element in G1 × G2 of order m·n if and only if m and n are coprime. In finite groups, G1 × G2 has cardinality m·n (a general Mathlib fact), so the existence of an element of order m·n is equivalent to G1 × G2 being cyclic. Thus the Lean conclusion is equivalent to the natural language claim.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- The formulation via “∃ g, orderOf g = m * n” is a standard equivalent way to state “G1 × G2 is cyclic” in the finite setting, using the given cardinality equalities and the general result that |G1 × G2| = |G1|·|G2| = m·n.
- No extra assumptions beyond the natural statement are imposed; using [Group] instead of [CommGroup] is fine because a cyclic group is in particular a group, and the product statement does not require commutativity as an assumption.
- Hence the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library, giving access to polynomial notions over ℚ.
- `open Polynomial` twice (redundant, but harmless) opens the Polynomial namespace for notation like `X` and operations on polynomials.
- The theorem statement `theorem cube_minus_three_minus_one_irreducible_over_Q : Irreducible (X ^ 3 - 3 * X - 1 : ℚ[X]) := by sorry` asserts that the polynomial `X^3 - 3*X - 1` over the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients `ℚ[X]` is irreducible. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the proposition being stated is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove that the polynomial x^3 − 3x − 1 is irreducible over ℚ. The Lean statement is exactly `Irreducible (X ^ 3 - 3 * X - 1 : ℚ[X])`, which is a direct formalization of the same claim.

3) Final check:
- Same polynomial: yes, `X^3 - 3*X - 1` corresponds to x^3 − 3x − 1.
- Same field: yes, `: ℚ[X]` denotes polynomials over the rationals.
- Same property: `Irreducible` is the standard Mathlib predicate for irreducibility in a ring (here, polynomial ring over ℚ).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions: none are introduced. The use of `sorry` is a missing proof, but the task is to check translation, not proof. The statement itself is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  - Let G be a type with a group structure `[Group G]` and finite cardinality `[Fintype G]`.
  - Assume `h : 2 ∣ Fintype.card G`, i.e., the order (cardinality) of G is even.
  - Conclusion: There exists an element `g : G` such that `g ≠ 1` and `g ^ 2 = 1`.

Assessment of meaning:
- The natural language statement says: ""A group of even order contains an element of order 2."" In group theory, an element has order 2 iff `g ≠ 1` and `g^2 = 1`. Thus the Lean conclusion precisely encodes the existence of an element of order 2.
- The hypothesis ""group of even order"" is faithfully represented by `[Fintype G]` (finiteness) and `2 ∣ Fintype.card G` (even cardinality).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a single theorem statement with an unprovided proof (which is acceptable for translation checking).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem card_field_ext (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] (n : ℕ) (q : Polynomial (ZMod p)) (hq : Irreducible q) (hn : q.natDegree = n) : ...` sets up: let p be a natural number with a proof that p is prime; let F = ZMod p; let q be a polynomial over F; assume q is irreducible and has degree n.
- The conclusion is a conjunction of three statements about the quotient ring `(ZMod p)[x] ⧸ Ideal.span {q}`:
  1) `IsField (ZMod p)[x] ⧸ Ideal.span {q}`: the quotient by the ideal generated by q is a field.
  2) `Fintype (ZMod p)[x] ⧸ Ideal.span {q}`: the quotient is a finite type (i.e., has finitely many elements).
  3) `Fintype.card (ZMod p)[x] ⧸ Ideal.span {q} = p ^ n`: the number of elements of the quotient is exactly p^n.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let F = Z_p, p prime, and q(x) irreducible of degree n. Show that F[x]/(q(x)) is a field having exactly p^n elements.
- The Lean statement exactly captures this: it asserts the quotient is a field and that its cardinality is p^n. The inclusion of `Fintype` as a separate conjunct is consistent with and implied by the cardinality statement and does not change the meaning.
- The use of `Ideal.span {q}` correctly represents the principal ideal (q) in F[x]. The assumptions `Irreducible q` and `q.natDegree = n` match “irreducible of degree n.” The base ring `ZMod p` with `[Fact p.Prime]` matches F = Z_p where p is prime.

Potential technical notes (do not affect faithfulness):
- In Lean, `Fintype α` is a typeclass, not a Prop, so conjoining it with `∧` is unconventional in a statement; similarly, `Fintype.card` requires an instance. These are typing/elaboration concerns, not issues of mathematical faithfulness. The mathematical content is correct and aligns with the natural language statement.

Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning: the quotient ring F[x]/(q) is a field with exactly p^n elements. No extraneous or missing assumptions are present. No vacuous definitions are used. Thus the translation is faithful.

- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_11_22 (hG : Fintype.card G = p ^ n) (hH : Fintype.card H = p ^ (n - 1)) : H.normal := by sorry`: Under the assumptions that |G| = p^n and |H| = p^(n-1), conclude H is a normal subgroup of G. The proof is omitted (`sorry`) but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
The natural statement: ""Show that any subgroup of order p^{n-1} in a group G of order p^n is normal in G."" The Lean statement exactly captures: for any prime p, natural n, finite group G with cardinality p^n, and any subgroup H with cardinality p^(n-1), H is normal. The use of `H : Subgroup G` and the hypotheses `Fintype.card G = p ^ n` and `Fintype.card H = p ^ (n - 1)` match the narrative. The conclusion `H.normal` is the standard Mathlib proposition that H is normal.

3) Final check and potential differences:
- The Lean code quantifies over a fixed but arbitrary subgroup H; this is equivalent to ""any subgroup"" in the natural statement.
- It assumes `p` is prime (`hp : Prime p`), aligning with the statement.
- Small technicality: Lean uses natural number subtraction `n - 1`, which for `n = 0` becomes `0`, so the statement also trivially covers the case |G| = 1, |H| = 1. This is a harmless slight generalization and consistent with the intended theorem (normally one assumes n ≥ 1 implicitly). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; there are no auxiliary definitions at all, and the theorem statement is exactly the mathematical content.
Thus the translation is faithful.

  translates to: For any type G equipped with a group structure, and any elements a, b in G, the subgroup generated by the set {a, b} equals the subgroup generated by the set {b * a * b^2, b * a * b^3}. Here `Subgroup.closure` is the standard Mathlib notion of the subgroup generated by a set, and `{a, b}` is the two-element set in G. The terms `b^2` and `b^3` are standard natural powers in a group.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that two elements a, b of a group generate the same subgroup as b a b^2, b a b^3."" The Lean statement asserts exactly that the subgroup generated by {a, b} equals the subgroup generated by {bab^2, bab^3}. This matches precisely.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Scope: General group G, arbitrary a, b — matches.
- Objects: Subgroups generated by {a, b} and by {b a b^2, b a b^3} — matches.

  - `(hg_ne : g ≠ 1)`: The element `g` is not the identity.
  - `(hg2 : g * g = 1)`: The square of `g` is the identity. Together with `g ≠ 1`, this means `g` has order 2.
  - `(huniq : ∀ h : G, h ≠ 1 → h * h = 1 → h = g)`: Any element `h` of `G` which is not the identity and satisfies `h^2 = 1` must equal `g`. This asserts uniqueness of the element of order 2.
- Conclusion: `∀ x : G, g * x = x * g`: The element `g` commutes with every element `x` of the group; i.e., `g` is central.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""If a group contains exactly one element of order 2, then that element is in the center of the group.""
- The Lean theorem assumes the existence of an element `g` with order 2 (captured by `g ≠ 1` and `g * g = 1`) and that it is unique among such elements (captured by `huniq`). The conclusion is that `g` commutes with every element, i.e., `g` is central.
- This exactly matches the content of the natural language statement: the hypotheses encode ""there exists exactly one element of order 2"" and the conclusion encodes ""that element is central"".

Checks for issues:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. There are no auxiliary definitions at all.
- The encoding of ""order 2"" as `g ≠ 1` and `g * g = 1` is standard and correct.
- The uniqueness hypothesis excludes the identity (as it should), matching the usual meaning of ""order 2"".
- The conclusion is a standard formulation of centrality.

  In natural language, this asserts that the polynomial X^3 + 6·X + 12, viewed as a polynomial with rational coefficients (Polynomial ℚ), is irreducible.

  Natural language: Let p be a natural number which is prime (hp) and not equal to 2 (hpodd), let a and b be integers, and suppose that the rational sum ∑_{k=1}^{p-1} 1/k equals the rational number a/b. Then p divides a as an integer. Here `Finset.Ico 1 p` denotes the set {1, 2, ..., p-1}, and the sum is taken in ℚ with terms (1 : ℚ)/(k : ℚ).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Let p be an odd prime and let 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p-1) = a/b with a, b integers. Show p | a.
- Lean: Assumes p is prime and p ≠ 2 (i.e., p is an odd prime), and assumes a, b ∈ ℤ with the same equality in ℚ. Concludes (p : Int) ∣ a. This matches the intended arithmetic divisibility statement over integers.
- The sum range `Finset.Ico 1 p` correctly represents 1 through p − 1. The equality is in ℚ with appropriate coercions, matching the rational sum in the problem.

3) Final check and differences:
- Quantification: The Lean theorem is universally quantified over all integers a, b satisfying the equality, whereas the natural language says “let ... = a/b” (which implicitly fixes some choice of a, b). The Lean version is a slight strengthening: it proves p | a for any such representation, not just one. This is fine and faithful (and standard), since if the statement holds in lowest terms, it holds for any representation (every other representation is a multiple and preserves p | a).
- No requirement that the fraction be in lowest terms appears in the Lean statement; the original text as given also does not explicitly demand this. Even if one intended “lowest terms,” the Lean statement is a valid and slightly more general formalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms come from Mathlib. The statement is precise and uses standard Mathlib constructs.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful (indeed slightly stronger) formalization of the natural language statement.

  This asserts: the set of integers a for which the polynomial over ℚ given by X^7 + 15 X^2 − 30 X + a is irreducible is infinite. Here `(a : ℚ)` coerces the integer a to a rational coefficient, and because the whole expression is typed as `Polynomial ℚ`, this becomes the constant polynomial with coefficient a in ℚ.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib; standard.
- Docstring: States the goal: prove associativity of addition on Z/nZ. The file-save comment is irrelevant to content.
- `theorem add_assoc_ZMod (n : ℕ) (a b c : ZMod n) : (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) := by sorry`: For any natural number n and any residue classes a, b, c in ZMod n, we have (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the task; we're auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly formalizes the associativity of addition in the ring ZMod n (i.e., ℤ/nℤ). It universally quantifies over n and elements a, b, c, and states the associativity identity. This matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean code allows n = 0 (since n : ℕ), where Mathlib defines ZMod 0 ≅ ℤ. Associativity of addition still holds, so this is at most a slight generalization, not a mismatch.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is precise and standard.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_2_2_9 {G : Type*} [Group G] (a b : G) (hab : a * b = b * a) : ... := by sorry`
  This states: For any group G and elements a, b in G with the assumption that a and b commute (`a * b = b * a`), we want to prove a property.
- The property: `∀ x y : G, x ∈ Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G) → y ∈ Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G) → x * y = y * x`.
  This means: For all elements x and y of G, if x and y lie in the subgroup generated by {a, b} (i.e., `Subgroup.closure ({a, b})`), then x and y commute (`x * y = y * x`).

`Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G)` is Mathlib’s standard notion of the subgroup generated by the set {a, b}, so this is exactly the subgroup H generated by a and b.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: Let H be the subgroup generated by two elements a, b of a group G. If ab = ba, then H is abelian. The Lean statement asserts that any two elements x, y in the subgroup generated by {a, b} commute. That is exactly the meaning of H being abelian (commutative) as a subgroup. Thus the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code phrases “H is abelian” as “∀ x y ∈ H, x * y = y * x,” which is the standard property of an abelian group.
- H is represented as `Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G)`, which is precisely the subgroup generated by a and b.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions; the use of `sorry` for the proof is acceptable for translation checking.
There are no discrepancies in mathematical meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open set notation.
- The theorem `herstein_exercise_5_2_20` is stated for a type `K` with instances `[Field K] [Infinite K]` (so K is an infinite field), a type `V` with `[AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]` (so V is a K-vector space), a finite set `s : Finset (Submodule K V)` (a finite family of K-subspaces of V), and a hypothesis `h : ∀ W ∈ s, (W : Set V) ≠ Set.univ` (each submodule W in s is proper, i.e., its underlying set is not all of V). The conclusion is `(⋃ W ∈ s, (W : Set V)) ≠ (Set.univ : Set V)`, i.e., the union of the underlying sets of the submodules in s is not the whole space V.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but that does not affect the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let V be a vector space over an infinite field F. Show that V cannot be the set-theoretic union of a finite number of proper subspaces of V.""
- Lean: For any finite set `s` of submodules (subspaces) of `V`, if each is proper (encoded as its set not being `univ`), then the set-theoretic union of those subspaces is not `univ`. This is exactly the formalization of “cannot be the union of finitely many proper subspaces.” The field is infinite (`[Infinite K]`), and V is a K-vector space — matching the hypothesis.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The Lean statement matches the natural language statement precisely: it quantifies over an arbitrary finite set of subspaces and asserts their union is not all of V, assuming each is proper, with V over an infinite field. Using `(W : Set V) ≠ Set.univ` is equivalent to `W ≠ ⊤` for submodules, so the notion of “proper subspace” is correctly captured. There are no extraneous or missing conditions.
- No discrepancies found.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization.

The `by sorry` is a placeholder for the proof and does not affect the statement itself.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that x^2 + 1 is irreducible in F_7.”
- In Lean, `ZMod 7` denotes the finite field with 7 elements (since 7 is prime), which corresponds to the usual `F_7`.
- `Irreducible (X ^ 2 + 1 : Polynomial (ZMod 7))` is precisely the formalization that the polynomial x^2 + 1 is irreducible over F_7.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct statement of the theorem.

3) Final check:
- The math problems are the same: irreducibility of x^2 + 1 over the field with 7 elements.

Here, `orderOf x` is Mathlib’s standard definition of the order of an element (a natural number, with 0 indicating infinite order, which is irrelevant here).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: Let x be an element of G. Prove x^2 = 1 iff |x| is either 1 or 2. The Lean statement matches exactly: it asserts the equivalence between `x ^ 2 = 1` and `orderOf x = 1 ∨ orderOf x = 2`. This is the standard formalization of the order of an element using `orderOf` in Mathlib. No additional assumptions (like commutativity) are added, and no parts are omitted.

- The natural language uses |x| for order; Lean uses `orderOf x`. Equivalent.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: Bring in the Mathlib library and open the polynomial namespace; standard setup.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_8 (p : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) : Irreducible (X ^ n - C (p : ℚ)) := by ...`
  This states: For a natural number p with p prime, and a natural number n with n > 0, the polynomial X^n − C(p : ℚ) (i.e., x^n − p viewed as a polynomial over ℚ) is irreducible in ℚ[x]. The comment notes this follows from Eisenstein's criterion at the prime p. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for our translation audit.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: ""Let p be a prime integer. Prove that the polynomial x^n − p is irreducible in ℚ[x].""
- Lean theorem: Assumes p : ℕ with p.Prime (i.e., p is a positive prime integer) and n : ℕ with 0 < n (i.e., n ≥ 1), and concludes irreducibility of x^n − p in ℚ[x]. The polynomial is expressed as `X ^ n - C (p : ℚ)`, which is exactly x^n − p over ℚ.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Domain/codomain: The polynomial is over ℚ[x] in both.
- Polynomial: x^n − p matches `X ^ n - C (p : ℚ)`.
- Assumptions: The Lean version explicitly requires n > 0, which is a reasonable and essentially implicit condition in the natural statement (since for n = 0 the polynomial would be constant). The Lean version takes p ∈ ℕ with p prime, which is a standard specialization of ""prime integer"" to positive primes; this does not change the mathematical content in ℚ[x].
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with omitted proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with a harmless explicit condition n > 0 and p taken as a positive prime natural number.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- We fix a type G with a Group structure.
- The theorem introduces Z := center G, where center G is the subgroup of elements commuting with all of G (a standard Mathlib definition returning a Subgroup G).
- The hypothesis is: there exists g : G such that for every x : G, there exists n : Int with QuotientGroup.mk Z x = QuotientGroup.mk Z (g ^ n). This says that every coset xZ in the quotient G/Z equals (gZ)^n for some integer n, i.e., G/Z is cyclic generated by the image of g.
- The conclusion is the conjunction: (1) ∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a (i.e., G is abelian), and (2) Z = ⊤ (i.e., the center equals the whole group). The latter is the Lean way of stating “G = Z” as subgroups of G.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If G/Z is cyclic, then G is abelian and hence G = Z.
- Lean hypothesis precisely encodes that G/Z is cyclic, using a generator that is the image of some g ∈ G and allowing integer exponents, which is standard for cyclic groups in group theory.
- Lean conclusions match “G is abelian” and “hence G = Z” (as Z = ⊤ in Subgroup G).

Step 3: Final check.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all constructs are standard Mathlib objects (center G as a Subgroup, QuotientGroup.mk, integer powers g ^ n).
- Using Int exponents is appropriate for cyclic groups (both finite and infinite cases are covered).
- The formulation with g ∈ G rather than directly an element of the quotient is equivalent, since a generator in the quotient has a preimage in G whose image generates the quotient.
- The second conclusion Z = ⊤ appropriately formalizes “G = Z.”

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the statement.

- `theorem nilpotent_quotient_ext (R : Type*) [CommRing R] (I J : Ideal R) (x : I ⊓ J) : IsNilpotent ((Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J)) x) := by sorry`
  This states: For a commutative ring R, ideals I and J of R, and an element x in the intersection I ∩ J, the image (residue) of x in the quotient ring R/(I*J) is nilpotent. Here, `Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J)` is the canonical projection R → R ⧸ (I * J), and `IsNilpotent` asserts nilpotency in the quotient. The argument `x : I ⊓ J` means x is an arbitrary element of the intersection; it is coerced to an element of R when passed to the quotient map.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: ""Let I, J be ideals in a ring R. Prove that the residue of any element of I ∩ J in R / I J is nilpotent.""
- The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: it universally quantifies over R, I, J, and an arbitrary element x of I ∩ J, and concludes that its image in R/(I*J) is nilpotent.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The only minor difference is that Lean assumes `[CommRing R]` (commutative ring), while the natural language says ""ring"" without explicit commutativity. This is a slight specialization, commonly acceptable in commutative algebra contexts, and the intended statement is typically in the commutative setting. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The target claim matches precisely.

  Natural language: Let p and r be natural numbers. Assume p is prime, r ≥ 1, and p = 2^r + 1. Then there exists k ∈ ℕ such that r = 2^k (i.e., r is a power of two).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural statement: “If a prime integer p has the form 2^r + 1, then it actually has the form 2^{2^k} + 1.” This is equivalent to saying r is a power of two, because from p = 2^r + 1 and r = 2^k, one gets p = 2^{2^k} + 1.
- The Lean theorem concludes r = 2^k under the hypothesis p = 2^r + 1, hence it implies the stated form for p immediately. So the content matches.
- The code includes `hr : 1 ≤ r`. This is a standard necessary restriction (otherwise r = 0 would give p = 2, which is prime but not of the form 2^{2^k} + 1). The informal statement omits this but typically intends r ≥ 1; the comment in the code explicitly includes it. This is an acceptable, standard refinement.
- The use of ℕ (natural numbers) for p matches “prime integer” for positive primes; this is a benign formalization detail.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement is given (with proof omitted), which is allowed per the instructions.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: existence of k such that p = 2^{2^k} + 1.
- Lean: existence of k such that r = 2^k, given p = 2^r + 1.
- These are equivalent under the given hypothesis hpform. The added r ≥ 1 assumption is a reasonable and customary condition and aligns with the textbook version noted in the comment. Hence the translation is faithful.

In Mathlib, `orderOf` is the (possibly infinite) order of an element, with `0` representing infinite order. The `sorry` means no proof is provided, but the statement itself precisely matches the intended proposition.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: If x and g are in a group G, then |x| = |g^{-1} x g|. The Lean statement is exactly `orderOf x = orderOf (g⁻¹ * x * g)`, which is the standard formalization of equality of orders under conjugation. The use of `orderOf` (Nat with 0 = infinite order) captures both finite and infinite cases; equality remains meaningful and faithful to the usual mathematical meaning.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that no group of order p^2 q, where p and q are prime, is simple.""
- A group being not simple (with |G| > 1, which holds since p and q are primes, so |G| ≥ 8) is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. The Lean statement explicitly asserts the existence of such a subgroup H. Thus it matches the intended meaning.
- The hypotheses match: G is finite; p, q are primes; |G| = p^2 q.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code states the existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, which is the standard characterization of ""not simple"" for nontrivial groups. Since |G| = p^2 q ≥ 8, G is certainly nontrivial, so the formulations are equivalent.
- The code does not require p and q to be distinct primes; the English statement does not explicitly state distinctness either. Even if p = q (order p^3), the conclusion is still true; thus the code is a valid slight generalization, not a mismatch.
- No auxiliary fake/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib.

- Conclusion `∀ m n : ℤ, x ^ m = x ^ n → m = n`: For all integers m, n, if x^m = x^n, then m = n. Equivalently, the map n ↦ x^n from ℤ to G is injective.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: If x has infinite order in G, then the elements x^n (n∈ℤ) are all distinct. The Lean hypothesis precisely encodes infinite order (no nonzero integer power gives 1), and the conclusion exactly states injectivity of n ↦ x^n, i.e., distinct exponents give distinct elements. Thus the formal statement is a faithful translation.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Scope: The natural language uses n ∈ ℤ; the Lean statement uses integer powers `x ^ n` with n : ℤ. Match.
- Definition of infinite order: The Lean version uses the standard equivalent condition that x^n = 1 implies n = 0 for all integers n, which is correct in a group. No extraneous assumptions.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The code’s theorem statement is a legitimate and faithful formalization of the given statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We fix a type `G` equipped with a group structure.
- In the theorem `no_subgroup_card_eq_card_sub_one (n : ℕ) (h_card : Fintype.card G = n) (hn : 2 < n) : ¬∃ (H : Subgroup G), Fintype.card H = n - 1`, the appearance of `Fintype.card G` implicitly requires and introduces a `[Fintype G]` instance, i.e. that `G` is finite. Thus the theorem assumes: G is a finite group of cardinality `n`, with `n > 2`.
- The conclusion `¬∃ (H : Subgroup G), Fintype.card H = n - 1` states: there does not exist a subgroup `H ≤ G` with order `n - 1`. The use of `Fintype.card H` similarly relies on the (automatically provided) instance that any subgroup of a finite group is finite.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Prove that G cannot have a subgroup H with |H| = n − 1, where n = |G| > 2.”
- Lean: Assumes `G` is a finite group with `|G| = n > 2`, and concludes there is no subgroup `H` with `|H| = n − 1`.
- This is a faithful formalization. The parameters and inequalities are identical (`n = Fintype.card G` and `2 < n`). The existential negation precisely matches “cannot have.” There are no extraneous or missing hypotheses.

Auxiliary definitions:
- None are introduced; no vacuous placeholders. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions: `Subgroup`, `Fintype.card`.

Final check:
- The Lean statement is essentially the same as the natural language statement. No differences in meaning or scope. The implicit `[Fintype G]` is exactly the finiteness required by the problem. Hence, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses mathlib definitions and notations.
- Comment states the goal: Q has no proper subgroups of finite index.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_2_21a : ∀ (H : AddSubgroup ℚ), H ≠ (⊤ : AddSubgroup ℚ) → ¬ Fintype (AddSubgroup.Quotient H) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every additive subgroup H of the rationals ℚ, if H is not the whole group (i.e., H is proper), then the quotient group ℚ/H is not finite (i.e., is not a finite type). Equivalently, there are infinitely many cosets of H in ℚ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural statement “ℚ has no proper subgroups of finite index” is equivalent to saying that for every proper subgroup H ≤ ℚ, the index [ℚ : H] is infinite. In mathlib, for (additive) groups, having finite index is equivalent to the coset quotient being a finite type, i.e., `Fintype (AddSubgroup.Quotient H)`. Thus, `¬ Fintype (AddSubgroup.Quotient H)` expresses that the index is not finite.
- The predicate `H ≠ ⊤` correctly encodes that H is proper.
- Using `AddSubgroup ℚ` matches ℚ as an additive group.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Original: “ℚ has no proper subgroups of finite index.”
- Lean: For every H, if H is proper, then the quotient ℚ/H is not finite. These are the same claim. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement stands directly. Proof omission is acceptable per instructions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- Comment: states the intended theorem, matching the natural language statement.
- `theorem subgroup_generated_by_remove_one {G : Type _} [Group G] (H : Subgroup G) : Subgroup.closure ((H : Set G) \ {1 : G}) = H := by sorry`
  • For any type G with a group structure and any subgroup H of G, the subgroup closure (i.e., subgroup generated) of the set consisting of elements of H with the identity element 1 removed equals H.
  • `(H : Set G)` is the underlying set of the subgroup H; `\` denotes set difference; `{1 : G}` is the singleton containing the identity; `Subgroup.closure` is the subgroup generated by a set.
  • `by sorry` omits the proof but the statement is clear and uses standard Mathlib notions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: if H is a subgroup of G, then H is generated by H − {1}. In formal terms, that means the subgroup generated by H \ {1} equals H. The Lean statement is exactly `Subgroup.closure (H \ {1}) = H`, which is the standard formalization of “H is generated by H − {1}.”

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement using standard Mathlib constructs.
- The meaning matches precisely, including edge cases (e.g., H = {1}, where closure of ∅ is the trivial subgroup).
- No material differences from the original statement.

In other words, the unit groups of the real and complex numbers are not isomorphic. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement concerns the multiplicative groups ℝ − {0} and ℂ − {0}. In Mathlib, for a field like ℝ or ℂ, `Units ℝ` (respectively `Units ℂ`) is precisely the group of all nonzero elements under multiplication, i.e., the same group as ℝ − {0} (resp. ℂ − {0}), just presented as units. There is a canonical identification between nonzero elements and units in a field. Thus `Units ℝ` and `Units ℂ` faithfully represent the intended groups.
- `¬ Nonempty (Units ℝ ≃* Units ℂ)` exactly means “there is no multiplicative group isomorphism between the two,” matching “are not isomorphic.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Representation: The code uses `Units ℝ` and `Units ℂ` instead of the subtype `{x | x ≠ 0}`. For fields, these are canonically the same group. No substantive difference.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof.
- Therefore, the formal statement matches the natural language statement.

theorem rotations_maximal {n : ℕ} : ∀ H : Subgroup (DihedralGroup n), H ≤ Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n} → H = Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n} ∨ H = ⊤ := by sorry
",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The statement declares a theorem `rotations_maximal {n : ℕ}` for any natural number n.
- It asserts: For any subgroup H of `DihedralGroup n`, if `H ≤ Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n}` (i.e., H is contained in the subgroup generated by the rotation r), then `H = Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n} ∨ H = ⊤` (i.e., H equals the rotation subgroup or H equals the whole group).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: “Show that the subgroup of all rotations in a dihedral group is a maximal subgroup.” In subgroup lattice terms, “maximal” means: if K is a subgroup with `Subgroup.closure {r} ≤ K ≤ ⊤`, then either `K = Subgroup.closure {r}` or `K = ⊤`.
- The Lean statement uses the implication in the wrong direction: it assumes `H ≤ Subgroup.closure {r}` rather than `Subgroup.closure {r} ≤ H`. This is not the right characterization of maximality; it actually restricts to subgroups below the rotation subgroup, not above it. The correct coatom/maximal formulation should quantify over supergroups of the rotation subgroup.
- The identification of the “subgroup of all rotations” with `Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n}` is appropriate, so that part is fine.
- However, as written, the statement is not equivalent to “maximal subgroup” and is in fact generally false/non-sensical: if `H ≤ Subgroup.closure {r}`, it is impossible for `H = ⊤` unless the rotation subgroup is itself `⊤`, which is not the general dihedral case.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code asserts a property about subgroups contained in the rotation subgroup, whereas maximality concerns subgroups containing the rotation subgroup.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the issue is the logical direction of the inclusion hypothesis. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Suggested correct shape: `∀ K : Subgroup (DihedralGroup n), Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n} ≤ K → K = Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n} ∨ K = ⊤`, or directly `IsCoatom (Subgroup.closure {DihedralGroup.r n})`.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library, providing group theory definitions and the quotient group machinery.
- Comment describes the goal: If A is an abelian group and B a subgroup, then A/B is abelian.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_1_3a {A : Type*} [CommGroup A] (B : Subgroup A) : CommGroup (A ⧸ B) := by sorry`
  - This declares a theorem with:
    - `A : Type*` a type.
    - `[CommGroup A]` meaning A is a commutative (abelian) group.
    - `B : Subgroup A` a subgroup of A.
  - Conclusion: `CommGroup (A ⧸ B)`, i.e., the quotient `A/B` (written `A ⧸ B` in Lean) carries a commutative group structure. In commutative groups, every subgroup is normal, so the quotient is well-defined.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: Let A be an abelian group and B a subgroup of A. Prove that A/B is abelian.
- The Lean theorem exactly asserts that if A is a commutative group and B is a subgroup, then the quotient `A ⧸ B` is a commutative group. This is precisely the formal version of the statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code directly states the theorem. While the proof is omitted (`sorry`), our task is to judge translation faithfulness, not proof completeness.

Final check:
- The mathematical content of both statements matches exactly. The use of multiplicative notation (`CommGroup`, `A ⧸ B`) instead of additive is standard and does not change meaning. There are no extra or missing hypotheses. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We work over a fixed commutative ring R (with 1) in Mathlib.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_10_7_10 (M : Ideal R) (hM : M ≠ ⊤) (h : ∀ x : R, x ∉ M → IsUnit x) : M.IsMaximal ∧ ∀ I : Ideal R, I.IsMaximal → I = M := by sorry`
  Translation: Let M be an ideal of a commutative ring R. Assume (i) M is proper (M ≠ ⊤) and (ii) every element of R not in M is a unit. Then M is a maximal ideal and, moreover, any maximal ideal I equals M (so M is the unique maximal ideal).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Let R be a ring, with M an ideal of R. Suppose that every element of R which is not in M is a unit of R. Prove that M is a maximal ideal and that moreover it is the only maximal ideal of R.""
- The Lean theorem matches the logical content of the conclusion: it asserts that M is maximal and is the only maximal ideal.
- Assumptions: The Lean version assumes R is a commutative ring (CommRing) and explicitly assumes M ≠ ⊤. The original text says just ""ring"" (not explicitly commutative) and does not explicitly state M ≠ R.
  - Commutativity: This is a standard setting for ideals and maximal ideals in commutative algebra. The result is typically stated for commutative rings, so this is a reasonable specialization.
  - Properness (M ≠ ⊤): Mathlib's `IsMaximal` requires M to be proper. The original statement, as written, would be false if M = R (the premise is vacuously true, but ⊤ is not maximal), so the implicit intended meaning is that M is proper. Thus adding `hM : M ≠ ⊤` is a mild and natural clarification rather than a distortion.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Same core mathematical claim: Under the condition that all elements outside M are units, M is maximal and unique among maximal ideals.
- Differences:
  - Lean assumes commutativity; the natural statement did not specify. This is a standard context and acceptable specialization.
  - Lean explicitly assumes M ≠ ⊤; the natural statement omits this but implicitly needs it. This is an extra hypothesis but one that aligns with the intended meaning and with Mathlib's definition of maximal ideal.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement uses standard Mathlib notions (`Ideal`, `IsUnit`, `Ideal.IsMaximal`).

Overall, the code is a faithful formalization with a standard and necessary explicit properness assumption and the typical commutative ring context.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `theorem inv_map_is_hom_iff_comm {G : Type _} [Group G] : ...` declares a theorem for an arbitrary type G equipped with a group structure.
- Left side: `(∀ x y : G, (x * y)⁻¹ = x⁻¹ * y⁻¹)` states that the inversion map g ↦ g⁻¹ is a homomorphism, i.e., it preserves the group multiplication in the order given: inv(xy) = inv x * inv y.
- Right side: `(∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x)` states that G is abelian (commutative).
- The theorem asserts the equivalence (↔) between these two properties.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement: “Let G be any group. Prove that the map from G to itself defined by g ↦ g⁻¹ is a homomorphism if and only if G is abelian.”
- The code’s left side exactly formalizes “the inversion map is a homomorphism.”
- The code’s right side exactly formalizes “G is abelian.”
- No extraneous assumptions or weakened conditions are introduced; the equivalence is stated as in the problem.
- Using the pointwise condition for homomorphism instead of an explicit MonoidHom structure is standard and equivalent in this context, and does not change the mathematical meaning.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The statement matches the intended equivalence precisely.
- No subtle mismatch (e.g., anti-hom vs hom) occurs: the left side uses x⁻¹ * y⁻¹, which is the hom condition, aligning with the iff-to-abelian claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- The theorem statement: `theorem not_isGroup_ZMod_multiplication (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) : ¬IsGroup (ZMod n) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n with 1 < n, it asserts that ZMod n is not a group, where ""IsGroup (ZMod n)"" is intended to mean ""Z/nZ is a group (presumably with its multiplication).""

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: “for all n > 1, Z/nZ is not a group under multiplication of residue classes.” This specifically refers to the multiplicative structure of ZMod n.
- In Lean/mathlib, there is no standard Prop called `IsGroup` that asserts a type is a group with its existing multiplication. The usual way is via the typeclass `[Group α]`, or to assert nonexistence via `¬ Nonempty (Group α)` or to phrase explicitly that the existing multiplication fails group axioms. Using `IsGroup` is nonstandard and likely nonexistent in Mathlib.
- Because the code uses a likely non-existent/non-standard predicate `IsGroup`, it does not clearly or legitimately tie to “under multiplication of residue classes.” Even if `IsGroup` existed, it would need to be defined to mean “the existing multiplication on ZMod n forms a group,” which is nonstandard and not shown here.
- Thus, the formal statement is not a legitimate Mathlib formulation of the intended claim. It fails the guideline that the code should use applicable Mathlib terms, and it relies on a dubious predicate. There are no auxiliary definitions here, but the central predicate is likely fabricated/misused.

Final comparison:
- Intended: “For n > 1, ZMod n is not a group under multiplication.”
- Formal: “For n > 1, ¬IsGroup (ZMod n).” This is ambiguous and likely ill-formed in Mathlib. It does not explicitly refer to the multiplicative structure and uses a nonstandard predicate.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

The natural language statement says: ""Prove that subgroups of a solvable group are solvable."" The theorem precisely asserts that if G is a solvable group, then any subgroup H of G is solvable. There are no extraneous hypotheses or restrictions; the formalization uses the standard Mathlib notions `Group`, `Subgroup`, and `IsSolvable`.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context `{G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G]` specifies that G is a finite group.
- The hypothesis `hcomp : ∃ a b : ℕ, 1 < a ∧ 1 < b ∧ Fintype.card G = a * b` states that the order of G is composite: there exist natural numbers a and b both greater than 1 such that |G| = a*b.
- The hypothesis `hsub : ∀ k : ℕ, k ∣ Fintype.card G → ∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = k` says that for every natural number k dividing |G|, there exists a subgroup H of G with order k. Since 0 ∣ |G| is false for positive |G|, this effectively ranges over positive divisors, matching the natural language statement.
- The conclusion `∃ N : Subgroup G, N.normal ∧ N ≠ ⊥ ∧ N ≠ ⊤` asserts the existence of a normal subgroup N of G which is neither the trivial subgroup ⊥ nor the whole group ⊤, i.e., G is not simple.

Faithfulness check to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: G is finite, of composite order n, and has a subgroup of order k for each positive k dividing n; prove G is not simple.
- The Lean code exactly encodes: finite group, composite order (via existence of a,b>1 with product equal to |G|), the subgroup existence for each divisor k of |G|, and concludes there exists a proper, nontrivial normal subgroup. This matches “G is not simple.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines are just setup.
- The theorem states: For any finite group G with Fintype.card G = 200, there exists a unique subgroup H of G such that Fintype.card H = 5.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The original statement: ""Prove that a group of order 200 has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup.""
- In a group of order 200 = 2^3 * 5^2, a Sylow 5-subgroup has order 5^2 = 25. The natural language claim is the existence of a normal subgroup of order 25 (equivalently, a normal Sylow 5-subgroup). Normality implies uniqueness among Sylow 5-subgroups (and thus among subgroups of order 25), but the key target is order 25 and normality.

3) Discrepancies:
- The Lean theorem claims existence and uniqueness of a subgroup of order 5, not 25. This is the wrong order for a Sylow 5-subgroup in a group of order 200.
- It asserts uniqueness explicitly (∃!), which is strictly stronger than simply existence of a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. While uniqueness among subgroups of order 25 would imply normality of that Sylow subgroup, the code speaks about order 5, not 25.
- The code does not mention normality or Sylow; it only asserts a unique subgroup of a given (incorrect) order. Even if we ignore uniqueness, the target order is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is not a faithful formalization. A closer faithful Lean statement would be something like: `∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = 25 ∧ IsNormal H`, or equivalently `∃! H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = 25`.

Final check: The two statements are different. The Lean code claims a unique subgroup of order 5, whereas the original requires existence of a normal subgroup of order 25. Hence, not faithful.

",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Function`: standard imports; no effect on the mathematical content.
- The docstring restates the natural language statement: for elements x,y in a group G, prove xy=yx iff y^{-1}xy=x iff x^{-1}y^{-1}xy=1.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem xy_eq_yx_iff_yx_eq_xy_iff_x_inv_y_inv_xy_eq_one {G : Type*} [Group G] (x y : G) : x * y = y * x ↔ y⁻¹ * x * y = x ↔ x⁻¹ * y⁻¹ * x * y = 1 := by sorry`
  Interpreting the statement: it asserts `x * y = y * x ↔ (y⁻¹ * x * y = x ↔ x⁻¹ * y⁻¹ * x * y = 1)` because in Lean, chaining `↔` without parentheses is parsed as a right-associative `↔`, i.e., `A ↔ B ↔ C` means `A ↔ (B ↔ C)`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement intends a three-way equivalence: xy = yx if and only if y^{-1}xy = x, and that in turn is equivalent to x^{-1}y^{-1}xy = 1. Formally, one would express this as two separate equivalences, e.g., `(xy = yx ↔ y^{-1}xy = x) ∧ (y^{-1}xy = x ↔ x^{-1}y^{-1}xy = 1)`, or equivalently that all three propositions are pairwise equivalent.
- The Lean code, however, states `x*y = y*x ↔ (y⁻¹*x*y = x ↔ x⁻¹*y⁻¹*x*y = 1)`. This is a different proposition. In fact, because in a group the statements `y⁻¹xy = x` and `x⁻¹y⁻¹xy = 1` are always logically equivalent (each implies the other by simple group manipulations), the middle parenthesized term `(B ↔ C)` is always true. Thus the Lean statement reduces logically to `A ↔ True`, i.e., just `A`, asserting commutativity `xy = yx` unconditionally, which is not the intended (and is false in general). Therefore, the code does not faithfully capture the intended three-way equivalence.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: three statements A, B, C are mutually equivalent (expressed as a chain of iff’s).
- Lean code: A is equivalent to (B iff C), i.e. `A ↔ (B ↔ C)`, which is not the same as the chain equivalence and in fact collapses to asserting A because `B ↔ C` is always true in a group.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the issue is purely the incorrect logical structuring of the statement due to missing parentheses/structuring for a three-way equivalence.

Conclusion: Not faithful. A correct formalization would use either `(x*y = y*x ↔ y⁻¹*x*y = x) ∧ (y⁻¹*x*y = x ↔ x⁻¹*y⁻¹*x*y = 1)` or present the equivalences separately.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {A : Type*} [Fintype A] [DecidableEq A]`: A is a finite type (finite set) with decidable equality.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] [MulAction G A]`: G is a finite group acting (on the left) on A.
- The theorem `exists_derangement_of_transitive (htrans : ∀ a b : A, ∃ g : G, g • a = b) (h_card : Fintype.card A > 1) : ∃ g : G, ∀ a : A, g • a ≠ a` says: If the action of G on A is transitive (for any a, b in A there exists g sending a to b) and |A| > 1, then there exists an element g in G with no fixed points (for all a in A, g • a ≠ a). This is exactly the existence of a derangement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: ""Let G be a transitive permutation group on the finite set A with |A|>1. Show there is σ ∈ G with σ(a) ≠ a for all a ∈ A."" 
- Lean: Assumes a finite group G acting transitively on finite A with |A|>1, and concludes existence of an element with no fixed points. This matches the statement.

Step 3: Compare potential differences.
- The code uses a general group action (`MulAction G A`) rather than explicitly a subgroup of Sym(A). This is a slight generalization (faithfulness of the action is not assumed), but it does not alter the mathematical content for this result—derangements exist in this generality as well, and a permutation group is a special case.
- The code assumes `[Fintype G]`. In the natural statement, a ""permutation group on a finite set"" implies G ≤ Sym(A), hence finite, so this is consistent. The DecidableEq assumption is a harmless technicality.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (slight generalization) of the natural language statement.

  • G is a type with a group structure, and G is finite (there is an instance `[Fintype G]`).
  • H is a subgroup of G.
  • Hypothesis `uniq`: For every subgroup K of G, if the cardinality of K equals the cardinality of H (both finite), then K = H. In other words, H is the unique subgroup of G among those with the same finite order as H.
  • Conclusion: H is characteristic in G (`H.IsCharacteristic`), i.e., invariant under all automorphisms of G.
  • The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for our translation check.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If H is the unique subgroup of a given order in a group G prove H is characteristic in G.""
- The Lean hypothesis `uniq` matches “H is the unique subgroup of a given order,” taking that order to be |H|. It formalizes uniqueness among all subgroups of G whose order equals |H|.
- The conclusion matches: H is characteristic in G.

3) Final check: sameness or differences:
- The Lean statement assumes `[Fintype G]` (G finite). The natural language statement does not explicitly assume G is finite, only that H has a given order (typically a finite integer). The proof in general does not require G to be finite; it suffices that the order in question is finite. Hence, the code is a slight specialization (stronger hypothesis) than the general statement.
- Aside from this extra finiteness assumption on G, the mathematical content matches: uniqueness of H among subgroups of the specified order implies H is characteristic.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is precise and uses standard Mathlib concepts (`Subgroup`, `Fintype.card`, `IsCharacteristic`).

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful, with a minor specialization (assuming G finite). This is acceptable per the guidelines.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_1_22b {G : Type*} [Group G] {ι : Sort*} (S : ι → Subgroup G)`
  Introduces a group `G`, an arbitrary index type `ι`, and a family `S` of subgroups of `G` indexed by `ι`.
- `(hne : Nonempty ι)`
  Assumes the index set `ι` is nonempty, i.e., the collection of subgroups is nonempty.
- `(hnormal : ∀ (i : ι) (g h : G), h ∈ (S i) → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ (S i))`
  Assumes each `S i` is normal by explicitly requiring closure under conjugation for every `g ∈ G` and all `h ∈ S i`.
- Conclusion:
  ` (∀ a b, a ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)) → b ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)) → a * b ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)))`
  The intersection of the underlying sets of the subgroups is closed under multiplication.
  ` ∧ (1 ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)))`
  The identity element is in the intersection.
  ` ∧ (∀ x, x ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)) → x⁻¹ ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)))`
  The intersection is closed under inverses.
  ` ∧ (∀ g x, x ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)) → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ (⋂ i, (S i : Set G)))`
  The intersection is closed under conjugation by arbitrary `g`.
  Together, these four properties exactly assert that the intersection is a normal subgroup (as a set with subgroup axioms and normality), even though it is not explicitly packaged as a `Subgroup`/`Normal` object.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: the intersection of an arbitrary nonempty collection of normal subgroups of a group is a normal subgroup, with no countability assumption. The Lean code models:
  - An arbitrary index type `ι` (no countability restriction),
  - Nonemptiness of the collection via `Nonempty ι`,
  - Each `S i` is a subgroup (since `S i : Subgroup G`) and is normal (via `hnormal`),
  - The conclusion that the intersection of the underlying sets satisfies the subgroup axioms and is closed under conjugation.
- This is essentially the same mathematical content. The decision to state closure properties on the set-theoretic intersection, rather than constructing an explicit `Subgroup`/`Normal` structure, is a standard and faithful way to formulate the result.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced, and there are no extraneous assumptions (the nonemptiness assumption matches the given natural language; in fact the result also holds without it, but requiring it is consistent with the statement).

Final comparison:
- The two statements match in meaning: a nonempty family of normal subgroups’ intersection is (set-theoretically) a subgroup and normal. No discrepancy in scope or strength, and no hidden restrictions like countability.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- The theorem `abelian_simple_group_is_zp` is stated for a type `G` with `[Group G] [CommGroup G]`, i.e., an abelian group structure on `G` (the `[Group G]` is redundant but harmless).
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ H : Subgroup G, H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤`: This asserts that the only subgroups of `G` are the trivial subgroup and the whole group. Note this quantifies over all subgroups (not just normal ones), but in an abelian group this is equivalent to quantifying over normal subgroups since all subgroups are normal.
- Conclusion: `∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ Nonempty (G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p))`. This says there exists a prime number `p` and a group isomorphism between `G` and `Multiplicative (ZMod p)`. Interpreting `Z_p` as the cyclic group of order `p` (additively), using `Multiplicative (ZMod p)` is the standard way in Lean to view the additive group of `ZMod p` as a multiplicative group, so this matches the intended target up to notation.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: ""If G is an abelian simple group then G ≅ Z_p for some prime p (do not assume G is finite).""
- The Lean code encodes ""abelian"" correctly via `[CommGroup G]`.
- It encodes ""simple"" as `∀ H : Subgroup G, H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤`. In an abelian group, this is equivalent to having no nontrivial proper normal subgroups, except for one important detail: the standard definition of a simple group includes nontriviality. The current Lean hypothesis does not assert `Nontrivial G`. As a result, the trivial group satisfies `h` (since its only subgroup is both `⊥` and `⊤`), but is not isomorphic to `ZMod p` for any prime `p`. Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly stronger than the intended hypothesis in one aspect (it demands the property for all subgroups rather than just normal ones, which is fine in the abelian case), but crucially weaker in another: it omits the nontriviality condition inherent in ""simple group"".

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean code is missing the nontriviality assumption implicit in ""simple group"". Consequently, it claims the conclusion even for the trivial group (which satisfies the given `h`), which would be false. Everything else (abelian assumption, target isomorphism to Z_p) matches well, and the use of `Multiplicative (ZMod p)` is an acceptable formal stand-in for `Z_p`.

Given this single but significant discrepancy, the translation is almost correct but not faithful.

  Natural language: For any type G equipped with a group structure and a finite cardinality, if the cardinality of G equals 132, then G is not a simple group. Here, `¬ SimpleGroup G` formalizes “G is not simple.” The hypothesis `(h : Fintype.card G = 132)` formalizes “|G| = 132.”

The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted (which is acceptable per the task since we only audit the statement).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that characteristic subgroups are normal.""
- The Lean statement exactly captures this: if H is a characteristic subgroup of G, then H is normal.

- The math problems are the same. The Lean theorem states the general implication for any group and any subgroup, matching the natural language statement. There are no additional restrictions or generalizations beyond the intended meaning.

Potential technical notes (do not affect faithfulness):
- Implicit parameters `{G} [Group G]` are inferred from `(H : Subgroup G)`. This is standard and does not alter meaning.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: We use Mathlib, which provides the standard definitions, including groups, subgroups, and Sylow subgroups.
- variable {G : Type*} [Group G] {p : ℕ} {P H : Subgroup G}: We work in a group G, with a natural number p, and two subgroups P and H of G.
- open Subgroup: Open the Subgroup namespace for convenience.
- The theorem statement:

    IsSylow p H (Subgroup.comap (H.subtype : H →* G) P) := by sorry
  Natural language: If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G (hP), and P is contained in H (hPsub), then the comap of P along the inclusion homomorphism H → G is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. The comap here is exactly the subgroup of H consisting of those elements whose image in G lies in P; under the assumption P ≤ H, this comap is precisely P viewed as a subgroup of H.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement
Original statement: If P ∈ Syl_p(G) and H is a subgroup of G containing P, then P ∈ Syl_p(H).
- Lean uses IsSylow p G P to mean “P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G,” which matches P ∈ Syl_p(G).
- The condition P ≤ H matches “H contains P”.
- The conclusion uses Subgroup.comap (H.subtype) P, which is the standard way in Lean to view the subgroup P of G as a subgroup of H via the inclusion homomorphism. Under P ≤ H this comap is exactly P (as a subgroup of H). So the conclusion IsSylow p H (comap ...) says “P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H,” matching the original statement.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness
- No auxiliary fake/vacuous definitions are introduced. IsSylow and Subgroup.comap are genuine Mathlib concepts.
- The only technical difference is the formalization detail of using comap to transport P from Subgroup G to Subgroup H, which is necessary in Lean’s type theory and faithful to the intended meaning under the hypothesis P ≤ H.
- Any implicit finiteness/prime assumptions tied to IsSylow are handled by Mathlib and do not affect the faithfulness of the translation.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- K : Type*, [Field K]; V : Type*, [AddCommGroup V], [Module K V]: V is a vector space over the field K.
- S : Set V, hS : S.Countable: S is a countable subset of V.
- hspan : Submodule.span K S = ⊤: the span of S is all of V, i.e., S spans V.
- The theorem states: For all L : Set V, if L is linearly independent (expressed as LinearIndependent K (fun x : L => (x : V)) for the subtype inclusion), then L.Finite ∨ L.Countable.

This exactly says: every linearly independent subset L of V is finite or countable, under the assumption that V is spanned by a countable set S.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural statement: Let V be a vector space which is spanned by a countably infinite set. Prove that every linearly independent subset of V is finite or countably infinite.

- Hypothesis: The Lean code assumes S.Countable; the natural language says “countably infinite.” The Lean hypothesis is slightly more general (allows S finite). This is a benign generalization; the conclusion remains valid and the theorem still implies the intended statement when S is countably infinite. The form “given S with these properties” is also fine: the NL statement asserts existence of such S; the Lean theorem holds for any such S satisfying the properties, which implies the NL statement.
- Conclusion: The Lean conclusion is L.Finite ∨ L.Countable. In Mathlib, Countable includes finite sets, so the disjunction is logically equivalent to “L.Countable.” The NL statement says “finite or countably infinite,” which is also equivalent to “countable.” Hence the meanings coincide.
- Linear independence over K of a subset L is correctly expressed via LinearIndependent K (fun x : L => (x : V)).

Step 3: Final check
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The only difference is the slightly weaker hypothesis (countable vs countably infinite), which is an acceptable generalization and does not change the essence of the result.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language statement (indeed slightly generalizes it in a standard, acceptable way).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, giving access to groups, subgroups, quotient cosets, cardinals, etc.
- Comment: States the intent to express indices as cardinalities of quotient types `Cardinal.mk (G ⧸ H)`.
- `theorem index_mul {G : Type*} [Group G] {H K : Subgroup G} (hHK : H ≤ K) : ... := by sorry`
  - Here, `G` is a group, and `H, K` are subgroups of `G`.
  - The hypothesis `hHK : H ≤ K` asserts `H` is a subgroup of `K`.
  - The statement: `Cardinal.mk (G ⧸ H) = Cardinal.mk (G ⧸ K) * Cardinal.mk (K ⧸ H)`.
    - `Cardinal.mk (G ⧸ H)` denotes the cardinality of the set of left cosets of `H` in `G`, i.e., the (possibly infinite) index `|G : H|`.
    - `Cardinal.mk (G ⧸ K)` is `|G : K|`.
    - `Cardinal.mk (K ⧸ H)` is intended to be the index of `H` in `K`, i.e., `|K : H|` (viewing `K` as a group and `H` as a subgroup of `K` via `H ≤ K`).
  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For subgroups `H ≤ K ≤ G`, prove `|G:H| = |G:K| * |K:H|` without assuming finiteness.
- The code sets `H, K : Subgroup G`, so both are already subgroups of `G` (capturing the implicit `K ≤ G`), and assumes `H ≤ K` explicitly.
- The equality is expressed in terms of cardinalities of coset spaces, matching the intended meaning of indices (possibly infinite), and uses cardinal multiplication. This faithfully represents the statement ""do not assume G is finite"".
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only the theorem signature is given.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is essentially the same as the original: it asserts the multiplicativity of indices `|G:H| = |G:K| * |K:H|` in full generality (no finiteness assumed) via cardinals of coset spaces.
- Minor technicality: in an actual formalization one would ensure `K ⧸ H` refers to cosets of `H` in `K` (viewing `H` as a subgroup of `K` using `H ≤ K`). Conceptually, that is exactly what is written and intended here.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem boolean_ring_comm {R : Type*} [Ring R] (h : ∀ a : R, a * a = a) : ∀ x y : R, x * y = y * x := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with a ring structure, if every element is idempotent multiplicatively (a*a = a for all a in R), then for all x,y in R, multiplication commutes (x*y = y*x).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypothesis `(h : ∀ a : R, a * a = a)` exactly encodes the definition of a Boolean ring given in the problem statement.
- The conclusion `∀ x y : R, x * y = y * x` is precisely the commutativity of multiplication in R.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem directly mirrors the natural language claim.

3) Final comparison:
- The only potential nuance is that `[Ring R]` in Mathlib assumes a unital ring, while some contexts define rings without 1. Dummit & Foote use rings with 1, matching the code’s setting. Even if the original statement were agnostic about 1, this is at most a harmless specialization, which is acceptable per the guidelines.
- Otherwise, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of: ""Every Boolean ring is commutative.""

Here `X` is the standard polynomial indeterminate in Mathlib, the coefficients are integers, and `Irreducible` is the standard notion for elements of the ring ℤ[X]. The `: Polynomial ℤ` annotation fixes the coefficient ring to ℤ. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for checking statement faithfulness.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the math library.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_1_6` states: There does not exist an element `f` in `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` (the ring of polynomials in two commuting variables over ℚ) such that the ideal generated by `{MvPolynomial.X 0, MvPolynomial.X 1}` equals the ideal generated by `{f}`. Here `MvPolynomial.X (0 : Fin 2)` and `MvPolynomial.X (1 : Fin 2)` denote the two indeterminates x and y. `Ideal.span` constructs the ideal generated by a set. Thus the statement is ¬ ∃ f, (x, y) = (f).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: Prove that (x, y) is not a principal ideal in ℚ[x, y].
- The Lean statement formalizes exactly: the ideal generated by the two variables in ℚ[x, y] (modeled as `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ`) is not equal to the ideal generated by a single element, i.e., it is not principal.
- Using `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` is a standard and faithful formalization of ℚ[x, y]. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement with the proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypothesis exactly matches “an integer is the sum of two rational squares”: ∃ a b : ℚ, a^2 + b^2 = (n : ℚ). Lean’s implicit coercion from ℤ to ℚ ensures the equation is in ℚ, which is precisely what the natural language means.

- There are no extra assumptions or weakened conditions.
- No auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

- `GaussianInt ⧸ (Ideal.span ...)` is the quotient ring ℤ[i]/(1+i).
- `IsField (GaussianInt ⧸ ...)` asserts that this quotient ring is a field.
- `Fintype (GaussianInt ⧸ ...)` asserts that the quotient ring has finitely many elements.
- `Fintype.card (GaussianInt ⧸ ...) = 2` asserts that the number of elements in this quotient ring is 2.

The natural language statement says: “Prove that the quotient ring ℤ[i]/(1 + i) is a field of order 2.” The Lean statement says exactly that: the quotient by the ideal generated by 1 + i is a field and has cardinality 2. Including `Fintype` is redundant but harmless and consistent with asserting finiteness.

3) Final check of equivalence:

  says: H is normal in G if and only if the subgroup generated by all elements of the form g * h * g⁻¹ * h⁻¹ (with g ∈ G and h ∈ H) is contained in H. Here `Subgroup.closure` is the subgroup generated by the given set, and `≤` is subgroup inclusion.
  The set `{ g * (h : G) * g⁻¹ * (h : G)⁻¹ | g : G, h : H } : Set G` is exactly the set of commutators [g, h] with g ∈ G and h ∈ H, coerced to G from h : H.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that a subgroup H of G is normal if and only if [G, H] ≤ H.” Here [G, H] denotes the commutator subgroup generated by all commutators [g, h] with g ∈ G and h ∈ H.
- The Lean code encodes [G, H] as `Subgroup.closure` of the set of such commutators and asserts exactly that this subgroup is contained in H, iff H is normal.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let G be a finite group with elements g1, ..., gn. Define N = g1 + ... + gn in the group ring RG. Prove N is central.
- The code models RG as `MonoidAlgebra R G`, assumes G is finite (`[Fintype G]`), and defines N as the sum over all g in G of the canonical basis elements, which corresponds exactly to g1 + ... + gn. The centrality claim is exactly `N ∈ Center (MonoidAlgebra R G)`. This is a faithful translation.

3) Comparison and potential differences:
- The code uses `Fintype G` and `Finset.univ` rather than explicitly listing g1, ..., gn; this is the standard formalization of a finite group and is equivalent.
- The base ring R is assumed commutative (`[CommRing R]`), which is a standard setting for group rings and a slight specialization that does not change the intended statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; `N` is properly defined using mathlib's `MonoidAlgebra.of` and `Finset.sum`. The theorem matches the desired claim. The missing proof is acceptable per the task instructions.

- `open Ideal`: Open the Ideal namespace.
- `theorem ideal_isNilpotent_extracted (p m : ℕ) : IsNilpotent (Ideal.span {p : ZMod (p ^ m)}) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For natural numbers p and m, in the ring ZMod (p^m) = ℤ/(p^m)ℤ, the ideal generated by the element p (i.e., the class of p mod p^m) is nilpotent. Here `Ideal.span {p : ZMod (p^m)}` denotes the principal ideal generated by the residue class of p. `IsNilpotent` for ideals means there exists n ≥ 1 with the n-th power of the ideal equal to the zero ideal.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to prove that the ideal p ℤ / p^m ℤ in the ring ℤ / p^m ℤ is nilpotent. In ℤ/(p^m)ℤ, the ideal p ℤ / p^m ℤ is precisely the ideal generated by the residue class of p, i.e., `Ideal.span {p}` in `ZMod (p^m)`. Thus the Lean statement exactly captures the intended ideal and property (nilpotent ideal).

3) Final check and differences:
- The code uses `ZMod (p^m)` for ℤ / p^m ℤ, and `Ideal.span {p}` for the ideal generated by p mod p^m, which matches p ℤ / p^m ℤ.
- `IsNilpotent` on ideals matches the definition: some power of the ideal equals the zero ideal.
- The code allows any natural p and m (including possibly m = 0), which is a harmless slight generalization; the natural language did not explicitly require p to be prime nor explicitly state m ≥ 1, though typically m ≥ 1 is assumed. This does not harm faithfulness.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the only missing part is the proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

  Natural language: For any type R equipped with a commutative ring structure and with no zero divisors, and for any element x in R, if x^2 = 1, then x = 1 or x = -1. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""If R is an integral domain and x^2 = 1 for some x in R, then x = ±1.""
- Lean assumptions: `[CommRing R] [NoZeroDivisors R]`. This corresponds to a commutative ring with no zero divisors; it does not explicitly assume `1 ≠ 0` (i.e., nontriviality). An integral domain in standard usage is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and `1 ≠ 0`. Thus the Lean statement is a slight generalization (it allows the zero ring), but the conclusion remains correct in that case as well. The core mathematical content—no zero divisors implies from x^2=1 that (x−1)(x+1)=0 hence x=1 or x=−1—is precisely captured.
- The conclusion ""x = ±1"" is faithfully rendered as `x = 1 ∨ x = -1`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement appears.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical problems are essentially the same; the Lean version slightly generalizes the hypothesis from ""integral domain"" to ""commutative ring with no zero divisors"" (possibly allowing 1=0). This is acceptable as a faithful translation since it proves a stronger statement and does not weaken the intended result. There are no mismatches in the main claim or quantification over x. The code compiles (with a sorry for the proof), and uses standard Mathlib typeclasses appropriately.

- The natural language statement: “Let G be a group of order 105. Prove that if a Sylow 3-subgroup of G is normal then G is abelian.”
- In a group of order 105 = 3·5·7, a Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3. Thus, “a Sylow 3-subgroup is normal” is equivalent to “there exists a normal subgroup of order 3.” The hypothesis h3_normal: ∃ H, card H = 3 ∧ Normal H precisely matches this.
- Conclusion “G is abelian” is expressed as ∀ x y, x*y = y*x, which is the standard pointwise characterization of abelian groups.
- The cardinality condition is exactly |G| = 105 via h_card.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly encodes the problem.

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumption equivalence: For |G| = 105, any subgroup of order 3 is necessarily Sylow 3, so “∃ normal H of order 3” is precisely “a Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.” No mismatch.
- Conclusion equivalence: “G is abelian” ↔ “∀ x y, x*y = y*x.” Correct.
- Scope and generality: Matches exactly the group order and the specific Sylow condition. No generalization or specialization beyond the original.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial`: bring in Mathlib and open the `Polynomial` namespace. No issue.
- The theorem states: `Irreducible ((Polynomial.X : Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)) ^ 2 + Polynomial.C ((Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℚ) ^ 2 - 1))`.
  • Here, the ambient ring is `Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)`, i.e., polynomials in an outer indeterminate (call it x) with coefficients in `Polynomial ℚ` (polynomials in an inner indeterminate, call it y).
  • `(Polynomial.X : Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ))` denotes the outer variable x. So `(Polynomial.X)^2` is x^2.
  • `(Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℚ)` denotes the inner variable y. Then `((Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℚ) ^ 2 - 1)` is the element y^2 − 1 in the coefficient ring `Polynomial ℚ`.
  • `Polynomial.C` is the coefficient embedding `Polynomial ℚ → Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)`, making y^2 − 1 into a constant polynomial in x. Thus `Polynomial.C ((Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℚ) ^ 2 - 1)` is y^2 − 1 (viewed in the outer ring).
  • Therefore the whole polynomial is x^2 + (y^2 − 1) = x^2 + y^2 − 1 in `Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)`.
  • The statement `Irreducible (...)` claims that this polynomial is irreducible in `Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that x^2 + y^2 − 1 is irreducible in Q[x,y].”
- Viewing Q[x,y] as `Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)` (polynomials in x with coefficients in Q[y]) is standard and faithful. The constructed element is exactly x^2 + y^2 − 1 under this identification. The predicate `Irreducible` is Mathlib’s actual notion of irreducibility. No placeholders are used.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem’s statement precisely encodes the intended polynomial and the ring Q[x,y] via `Polynomial (Polynomial ℚ)`. Irreducibility in Q[x,y] is preserved under the canonical isomorphism, and Mathlib often takes Q[x,y] definitionally as such. Hence the code is a faithful translation of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement matches the natural language statement exactly; no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_normal_Sylow_of_card_eq_mul_three_primes {G : Type*} [Group G] {p q r : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] [Fact q.Prime] [Fact r.Prime] [Fintype G] (card_G : Nat.card G = p * q * r) (hpq : p < q) (hqr : q < r) :` sets up a finite group G with order |G| = p*q*r, where p, q, r are primes with p < q < r.
- The conclusion is `∃ P, Normal P ∧ Sylow p ↥P ∨ ∃ Q, Normal Q ∧ Sylow q ↥Q ∨ ∃ R, Normal R ∧ Sylow r ↥R`.
  Interpreting this: it asserts that either
  • there exists a subgroup P of G which is normal in G and (some assertion) `Sylow p ↥P`, or
  • there exists a subgroup Q of G which is normal in G and `Sylow q ↥Q`, or
  • there exists a subgroup R of G which is normal in G and `Sylow r ↥R`.

  Here `Normal P` is a standard Prop meaning P is normal in G. The term `↥P` is the underlying type of the subgroup P viewed as a group. The expression `Sylow p ↥P` denotes the (mathlib) type of Sylow p-subgroups of the group P, not a proposition about P itself. Thus the conjunction `Normal P ∧ Sylow p ↥P` pairs a proposition with a type, which is not the usual way to state a property; even if it were coerced somehow (e.g. as Nonempty (Sylow p ↥P)), it still would only assert that P (as a group) has a p-Sylow subgroup, which is standard Sylow theory about P itself, not that P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The intended statement is: If |G| = p q r with p < q < r primes, then G has a normal Sylow subgroup for one of p, q, r. In formal terms, one expects something like: `(∃ P : Subgroup G, P.Normal ∧ IsSylow P p) ∨ (∃ Q : Subgroup G, Q.Normal ∧ IsSylow Q q) ∨ (∃ R : Subgroup G, R.Normal ∧ IsSylow R r)` or equivalently `(∃ P : Sylow p G, (P : Subgroup G).Normal) ∨ ...`.
- The provided Lean conclusion instead speaks about the existence of a normal subgroup P and a Sylow p-subgroup of the group P (i.e., of P as a standalone finite group). That is not the same as saying P itself is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and normal in G. It is a much weaker and different statement; any nontrivial finite group P whose order is divisible by p has a Sylow p-subgroup internally, but that says nothing about being Sylow in G.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean code does not assert the existence of a normal p-, q-, or r-Sylow subgroup of G. It only asserts the existence of a normal subgroup that has an internal Sylow subgroup of a certain prime within that subgroup. The correct formalization should use a predicate asserting that the subgroup is Sylow in G (e.g., `IsSylow P p`) or quantify over `Sylow p G` and assert normality in G of that subgroup. Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Additional remarks:
- There are no vacuous placeholder definitions; the issues lie purely in the incorrect target statement.
- Even typing-wise, `Normal P ∧ Sylow p ↥P` is suspicious because `Sylow p ↥P` is a Type, not a Prop; so as written it likely does not express a meaningful proposition in mathlib. A meaningful but still incorrect variant would be `Normal P ∧ Nonempty (Sylow p ↥P)`.

Natural-language rendering:
- Let N be a natural number with N > 1.
- Let M and M1 be integers.
- Let d and d' be natural numbers.
- Assume gcd(M, N) = 1 (interpreting gcd on integers, so M is relatively prime to N).
- Assume d and d' satisfy d d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(N)).
- Assume M1 ≡ M^d (mod N).
- Conclude M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod N).

Assessment of fidelity to the original statement:
- The original statement: N is a positive integer; M is an integer coprime to N; d is an integer coprime to φ(N). If M1 ≡ M^d (mod N), then M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod N), where d' is the inverse of d modulo φ(N), i.e., d d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(N)).

Comparing with the Lean theorem:
- N positivity: The code requires 1 < N, which excludes N = 1. The original says ""positive integer"" (commonly includes 1). This is a slight specialization/strengthening; acceptable and standard in number theory contexts (modulus 1 is degenerate). No harm to the essence of the statement.
- Types of d and d': The code takes d, d' as Nat (nonnegative integers). The original says integers; but exponents are naturally taken as nonnegative. For the modular inverse condition, only residues modulo φ(N) matter, so restricting to Nat is harmless. The congruence condition (dd' ≡ 1 mod φ(N)) is explicitly assumed, which in fact implies gcd(d, φ(N)) = 1 when φ(N) > 1, and is vacuously fine when φ(N) = 1. This matches the intent that d' is an inverse of d mod φ(N).
- Coprimality assumption for M: Int.gcd M N = 1 exactly encodes M relatively prime to N.
- The hypothesis M1 ≡ M^d (mod N) and the conclusion M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod N) exactly match the claim.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem is simply stated with the correct Mathlib congruence notation on Int and totient Nat.totient N used appropriately.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the mathematical statement, with only a benign specialization (N > 1 instead of N ≥ 1) and a standard formalization choice (d, d' as Nat with explicit inverse condition). There are no illegitimate placeholders or vacuous definitions.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines are boilerplate and irrelevant to the statement.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_2d (p : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (hp1 : Odd p) : Irreducible ((x + 2) ^ p - 2 ^ p) / x in Polynomial ℤ := by sorry`
  Intended meaning in natural language: For a natural number p that is prime and odd, the polynomial ((x+2)^p − 2^p)/x is irreducible over Z[x].

2) Fidelity assessment:
- The mathematical content aimed at in the Lean statement matches the natural language assertion: irreducibility in Z[x] of the quotient polynomial ((x+2)^p − 2^p)/x for p an odd prime.
- However, the Lean formalization is not legitimate:
  - `x` is undeclared; in Mathlib the polynomial variable is usually `Polynomial.X` (or notation `X`), not `x`.
  - Division `/ x` is not a valid operation in `Polynomial ℤ` (division is not defined over integral domains that are not fields). One needs `divByMonic`, or the specific `Polynomial.divX` (which exists precisely for dividing by X when the constant term is zero), or explicitly define the quotient polynomial via coefficients.
  - The syntax `... in Polynomial ℤ` is not Lean syntax. In Lean, the ring/semiring is specified by the type of the element inside `Irreducible`, e.g., `Irreducible (somePoly : Polynomial ℤ)`.
  - Even ignoring syntactic issues, the parentheses are ambiguous: it should be `Irreducible (((x + 2) ^ p - 2 ^ p) / x)`, but again `/` is not appropriate here.
- Therefore, while the intended proposition is the same, the code does not use appropriate Mathlib notions to express the division by x or the ambient ring. This is a red flag per the guidelines: it does not constitute a legitimate, faithful translation into Mathlib terms.

3) Final check:
- Original: prove that ((x+2)^p − 2^p)/x is irreducible in Z[x] for p an odd prime.
- Lean (intended): same statement.
- Actual Lean code: uses undeclared `x`, invalid division `/` in `Polynomial ℤ`, and non-Lean syntax `in Polynomial ℤ`. Hence it fails as a faithful formal translation, despite the clearly intended match.

Given these issues, the translation is not faithful per the criteria requiring legitimate Mathlib formalization without vacuous placeholders.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_3_2 (f g : Polynomial ℚ)` introduces two polynomials f and g with rational coefficients.
- `(h : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ z : Int, (f * g).coeff n = (z : ℚ))` assumes that for every natural number n, the nth coefficient of the product polynomial f * g is an integer (viewed inside ℚ). This formalizes “the product f(x)g(x) has integer coefficients.”
- Conclusion: `∀ i j : ℕ, ∃ z : Int, (f.coeff i) * (g.coeff j) = (z : ℚ)` states that for any indices i and j, the product of the ith coefficient of f and the jth coefficient of g is an integer (again viewed in ℚ). This matches “the product of any coefficient of g(x) with any coefficient of f(x) is an integer.”
- There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions, and the statement is directly the theorem being asserted. The `sorry` is just a placeholder for the proof and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypotheses match: f and g are polynomials over ℚ; the condition that (f * g) has integer coefficients is captured by every coefficient of f * g being in the image of ℤ → ℚ.
- The conclusion matches exactly: for all coefficients of f and all coefficients of g, their product is an integer (as a rational).

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are the same. There is no change in scope, no extraneous assumptions, and no weakening/strengthening beyond standard formalization details (identifying an integer coefficient with its image in ℚ). No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.
