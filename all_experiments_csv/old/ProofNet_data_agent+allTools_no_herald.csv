1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]`: We work with a type X equipped with a metric space structure.
- `def zero_set (f : X → ℝ) : Set X := {x | f x = 0}`: Define the zero set of a function f: X → ℝ as the set of all points x in X such that f(x) = 0.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_3 {f : X → ℝ} (hf : Continuous f) : IsClosed (zero_set f) := by sorry`: The statement: if f is continuous, then the zero set of f is closed. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement defines Z(f) as the set of points where f(p) = 0 for a continuous real-valued function f on a metric space X, and asserts Z(f) is closed. The Lean code exactly mirrors this: it defines `zero_set f` as {x | f x = 0} and states `IsClosed (zero_set f)` under the hypothesis `Continuous f` with X a metric space. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary vacuous or placeholder definitions; `zero_set` is correctly defined. `Continuous` and `IsClosed` are Mathlib notions. The setting (metric space) matches the original. No extra assumptions or generalizations. The omission of the proof (`sorry`) does not affect the faithfulness of the translation per the task instructions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {k : ℕ}`: We fix a natural number k, the dimension.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_17 (x y : Fin k → ℝ) : ... := by sorry`: For vectors x and y in ℝ^k represented as functions from `Fin k` to ℝ, the statement asserts
  (∑ over i of (x i + y i)^2) + (∑ over i of (x i - y i)^2) = 2 * (∑ over i of (x i)^2) + 2 * (∑ over i of (y i)^2).
This is exactly the coordinatewise expression of the parallelogram identity for the Euclidean norm squared on ℝ^k.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement uses the Euclidean norm |·| on ℝ^k and claims |x+y|^2 + |x−y|^2 = 2|x|^2 + 2|y|^2. In ℝ^k with the standard Euclidean norm, |x|^2 = ∑ (x_i)^2. The code expresses this identity directly in coordinates via sums of squares. Thus, it is a faithful formalization of the same statement. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted (allowed per instructions).

3) Final check for differences:
- Representation: The code uses coordinate sums instead of norm notation; mathematically equivalent for ℝ^k with the Euclidean norm.
- Domain: Includes k = 0 as a degenerate case, which is a harmless slight generalization consistent with the identity.
No substantive differences affecting meaning.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem compact_metric_space_second_countable (α : Type _) [MetricSpace α] [CompactSpace α] : SecondCountableTopology α := by sorry`
  This states: For any type α equipped with a metric space structure and which is compact as a topological space, the topology on α is second countable (i.e., has a countable base). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that every compact metric space K has a countable base."" In mathlib, ""has a countable base"" is captured by the typeclass `SecondCountableTopology α`. A ""compact metric space"" corresponds to `[MetricSpace α] [CompactSpace α]`. Thus the Lean statement exactly matches the natural language claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; no vacuous placeholders are used. The theorem statement is neither a generalization nor a restriction beyond the original. It directly and faithfully encodes the statement. The use of `MetricSpace` (not pseudo-) matches the wording ""metric space."" The topology considered is the one induced by the metric, as standard in mathlib.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib, providing the necessary mathematics infrastructure.
- Comment block describes the intended statement: triangle inequality for finite sums of complex numbers.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_12 (n : ℕ) (z : Fin n → ℂ) : Complex.abs (∑ i : Fin n, z i) ≤ ∑ i : Fin n, Complex.abs (z i) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n and any n-tuple of complex numbers (encoded as a function z from the finite index type Fin n to ℂ), the absolute value of the sum of the z i is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values of the z i. Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus, and `∑ i : Fin n, ...` denotes the finite sum over i = 0, ..., n-1.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: If z1, ..., zn are complex, then |z1 + ... + zn| ≤ |z1| + ... + |zn|. The Lean statement precisely captures this, representing the list z1,...,zn as a function `z : Fin n → ℂ` and summing over `Fin n`. The use of Complex.abs matches the modulus. The structure and inequality match exactly.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Indexing: The Lean code uses indices 0..n-1 (Fin n) instead of 1..n; this is a standard equivalent formalization.
- Edge case n=0: The Lean theorem also covers n = 0, yielding 0 ≤ 0, which is a harmless slight generalization and acceptable.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an unproven body (`sorry`), which is permitted for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Real` just bring in the math library and the real-number namespace.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_7 {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h_nonneg : ∀ n, 0 ≤ a n) (h_sum : Summable a) : Summable fun n => Real.sqrt (a (n+1)) / (n+1 : ℝ)`
  translates to: Let a be a real sequence indexed by natural numbers. Assume (i) a_n ≥ 0 for all n, and (ii) the series ∑ a_n (over n ∈ ℕ) is summable. Then the series ∑ sqrt(a_{n+1})/(n+1) over n ∈ ℕ is summable. Equivalently, this is the summability of ∑_{n=1}^∞ sqrt(a_n)/n.
- The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this is acceptable per the auditing task which focuses on the statement translation, not the proof.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the convergence of ∑ a_n implies the convergence of ∑ sqrt(a_n)/n if a_n ≥ 0.""
- Indexing: The Lean statement takes sums over ℕ and expresses the second series as `sqrt(a (n+1))/(n+1)`, i.e., starts effectively at n = 1, which aligns with the usual convention avoiding division by zero. The assumption `Summable a` over ℕ (starting at 0) is a slight generalization of starting at 1, but adding/removing finitely many terms does not affect convergence, so this is fully faithful.
- Nonnegativity: The Lean code assumes `0 ≤ a n` for all n, which matches or slightly strengthens the assumption; it certainly covers the intended case.
- Target: Convergence (summability) of the series with terms sqrt(a_n)/n is exactly what is claimed.

No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The terms `Summable`, `Real.sqrt`, and the functional expression are standard Mathlib constructs. The overall translation is faithful with only the benign technical shift to ensure indexing starts at 1 in the target series.

Final check: The two problems are the same in mathematical meaning, with the Lean version being a standard precise formalization (slightly generalized indexing) of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open the namespace for sets; no mathematical content change.

  - `{α : Type*} [Preorder α]`: We are working in a type α equipped with a preorder (a reflexive, transitive ≤). This serves as an ordered set for the purposes of the statement.
  - `{E : Set α}`: E is a subset of α.
  - `(hE : ∃ x, x ∈ E)`: E is nonempty.
  - `(a b : α)`: Elements a and b in α.
  - `(ha : ∀ x ∈ E, a ≤ x)`: a is a lower bound of E.
  - `(hb : ∀ x ∈ E, x ≤ b)`: b is an upper bound of E.
  - Conclusion `a ≤ b`: The claim to prove.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: In an ordered set, for a nonempty subset E, if α is a lower bound and β is an upper bound, then α ≤ β.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes this: nonempty E, a lower bound of E, b upper bound of E, conclude a ≤ b.
- Using `Preorder` is a mild generalization (we do not need antisymmetry or totality), which is acceptable and faithful to the intended result.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only slight difference is the generality of `[Preorder α]` versus “ordered set” (often a total or partial order). Since the theorem requires only transitivity (via an element of E: a ≤ x ≤ b ⇒ a ≤ b), preorder suffices. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is precisely the intended content.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  This states: For any open set s in ℝ, there exists a countable family I of subsets of ℝ such that distinct members of I are pairwise disjoint (their intersection is empty) and the union of all sets in I equals s.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The natural language claims: Every open set in ℝ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments (i.e., disjoint intervals, usually understood to be open intervals in this context).
- The Lean statement asserts the existence of a countable pairwise disjoint cover of s by arbitrary subsets of ℝ; it does not require the elements of I to be (open) intervals/segments, nor even intervals at all.

3) Faithfulness assessment:
- The code captures countability and pairwise disjointness, and exact union equality. However, it crucially omits the requirement that each set in the family I is a (open) segment/interval. This is a central part of the theorem, not a minor technicality.
- Thus the Lean statement is strictly weaker than the intended statement: it allows any countable disjoint partition/cover, not necessarily by segments.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. To fix it, one would need to require (for example) `∀ t ∈ I, IsInterval t ∧ IsOpen t` (or more explicitly, that each t is of the form `(a,b)`, `(-∞, b)`, `(a, ∞)`, or `univ` intersected appropriately), ensuring t are open intervals.

  Natural language: For E ⊆ ℝ^k (formalized as Fin k → ℝ), define the set of condensation points P of E to be those x such that for every ε > 0, the open ball B(x, ε) contains uncountably many points of E. Here ""uncountable"" is encoded as ¬ Set.Countable.

  Natural language: If E ⊆ ℝ^k is uncountable (¬ Set.Countable E), then the set of points of E that are not condensation points (i.e., E \ P) is countable.

Step 2: Whole translation assessment.
- The definition of condensation points matches the standard/Rudin definition: every neighborhood (here, every open ball) meets E in an uncountable set. Using open metric balls in ℝ^k is equivalent to using all neighborhoods.
- The theorem states exactly that if E is uncountable, then E minus its condensation points is countable, i.e., at most countably many points of E are not in P.

Step 3: Compare with the original statement and check for discrepancies.
- Domain: ℝ^k is formalized as Fin k → ℝ, which is standard in Mathlib. No issue.
- ""Uncountable"": encoded as ¬ Set.Countable, correct.
- Condensation points: defined via all ε > 0 open balls; this is equivalent to the neighborhood formulation in metric spaces.
- Conclusion: ""at most countably many points of E are not in P"" is expressed as Set.Countable (E \ P); exact match.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the only sorry is in the proof, which is allowed per instructions since we audit the statement/translation, not the proof.

- `{f : X → Y} (hf : UniformContinuous f)` introduces a function f from X to Y with the hypothesis that f is uniformly continuous. This exactly matches the assumption ""f is a uniformly continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric space Y"".
- `{x : ℕ → X} (hx : CauchySeq x)` introduces a sequence x_n in X with the hypothesis that x is a Cauchy sequence. This matches ""for every Cauchy sequence {x_n} in X"".
- `: CauchySeq (fun n => f (x n))` states the conclusion that the sequence f(x_n) is a Cauchy sequence (in Y, since f maps into Y and Y has a metric space structure). This matches the desired conclusion.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Prove that lim_{n → ∞} sqrt(n^2 + n) − n = 1/2. The Lean statement exactly formalizes this as a statement about the limit of a sequence indexed by ℕ going to atTop, converging to 1/2 in ℝ. The coercions `(n : ℝ)` ensure the real interpretation of the terms. This is a standard and faithful formalization.

3) Final check:

- Function: sqrt(n^2 + n) − n matches exactly (with appropriate real coercions).
- Limit value: 1/2.
- No extraneous assumptions or weakened/strengthened claims.

Assume r ≠ 0 and x is not equal to any rational number (i.e., x is irrational). Then r times x is not equal to any rational number (i.e., r·x is irrational). Here `↑r` denotes the canonical coercion of r from ℚ to ℝ, and the `q` on the right side of the equality is implicitly coerced from ℚ to ℝ as well.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.

- Lean: Exactly formalizes this with r : ℚ, x : ℝ, hr : r ≠ 0, hx asserting x is not rational, concluding r·x is not rational. This is a direct and faithful translation. Using ¬ ∃ q : ℚ, x = q for irrationality is standard and equivalent. The target type is ℝ, which matches the implicit context.

- Lean: Precisely asserts existence of `E ⊆ ℝ` and a continuous function `f` defined on `E`, and the nonexistence of a continuous `g : ℝ → ℝ` that restricts to `f` on `E`.
- The use of `↥E → ℝ` and `Continuous f` captures a real-valued continuous function on the subset `E` with the subspace topology. The condition `∀ x : ↥E, g (x : ℝ) = f x` exactly states equality on all points of `E`.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. There are no extra or missing conditions, no vacuous or placeholder definitions, and the quantifiers and domains match. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_4b {X Y : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y]`: X and Y are types equipped with metric space structures.
- `{f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g)`: f and g are functions from X to Y, both continuous.
- `{E : Set X} (hE : Dense E)`: E is a subset of X which is dense in X (its closure is the whole space).
- `(h : ∀ p ∈ E, f p = g p)`: f and g agree on every point of E.
- `: ∀ x : X, f x = g x := by sorry`: conclusion: f and g agree at every point of X.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let f and g be continuous mappings from a metric space X to a metric space Y, and E a dense subset of X. If g(p) = f(p) for all p in E, then g(p) = f(p) for all p in X. (There is a small typo using P instead of E once, but the intended meaning is clear.)
- Lean: Exactly the same hypotheses and conclusion, with E dense in X, continuity of f and g, equality on E implying equality everywhere. The order of equality (f p = g p vs g p = f p) is immaterial.

No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the only content is the theorem statement with standard Mathlib notions (MetricSpace, Continuous, Dense). The statement is even slightly more generalizable in Mathlib (it would hold for Hausdorff codomain), but here it is correctly specialized to metric spaces as in the natural language.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. Minor notation difference (P vs E) is a typo in the natural language, not a substantive mismatch.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and states an exercise: In R^1 there are no two nonzero vectors that are orthogonal. The comment explains the intended translation: for real numbers x and y, if x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0 then x * y ≠ 0.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_1_18b {x y : ℝ} (hx : x ≠ 0) (hy : y ≠ 0) : x * y ≠ 0` states: For real numbers x and y, assuming x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0, then their product x*y is nonzero. This is the standard fact in a domain that the product of two nonzero elements is nonzero. In the R^1 setting with the standard inner product, the dot product of 1D vectors corresponds to ordinary multiplication of their coordinates, so this captures “no two nonzero vectors are orthogonal.”
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just a single theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder (acceptable for translation auditing as it still compiles with a warning).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “If k = 1 and x ∈ R^k, prove that there does not exist y ∈ R^k such that y ≠ 0 but x · y = 0.” Interpreted literally, this says: For any x in R^1, there is no y ≠ 0 with x·y = 0. This is false when x = 0, since 0·y = 0 for all y, including nonzero y.
- The Lean theorem proves: If x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0, then x·y ≠ 0 (encoded as x*y ≠ 0 in ℝ). This is equivalent to: For any nonzero x, there is no nonzero y with x·y = 0. Thus the Lean statement corresponds to the corrected and standard formulation: “There are no two nonzero vectors in R^1 that are orthogonal.”

3) Final check: same or different?
- Difference: The given natural language statement omits the necessary hypothesis x ≠ 0. The Lean code includes x ≠ 0 (and y ≠ 0) explicitly. Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the literal statement provided, although it is a faithful translation of the intended/corrected statement (“no two nonzero vectors in R^1 are orthogonal”).
- The use of ℝ with multiplication instead of R^1 with dot product is acceptable as a standard identification (the dot product in 1D equals ordinary multiplication), so that part is fine.

Conclusion: Almost faithful to the intended result, but not faithful to the literal natural language as written, due to the missing x ≠ 0 hypothesis in the latter.

  This states: For a metric space X and subsets A, B of X, if A and B are closed (hA, hB) and disjoint (hDis), then closure(A) ∩ B = ∅ and A ∩ closure(B) = ∅. No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted with `sorry` but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""If A and B are disjoint closed sets in some metric space X, prove that they are separated.""
- In standard topology (and in Rudin), ""separated"" means cl(A) ∩ B = ∅ and A ∩ cl(B) = ∅. The Lean theorem's conclusion is exactly these two equalities, so it directly encodes the definition of ""separated"".
- The context matches: X is a metric space, A and B are closed and disjoint.

3) Comparison and final check:
- There are no extraneous or vacuous definitions. The theorem is a direct formalization of the statement.
- The code slightly specializes to metric spaces (as in the statement) even though the result would hold in any topological space; this is acceptable.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language problem.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- The docstring states the content: Rudin exercise 3.13 about the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converging absolutely.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_3_13` is stated for a type `α` with a `NormedField` structure (so we have multiplication and a norm). We have two sequences `a b : ℕ → α`.
- Hypotheses: `ha : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)` and `hb : Summable (fun n => ‖b n‖)`, i.e., the series of norms of `a_n` and of `b_n` converge (absolute convergence of the series Σ a_n and Σ b_n).
- Conclusion: `Summable (fun n => ‖(Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k))‖)`. The inner term defines the nth Cauchy product coefficient `c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}` using `Finset.range (n + 1)` which enumerates k = 0,...,n; since k ≤ n in this range, `n - k` is genuine subtraction on ℕ. Then it asserts `Summable` of the sequence `n ↦ ‖c_n‖`, i.e., the series Σ ‖c_n‖ converges. This is precisely the statement that the Cauchy product series converges absolutely.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely.""
- Lean: Assumes absolute convergence of Σ a_n and Σ b_n (via norm-summability), defines the Cauchy product coefficients as ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}, and concludes the series Σ ‖c_n‖ is summable. This is exactly ""converges absolutely"" for the Cauchy product.

Checks for discrepancies:
- Domain generality: Lean states it for any normed field α; the natural language is typically over ℝ or ℂ. This is a harmless generalization and faithful per the guidelines.
- The Cauchy product is correctly encoded with the finite sum over k=0..n.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem body is `by sorry`, but we only assess the statement, not the proof.
- No missing conditions or off-by-one errors.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `by sorry`: proof omitted; irrelevant for translation faithfulness per instructions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: In a metric space X, with K compact and F closed, and K, F disjoint, prove there exists δ > 0 such that d(p,q) > δ for all p in K and q in F. The Lean statement exactly captures this: metric space, K compact, F closed, disjointness, and existence of a positive δ with the universal distance bound.

3) Final check:
- Assumptions match: metric space, K compact, F closed, K and F disjoint.
- Conclusion matches: existence of δ > 0 with dist p q > δ for all p in K and q in F.
- No extraneous or missing conditions. Allowing empty K or F is consistent with the natural statement and standard formulations (vacuously true); the natural statement does not require nonemptiness.
Thus, the two problems are the same.

  - This declares a theorem for a complex number `z` with the hypothesis `h: Complex.normSq z = 1`.
  - `Complex.normSq z` is the squared modulus |z|^2, and also equals z * conj z, viewed as a real number (with the ℝ-ℂ identification). Thus `h` corresponds to |z| = 1 (equivalently z⋅conj z = 1).
  - The conclusion `Complex.normSq (1 + z) + Complex.normSq (1 - z) = 4` states that |1+z|^2 + |1−z|^2 = 4.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language problem: For z with |z|=1 (equivalently z conjugate times z = 1), compute |1+z|^2 + |1−z|^2. The expected result is 4.
- The Lean theorem exactly matches this: hypothesis is |z|^2 = 1, and the statement concludes the sum of squared moduli equals 4.
- Using `Complex.normSq` is a precise formalization of |·|^2, and aligns with the equivalence to z⋅conj z = 1.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code directly states the theorem.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. There are no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the mathematical library.
- The comment explains the exercise: a continuous open map f: ℝ → ℝ is monotonic (in the usual sense: either nondecreasing or nonincreasing). It notes an equivalent Lean formalization: monotone increasing or, after composing with negation, monotone (which corresponds to monotone decreasing).
- `open Topology` just opens the Topology namespace.
- The theorem statement: Given `f : ℝ → ℝ`, `h_cont : Continuous f`, and `h_open : IsOpenMap f`, then `Monotone f ∨ Monotone (fun x => -f x)`. This says f is monotone increasing or the function x ↦ −f x is monotone increasing. Over ℝ, `Monotone (x ↦ -f x)` is equivalent to `Antitone f` (monotone decreasing), so this expresses exactly: f is monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""every continuous open mapping of R^1 into R^1 is monotonic.""
- Formal: For all `f : ℝ → ℝ` continuous and open, f is monotone increasing or decreasing (captured as `Monotone f ∨ Monotone (fun x => -f x)`). This matches the standard meaning of ""monotonic"" in this context.
- Domain and codomain are both ℝ, matching R^1 into R^1.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous assumptions are added; no missing assumptions.
- Using `Monotone (fun x => -f x)` instead of `Antitone f` is a standard equivalent formulation on ℝ.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task only asks about translation fidelity of the statement.
- The statement does not strengthen/weaken the original (e.g., it does not require strict monotonicity). It aligns with the usual nonstrict notion of monotonic.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

theorem not_linear_ordered_field_on_Complex : ¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex) := by sorry
",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The declaration `theorem not_linear_ordered_field_on_Complex : ¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex) := by sorry` states: ""There does not exist any LinearOrderedField structure on the type `Complex`."" Formally, `¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex)` means there is no way to equip the type `Complex` with the full data of a linear ordered field (operations 0, 1, +, *, ≤, etc.), regardless of whether these operations agree with the usual complex field operations.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field."" This is the classical result that there is no linear order on ℂ that is compatible with its usual field operations (i.e., no structure making ℂ, with its standard + and *, into a linearly ordered field).
- The Lean statement is strictly stronger and, in fact, not correct in this generality: `¬ Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex)` forbids any linear ordered field structure on the bare type `Complex`, even one that replaces the addition and multiplication with transported operations via a bijection `Complex ≃ ℝ`. Such a structure certainly exists by transporting the real field structure along a bijection of types, so `Nonempty (LinearOrderedField Complex)` is actually true. Thus the Lean theorem asserts something false.
- Consequently, the Lean statement does not faithfully capture the intended claim. The intended claim needs to require compatibility with the existing complex field operations. In Lean/Mathlib terms, one must assert that there is no linear order on ℂ that makes the existing field structure into a `LinearOrderedField`. The current code does not enforce that the ring/field operations in the `LinearOrderedField` structure agree with the standard ones on `Complex`.

Final comparison:
- Natural language: no order compatible with the usual complex field operations can make ℂ an ordered (linearly ordered) field.
- Lean code: no linear ordered field structure exists on the type `Complex` at all (allowing arbitrary operations), which is not only unfaithful but false.
- Therefore, the translation fails.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The theorem states: There exists a function f: ℝ → ℝ such that for every x ∈ ℝ, the limit as h → 0 of f(x + h) − f(x − h) is 0, and f is not continuous. Formally: ∃ f, (∀ x, Tendsto (h ↦ f(x+h) − f(x−h)) (nhds 0) (nhds 0)) ∧ ¬Continuous f.
- The use of Filter.Tendsto to nhds 0 correctly encodes lim_{h→0} of the expression equals 0.
- ¬Continuous (fun x => f x) is just ¬Continuous f for f: ℝ → ℝ.
- The comment suggests the example f(x) = if x = 0 then 1 else 0, which indeed satisfies the limit condition and is discontinuous.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural language says: Suppose f: ℝ → ℝ satisfies ∀x, lim_{h→0} f(x+h)−f(x−h)=0. Show that f does not need to be continuous. This is logically equivalent to exhibiting a counterexample: there exists such an f that is not continuous.
- The Lean statement is exactly the existential counterexample: ∃ f with the limit property and not continuous. So the formalization captures the intended meaning.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a proof omitted (sorry). That is acceptable per the instructions focusing on translation faithfulness.
- The exact limit notion and continuity notion are standard Mathlib definitions.
- No generalization or restriction beyond the original statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work in real numbers ℝ with sets (open Set).
- Theorem statement `Rudin_exercise_4_8a` introduces:
  - `f : ℝ → ℝ` and `E : Set ℝ`.
  - Hypothesis `huc : UniformContinuousOn f E` meaning f is uniformly continuous when restricted to E (standard Mathlib predicate).
  - Hypothesis `hE : ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ x ∈ E, abs x ≤ M` expressing that E is bounded in ℝ by a global absolute-value bound.
  - Conclusion: `∃ N : ℝ, ∀ x ∈ E, abs (f x) ≤ N`, i.e., f is bounded on E.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Let f be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set E in R^1. Prove that f is bounded on E."" This means f, defined on E ⊆ ℝ, is uniformly continuous on E; E is bounded; conclude f is bounded on E.
- Lean uses `f : ℝ → ℝ` together with `UniformContinuousOn f E`, which precisely captures uniform continuity on the subset E. It is standard and faithful to treating f as defined on all ℝ but only asserting uniform continuity on E; this is an acceptable and common formalization.
- The boundedness of E is expressed as `∃ M, ∀ x ∈ E, |x| ≤ M`, which is exactly the usual notion of boundedness in ℝ.
- The conclusion `∃ N, ∀ x ∈ E, |f x| ≤ N` is exactly that f is bounded on E.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib predicates are used.

Final check:
- The formal statement and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical meaning. The only minor formalization choice is taking f : ℝ → ℝ with a uniform continuity-on-subset predicate rather than f : E → ℝ, which is a standard and faithful representation.

Therefore, the translation is legitimate and faithful.

- The theorem declaration introduces types `X` and `Y` with instances: `[TopologicalSpace X]` and `[TopologicalSpace Y]`, a `[Preorder Y]`, and an `[OrderTopology Y]`. This says X is a topological space, and Y has a preorder equipped with the order topology (i.e., the given topology on Y is the order topology coming from the preorder).
- `{f g : X → Y}` are functions from X to Y; `(hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g)` state they are continuous.
- The goal: `IsClosed ({ x : X | f x ≤ g x })` asserts that the set of points x in X such that `f x ≤ g x` is closed in X.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but only the statement needs to match the natural language.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let Y be an ordered set in the order topology. Let f, g : X → Y be continuous. Show that the set {x | f(x) ≤ g(x)} is closed in X.”
- Lean: Y has an order (modeled as a `Preorder`) and the topology on Y is the `OrderTopology`. f and g are continuous. Concludes the set {x | f x ≤ g x} is closed. This matches the statement exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code assumes a `Preorder` on Y instead of a (possibly intended) linear order. This is a slight generalization; it does not weaken the claim and remains faithful to the spirit of “ordered set.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement.

  This states: Let g: ℝ → ℝ be differentiable everywhere (DifferentiableOn on the whole set univ). Suppose there exists a real number M with M ≥ 0 such that for every real x, the absolute value of the derivative of g at x is bounded by M, i.e., |g'(x)| ≤ M. 
- Conclusion: `∃ ε0 > 0, ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ε < ε0 → Injective (fun x => x + ε * g x)`
  There exists ε0 > 0 such that for all ε with 0 < ε < ε0, the function f(x) = x + ε g(x) is injective (one-to-one).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: g is a real function on ℝ with bounded derivative (|g'| ≤ M). Fix ε > 0 and define f(x) = x + ε g(x). Prove that f is one-to-one if ε is small enough.
- Lean formalization: Precisely captures the meaning by stating the existence of ε0 > 0 so that for all ε with 0 < ε < ε0, f is injective. It encodes bounded derivative via an explicit M and a uniform bound on |deriv g x|, and ensures differentiability everywhere via `DifferentiableOn ℝ g Set.univ`.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The code adds an explicit hypothesis `hM : 0 ≤ M`. This is harmless and consistent with |g'| ≤ M, since any bound M can be taken nonnegative. 
- The use of `DifferentiableOn ℝ g Set.univ` makes explicit that the derivative exists everywhere, which is in line with the phrase ""bounded derivative"" in the context of Rudin. 
- The quantification over ε matches the informal ""ε small enough"" by providing an ε0 and requiring 0 < ε < ε0. 
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement with meaningful, standard mathlib predicates.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_5 (a b : ℕ → ℝ)` introduces two real sequences a and b.
- The hypothesis `h` states two conditions: not (limsupa = +∞ and limsupb = -∞) and not (limsupa = -∞ and limsupb = +∞), where limsups are taken as `Filter.limsup (fun n => (a n : EReal)) atTop` and similarly for b. This is exactly the condition that the sum on the right, limsup a + limsup b, is not of the indeterminate form ∞ − ∞.
- The conclusion states `Filter.limsup (fun n => ((a n + b n) : EReal)) atTop ≤ Filter.limsup (fun n => (a n : EReal)) atTop + Filter.limsup (fun n => (b n : EReal)) atTop`, i.e., limsup of (a_n + b_n) is at most limsup a_n plus limsup b_n, all interpreted in the extended reals EReal. Casting `(a n + b n) : ℝ` to EReal is standard and equals `(a n : EReal) + (b n : EReal)` pointwise, so this matches the intended inequality.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem states precisely the desired inequality under the given proviso.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: For any real sequences {a_n}, {b_n}, limsup(a_n + b_n) ≤ limsup a_n + limsup b_n, provided the right-hand side is not of the form ∞ − ∞.
- The Lean hypothesis `h` encodes exactly the exclusion of the two cases (∞, −∞) and (−∞, ∞). The use of EReal for limsup corresponds to the extended real setting in the natural statement. The inequality matches exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: sequences in ℝ in both statements. Check.
- Notion of limsup: extended real limsup in both. Check.
- Exclusion condition: Lean code precisely excludes the two opposite-infinity cases, matching “not of the form ∞ − ∞.” Check.
- Conclusion inequality: exactly the same.
- No extraneous or missing conditions, no placeholder definitions. The proof is `sorry`, but the task is to check translation, not proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  - Conclusion: `Tendsto (fun x => f (x + 1) - f x) atTop (nhds 0)`: the function g(x) = f(x+1) − f(x) tends to 0 as x → +∞.
  - The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this is acceptable for checking translation fidelity.

2) Overall faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language states: f is defined and differentiable for every x > 0; f'(x) → 0 as x → +∞; define g(x) = f(x+1) − f(x); prove g(x) → 0 as x → +∞.
- The Lean hypotheses match: differentiable on (0, ∞) and derivative tends to 0 at +∞. The conclusion exactly matches the desired limit of g.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The Lean code takes f : ℝ → ℝ (everywhere-defined), while the natural language only requires f to be defined for x > 0. This is a harmless strengthening; the statement we prove concerns behavior as x → +∞, where x > 0 anyway.
- Derivative: Lean uses `deriv f x` and assumes its limit atTop is 0. This aligns with f' → 0 as x → +∞; values of `deriv` at x ≤ 0 are irrelevant for the atTop filter.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct formalization of the exercise.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  • Interpreted: Let f, g: 𝕜 → 𝕜 be differentiable at x with derivatives f' and g'. Assume g' ≠ 0 and f(x) = 0 = g(x). Then the limit as t → x of f(t)/g(t) exists and equals f'/g'. The mathematical expression Filter.Tendsto (fun t => f t / g t) (nhds x) (nhds (f' / g')) encodes lim_{t→x} f(t)/g(t) = f'/g'.
  • No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no placeholders. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is allowed for this auditing task as we assess the statement itself.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
The Lean statement exactly mirrors the natural language claim: If f′(x) and g′(x) exist, g′(x) ≠ 0, and f(x) = g(x) = 0, then lim_{t→x} f(t)/g(t) = f′(x)/g′(x). The formalization’s use of HasDerivAt captures derivative existence with specified derivative values; the limit is expressed via Filter.Tendsto between neighborhoods. The setting is slightly more general (any nontrivially normed field) than typical ℝ, but this is an acceptable generalization.

3) Final check (comparisons and potential discrepancies):
- Domain/codomain: Lean works over a general nontrivially normed field 𝕜 rather than just ℝ; this is a benign generalization.
- Limit notion: Uses nhds x (the usual neighborhood filter), which is standard for expressing lim_{t→x}. Although the quotient is defined at all t (including where g t = 0) in Lean via total division, the hypothesis g′ ≠ 0 and differentiability imply g has no zeros near x except possibly at x (inverse function theorem/local injectivity), so defining the function at all points does not affect the limit.
- Assumptions match exactly: f and g differentiable at x, g′(x) ≠ 0, f(x) = g(x) = 0.
There are no extraneous or missing hypotheses. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. Therefore the translation is faithful.

- `def T_infty {X : Type _} (Xset : Set X) (U : Set X) : Prop := (¬ Set.Finite (Xset \ U)) ∨ (Xset \ U = ∅) ∨ (Xset \ U = Xset)`
  This defines the predicate T_infty on subsets U of a given set Xset: U is in the collection if the complement of U in Xset is infinite, or empty, or equal to all of Xset.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_13_3b : ∃ (U1 U2 : Set ℕ), T_infty (Set.univ : Set ℕ) U1 ∧ T_infty (Set.univ : Set ℕ) U2 ∧ ¬ T_infty (Set.univ : Set ℕ) (U1 ∪ U2) := by ...`
  This states there exist subsets U1 and U2 of ℕ such that both U1 and U2 belong to T_infty for Xset = ℕ (i.e., their complements in ℕ are infinite/empty/all), but the union U1 ∪ U2 does not belong to T_infty. The comments outline a concrete choice: take A, B infinite with finite, nonempty intersection; then U1 = univ \ A, U2 = univ \ B. This makes each complement infinite, but the complement of the union is A ∩ B, which is finite and not empty or all of X, hence violates T_infty.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement asks to show that the collection T_∞ = {U | X − U is infinite or empty or all of X} need not be a topology on X. The code defines exactly that collection (in terms of set difference) and then states a theorem producing a counterexample on X = ℕ showing failure of closure under finite unions, hence it is not a topology. This matches the intent of “does not need to be a topology,” i.e., there exists some X (here ℕ) for which it is not a topology.

3) Final check for differences:
- The definition of T_infty matches the given description exactly (complement infinite, or empty, or all of X).
- The theorem uses X = ℕ in place of a general set X to provide a counterexample, which suffices to show the collection need not be a topology in general. This aligns with the natural language meaning. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the only omission is the proof (left as ‘sorry’), which does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `universe u v` and `variable {X : Type u} {ι : Sort v}`: We fix a type X and an index type ι.
- `(T : ι → TopologicalSpace X)`: We have a family of topologies on X indexed by ι, i.e., T i is a topology on X for each i.
- The theorem states: There exists a unique topology S on X such that
  (1) `∀ s : Set X, IsOpen[S] s → ∀ i, IsOpen[T i] s`. This means every S-open set is open in each T i, i.e., S ≤ T i for all i (S is contained in each T i as a collection of open sets).
  (2) `∀ S', (∀ s, IsOpen[S'] s → ∀ i, IsOpen[T i] s) → ∀ s, IsOpen[S'] s → IsOpen[S] s`. This means: for any topology S' on X, if S' ≤ T i for all i, then S' ≤ S. So S is the largest (greatest) among all topologies contained in every T i.
- `∃! (S : TopologicalSpace X), ...` asserts existence and uniqueness of such an S.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
The natural statement: Given a family of topologies T_α on X, show there is a unique largest topology on X contained in all T_α. The Lean statement asserts exactly that: existence and uniqueness of a topology S that is below every T i and is maximal with this property.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean code uses the standard order on topologies via IsOpen inclusion; this matches ""contained in all T_α"".
- The second clause encodes the ""largest"" property precisely.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib's TopologicalSpace and IsOpen directly.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]` sets up a general topological space X.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_23_6 (A C : Set X)` introduces A and C as subsets of X.
- `(hC : IsConnected C)` states that C is connected as a subspace (i.e., connected subset) of X.
- `(h1 : (C ∩ A).Nonempty)` states that C intersects A (there exists a point in both C and A).
- `(h2 : (C ∩ Aᶜ).Nonempty)` states that C intersects the complement of A (X \ A), i.e., there exists a point in both C and Aᶜ.
- Conclusion: `(C ∩ frontier A).Nonempty` states that C intersects the frontier (boundary) of A.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let A ⊂ X. Show that if C is a connected subspace of X that intersects both A and X − A, then C intersects Bd A.”
- In Lean, `IsConnected C` is the standard way to encode “C is a connected subspace (subset) of X.”
- `Aᶜ` is the complement of A in X, matching “X − A.”
- `frontier A` is Mathlib’s name for the boundary of A (Bd A), so this matches the conclusion precisely.
- The premise “A ⊂ X” simply means A is a subset of X; in Lean this is implicit by typing `A : Set X`, so no extra hypothesis is needed.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly and faithfully matches the natural language claim. There are no discrepancies in scope or generality (allowing A to be any subset of X, not necessarily proper, is consistent with the original statement).

Final check: The two statements are the same. No differences found.

- `def interval : Type := { x : ℝ // x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 }`
  This defines the type `interval` as the closed interval [0,1] viewed as a subtype of ℝ, i.e., the set of real numbers x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
- `def f (n : ℕ) (x : interval) : ℝ := x.val ^ n`
  This defines the sequence of functions f_n: [0,1] → ℝ by f_n(x) = (x)^n (using `x.val` to extract the real number from the subtype element).
- `theorem not_uniform_convergence : ¬ ∃ (g : interval → ℝ), ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : interval, abs (f n x - g x) ≤ ε := by sorry`
  This states: It is not the case that there exists a function g: [0,1] → ℝ such that for every ε > 0, there exists N with the property that for all n ≥ N and for all x ∈ [0,1], |f_n(x) − g(x)| ≤ ε. That is, the sequence (f_n) does not converge uniformly (to any function) on [0,1].

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to define f_n(x) = x^n on [0,1] and show that (f_n) does not converge uniformly. The code faithfully defines the domain as [0,1], the functions f_n(x) = x^n, and states the negation of the uniform convergence criterion (nonexistence of any uniform limit function g). Using ≤ ε instead of < ε is a standard equivalent variant and does not change the meaning.

3) Final comparison:
- Domain: [0,1] vs `Icc 0 1` (subtype) — same.
- Function: f_n(x) = x^n — same.
- Claim: does not converge uniformly — expressed as ¬∃ g such that the uniform convergence condition holds — same meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all auxiliary definitions are legitimate.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- Hypothesis `hmap : ∀ x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, f x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1` states that f maps points in [0,1] back into [0,1], i.e., f([0,1]) ⊆ [0,1].
- Conclusion `∃ x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, f x = x` asserts there exists a point x in [0,1] with f x = x, i.e., a fixed point in the interval.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: if X = [0,1] and f : X → X is continuous, then f has a fixed point. The Lean version models this by taking f : ℝ → ℝ, assuming continuity on [0,1] (ContinuousOn on Icc 0 1) and that f maps [0,1] into [0,1]. This is a standard and faithful formalization of a continuous self-map on the subspace [0,1]. The conclusion matches the existence of a fixed point in [0,1].

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain: Natural statement uses f : [0,1] → [0,1] continuous. Lean uses f : ℝ → ℝ, continuous on [0,1] and mapping [0,1] into itself. These are equivalent formulations (continuous on the subspace with image in the subspace). No extra or missing assumptions beyond that rephrasing.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the statement is a standard formalization.
Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_18_13 {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`:
  X and Y are topological spaces, and Y is Hausdorff.
- `{A : Set X} {f g1 g2 : X → Y}`:
  A is a subset of X. We consider functions f, g1, g2 from X to Y (we will restrict them to appropriate domains using `ContinuousOn`).
- `(hf : ContinuousOn f A)`:
  f is continuous on A. This models “f: A → Y is continuous” (continuity in the subspace topology is equivalent to `ContinuousOn f A`).
- `(hg1 : ContinuousOn g1 (closure A)) (hg2 : ContinuousOn g2 (closure A))`:
  g1 and g2 are continuous on the closure of A. This matches the requirement that the extensions be continuous on \bar A.
- `(h1 : ∀ x ∈ A, g1 x = f x) (h2 : ∀ x ∈ A, g2 x = f x)`:
  On A, g1 and g2 agree with f; i.e., they extend f from A.
- Conclusion: `∀ x ∈ closure A, g1 x = g2 x`:
  g1 and g2 agree on closure A. This is the uniqueness claim for the extension.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Let A ⊆ X; f: A → Y continuous; Y Hausdorff. If f extends to a continuous g: \bar A → Y, then g is uniquely determined by f.
- Lean formalization: If g1 and g2 are continuous on closure A and both extend f on A, then g1 = g2 on closure A. This is the standard equivalent formulation of uniqueness of the extension.
- Representational choices: The code models functions on A and \bar A as functions X → Y together with `ContinuousOn` over the relevant subsets and equalities on A. This is a standard and faithful way in Mathlib to avoid subtypes. The assumption `hf` (that f is continuous on A) matches the original hypothesis. While uniqueness per se does not need `hf` (it follows from g’s continuity anyway), including it aligns with the original assumptions and does not weaken or distort the statement.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement precisely captures the uniqueness: any two continuous extensions on \bar A agreeing with f on A must coincide on \bar A. The small difference of using global functions with `ContinuousOn` rather than subtype domains is routine and equivalent. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions (`ContinuousOn`, `closure`, `T2Space`) are from Mathlib.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] {ι : Type _}`: We work in a topological space X, with ι an index type for a family of sets.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_23_3 (A : Set X) (Aα : ι → Set X)`: We are given a subset A of X and a family of subsets Aα indexed by ι.
- `(hA : IsConnected A)`: A is connected (as a subset of X, with the subspace topology implicit in mathlib's IsConnected on sets).
- `(hAα : ∀ i, IsConnected (Aα i))`: Each Aα i is connected.
- `(hnon : ∀ i, (A ∩ Aα i).Nonempty)`: For every i, A ∩ Aα i ≠ ∅ (Nonempty is the standard formalization of nonempty intersection).
- `IsConnected (A ∪ ⋃ i, Aα i)`: The conclusion states that the union A ∪ (⋃ Aα) is connected.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let {A_α} be a collection of connected subspaces of X; let A be a connected subset of X. If A ∩ A_α ≠ ∅ for all α, then A ∪(⋃ A_α) is connected.
Lean formalization exactly encodes: a topological space X; a family of connected subsets Aα; a connected set A; nonempty intersection A ∩ Aα for all α; then the union A ∪ (⋃ Aα) is connected.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The use of `IsConnected` on `Set X` matches “connected subspaces/subsets.”
- The condition `(A ∩ Aα i).Nonempty` matches “A ∩ A_α ≠ ∅.”
- The conclusion exactly matches “A ∪(⋃ A_α) is connected.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with omitted proof, which is acceptable per the task.
No mismatches or changes in quantification or generality. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : X → Y)` introduces topological spaces X and Y and a function p: X → Y.
- The theorem `perfect_map.compact_of_target_compact` takes hypotheses:
  - `hp_cont : Continuous p` meaning p is continuous.
  - `hp_closed : IsClosedMap p` meaning p is a closed map.
  - `hp_surj : Function.Surjective p` meaning p is surjective.
  - `hp_fib : ∀ y, IsCompact (p ⁻¹' {y})` meaning each fiber p^{-1}({y}) is compact.
  - `hY : IsCompact (univ : Set Y)` meaning Y is compact.
  And concludes `IsCompact (univ : Set X)`, i.e., X is compact.

2) Whole translation assessment:
This exactly states: given a closed, continuous, surjective map with compact fibers (i.e., a perfect map, as described in the comment), if Y is compact then X is compact. The Lean statement is a direct formalization using standard Mathlib predicates (Continuous, IsClosedMap, Surjective, IsCompact). The conclusion matches the natural language claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language defines a perfect map as closed, continuous, surjective, with compact fibers. The code does not define a separate PerfectMap but assumes these properties explicitly, which is faithful.
- Compactness is expressed as `IsCompact univ` for Y and for X, which is the standard formal expression. No other discrepancies.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the task instructions focusing on statement faithfulness.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_16_1 {X : Type*} (t : TopologicalSpace X) {Y A : Set X} (h : A ⊆ Y) : ...` introduces a type `X` with a specified topology `t`, subsets `Y` and `A` of `X`, and an assumption `h` that `A` is contained in `Y`.
- Left-hand side: `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : Subtype A => (⟨(a : X), h a.property⟩ : Subtype Y)) (TopologicalSpace.induced (fun y : Subtype Y => (y : X)) t)`
  • `(TopologicalSpace.induced (fun y : Subtype Y => (y : X)) t)` is the subspace topology on `Subtype Y` induced from `X` via the inclusion `Subtype Y → X`.
  • `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : Subtype A => (⟨(a : X), h a.property⟩ : Subtype Y)) (...)` then induces a topology on `Subtype A` via the inclusion `Subtype A → Subtype Y` (which is well-defined by `h`). This is exactly “the topology A inherits as a subspace of Y,” where Y itself carries the subspace topology from X.
- Right-hand side: `TopologicalSpace.induced (fun a : Subtype A => (a : X)) t` is the subspace topology on `Subtype A` induced directly from `X` via the inclusion `Subtype A → X`. This is “the topology A inherits as a subspace of X.”
- The statement asserts equality of these two topologies, i.e., subspace-of-subspace equals subspace from the ambient space.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: if Y is a subspace of X and A is a subset of Y, then the topology A inherits as a subspace of Y equals the topology it inherits as a subspace of X. The Lean code models Y as a subspace of X by explicitly using the induced topology on `Subtype Y` from `X`. It models A as a subset of Y by taking `A : Set X` together with `h : A ⊆ Y`, and then compares the induced topologies described. This exactly captures the intended statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- ""Y is a subspace of X"" is encoded by using `TopologicalSpace.induced (Subtype Y → X) t` on the left. This matches the statement.
- ""A is a subset of Y"" is encoded by `A : Set X` with `h : A ⊆ Y`. This is the standard formalization and equivalent to taking `A` as a subset of `Y`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The equality of topologies is precisely the standard transitivity property of subspace topologies.
There are no discrepancies.

  This states that the family of subsets U of ℝ × ℝ which are exactly products of open intervals (a, b) × (c, d) with a, b, c, d rational and satisfying a < b and c < d, forms a topological basis for ℝ × ℝ (with its standard topology). Here `Set.Ioo (a : ℝ) (b : ℝ)` denotes the open interval (a, b) in ℝ, and `Set.prod` forms the Cartesian product. The rationals are coerced into reals. The `sorry` is a placeholder for the proof, which is acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that the set of rectangles (a, b) × (c, d) with rational endpoints (and a < b, c < d) is a basis for ℝ². The Lean statement precisely asserts that this collection is a topological basis for ℝ × ℝ, which is ℝ².
- The use of `Ioo` matches open intervals (a, b). The parameters are rationals, as required, coerced to reals.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language also describes the collection as ""countable."" The Lean statement does not explicitly assert countability, but it does select exactly that collection (determined by rational endpoints). Since the claim to be proved is that this collection is a basis, and the code asserts exactly that, the omission of an explicit ""countable"" predicate does not change the main statement. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only the proof is omitted via `sorry`.
- Therefore, the formal statement faithfully matches the mathematical content of the original statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_ex_3_21 {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X] (E : ℕ → Set X)` introduces a complete metric space X and a sequence (indexed by ℕ) of subsets E n of X.
- `hclosed : ∀ n, IsClosed (E n)` means each E n is closed.
- `hnonempty : ∀ n, (E n).Nonempty` means each E n is nonempty.
- `hmono : ∀ n, E n ⊇ E (n+1)` means the sequence is nested decreasing: E n ⊇ E_{n+1}.
- `hdiam : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x y, x ∈ E n → y ∈ E n → dist x y ≤ ε` is an epsilon-formulation of “diam(E n) → 0”: for every ε>0, eventually all pairwise distances of points in E n are ≤ ε.
- Conclusion: `∃! x, (⋂ n, E n) = {x}` says there exists exactly one x such that the intersection of all E n equals the singleton {x}; equivalently, the intersection consists of exactly one point.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Space: complete metric space X — matches.
- Sequence: closed, nonempty sets — matches via `hclosed`, `hnonempty`.
- Nested: E_n ⊇ E_{n+1} — matches via `hmono`.
- Diameter condition: lim diam(E_n) = 0 — represented by `hdiam`, which is a standard equivalent formulation of diameter tending to 0 (eventual uniform smallness of pairwise distances in E n).
- Conclusion: the intersection consists of exactly one point — matches via `∃! x, ⋂ E_n = {x}`.

3) Differences / potential discrepancies:
- The natural language statement explicitly assumes each E_n is bounded. The Lean code does not include a separate boundedness assumption. However, the `hdiam` condition (eventual uniform smallness of pairwise distances) implies that for sufficiently large n, E n is bounded and that diam(E n) → 0 in the usual sense. In the classical presentation, the boundedness assumption is there to ensure diameters are finite; here, the code sidesteps this by using the ε-characterization directly. This is a slight generalization (it allows possibly unbounded early E n), but it does not weaken the essential hypothesis that diameters go to 0.
- Indexing starts at ℕ (0-based) instead of from 1; this is a harmless reindexing.

4) Auxiliary definitions / placeholders:
- There are no auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions. The theorem statement is precise and standard. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is only about the faithfulness of the statement.

Overall, the Lean statement faithfully captures the mathematical content. The only deviation is omitting an explicit boundedness hypothesis; given the stronger epsilon-diameter condition, this is a benign and standard generalization. Hence it merits a high score, slightly below perfect for the minor mismatch.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code works in a topological setting: X and Y are types with TopologicalSpace structures.
- It defines is_quotient_map (p : X → Y) to mean: p is continuous, p is surjective, and for every subset U of Y, U is open in Y if and only if its preimage p ⁻¹' U is open in X. This is a standard, faithful definition of a quotient map (including continuity explicitly; though redundant, it is consistent with standard usage).
- The theorem Munkres_exercise_22_2a states: Given maps p : X → Y and f : Y → X, with hp : Continuous p, hf : Continuous f, and hcomp : p ∘ f = id (the identity on Y), then is_quotient_map p holds. This expresses exactly that a continuous map p with a continuous right inverse is a quotient map.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let p : X → Y be continuous. If there is a continuous f : Y → X with p ∘ f = id_Y, then p is a quotient map.
- Lean theorem assumes p and f are continuous and p ∘ f = id, and concludes p is a quotient map (as defined). This matches precisely.
- The definition of quotient map in the code includes continuity of p as part of the property, while the statement assumes continuity of p separately. This is consistent and not a discrepancy; the combined content is equivalent to the standard definition (surjective and U open iff preimage is open), and with hp, the “iff” immediately implies continuity anyway.
- There are no vacuous placeholders: is_quotient_map is a meaningful, faithful definition; the theorem proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed under the audit rules because we only check translation of the statement.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No differences impacting faithfulness.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Set: using Mathlib and set notation.
- The theorem Rudin_exercise_5_17 states: For a function f : ℝ → ℝ, assume
  • h : ContDiffOn ℝ 3 f (Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1): f is C^3 (three times continuously differentiable) on the closed interval [-1, 1].
  • h_neg1 : f (-1) = 0
  • h_0 : f 0 = 0
  • h_1 : f 1 = 1
  • h'0 : deriv f 0 = 0: the (usual) derivative of f at 0 equals 0.
  Conclusion: ∃ x : ℝ, x ∈ Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1 ∧ deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≥ 3. Here Ioo (-1) 1 is the open interval (-1, 1), and deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x denotes the third derivative f^{(3)}(x).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: f is real, three times differentiable on [-1,1]; f(-1)=0, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f'(0)=0; prove there exists x in (-1,1) with f^{(3)}(x) ≥ 3.
- The Lean hypotheses match the value conditions and the derivative condition at 0. The function is ℝ → ℝ (a standard harmless extension of the domain beyond [-1,1]). The regularity assumption is stated as ContDiffOn ℝ 3 on [-1,1], which is a slightly stronger assumption than merely “three times differentiable” (it requires continuous derivatives up to order 3). This is a mild strengthening and acceptable per the guidelines as a slight specialization that still faithfully captures the intended statement.
- The conclusion exactly matches: existence of x ∈ (-1,1) with the third derivative at x ≥ 3, expressed as deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≥ 3.
- Potential subtlety: deriv returns 0 if f is not differentiable, but here ContDiffOn on Icc ensures differentiability (indeed C^3) at interior points, so the third derivative is well-defined at any x ∈ (-1,1). Also, since 0 is an interior point, ContDiffOn implies differentiability at 0 in the usual sense, so h'0 expresses f'(0) = 0 as intended.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (ContDiffOn, deriv, Icc/Ioo).

Final comparison:
- Content matches the natural statement up to the benign strengthening of smoothness (C^3 vs just thrice differentiable). The quantified variables, interval, values, derivative condition, and the existential conclusion are all faithful.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

This is exactly the restriction q : A → p(A), considered as a map between subspace topologies, and the predicate is that this function is open.

2) Whole translation assessment:
- The formal statement matches the natural language: it assumes p is an open map and A is open in X, and then claims the restricted map q : A → p(A) is an open map (in the subspace topologies). The function is correctly defined using subtypes and the image subset p '' A.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts (`IsOpenMap`, `Subtype`, `Set.image`) are standard Mathlib.

3) Final check for differences:

- Lean: Exactly this, with the precise formalization using subtypes and the image subset `p '' A` as the codomain. The open-ness refers to the subspace topology, which is the intended interpretation of ""p(A)"" in topology texts.
- No mismatches or hidden weakenings/strengthenings. The extra hypothesis `hA` is appropriate and used conceptually (though the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable here per the task since we audit the statement, not the proof).

  In words: The topology on `X` generated from the subcollection `A` equals the infimum (greatest lower bound) in the lattice of topologies on `X` of the set of all topologies `t` such that every `U ∈ A` is open in `t`. Since the infimum of a family of topologies is their intersection (as sets of open sets), this states: the topology generated by `A` is the intersection of all topologies containing `A` (i.e., in which each `U ∈ A` is open).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Show that if 𝒜 is a subbasis for a topology on X, then the topology generated by 𝒜 equals the intersection of all topologies on X that contain 𝒜.”
- Lean: Shows exactly that the topology `generateFrom A` is the intersection of all topologies containing `A` (making every `U ∈ A` open). This is the standard characterization of the topology generated by a subbasis.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean statement actually holds for any `A` (not necessarily a subbasis), which is a slight generalization of the natural language statement that assumes `A` is a subbasis. This generalization is harmless and faithful to the intended meaning. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; it uses standard Mathlib notions (`TopologicalSpace.generateFrom`, `sInf`, and `IsOpen`). The set being intersected is exactly the set of topologies containing `A` in the sense that all members of `A` are open.

- Definition `is_quotient_map (p : X → Y) : Prop := Function.Surjective p ∧ (∀ U : Set Y, IsOpen U ↔ IsOpen (p ⁻¹' U))`:
  This defines a quotient map as a surjective map p such that for every subset U of Y, U is open in Y if and only if the preimage p⁻¹ U is open in X. This is a standard (and equivalent) definition of a quotient map.
- The theorem `munkres_exercise_23_11 (p : X → Y) (hq : is_quotient_map p) (hfib : ∀ y : Y, IsConnected (p ⁻¹' {y})) (hY : ConnectedSpace Y) : ConnectedSpace X := by sorry` states: Given a map p : X → Y which is a quotient map (as defined), if every fiber p⁻¹({y}) is connected (here IsConnected is the Mathlib predicate on subsets), and Y is connected as a space (ConnectedSpace Y), then X is connected as a space (ConnectedSpace X). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement is clear and precise.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Let p: X → Y be a quotient map. Show that if each set p^{-1}({y}) is connected, and if Y is connected, then X is connected.”
- The Lean definition of `is_quotient_map` is a legitimate, standard definition of quotient map (surjective and open-set-lifting equivalence). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.
- The hypothesis `hfib : ∀ y : Y, IsConnected (p ⁻¹' {y})` exactly matches “each set p^{-1}({y}) is connected.”
- The hypothesis `hY : ConnectedSpace Y` matches “Y is connected.”
- The conclusion `ConnectedSpace X` matches “X is connected.”
- No extraneous assumptions are introduced, and no critical assumptions are omitted. Using ConnectedSpace for whole-space connectedness and IsConnected for subset connectedness aligns with Mathlib conventions.

Final check: The formal statement is equivalent to the natural language statement. There are no discrepancies. The auxiliary definition `is_quotient_map` is non-vacuous and faithful. Therefore, the translation passes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, so all standard topology notions (TopologicalSpace, T2Space) are the real ones.
- The docstring states: If the product Π X_i is Hausdorff (T2) and each X_i is nonempty, then each factor X_i is Hausdorff. This matches the natural language statement.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_32_2a {ι : Type _} {X : ι → Type _} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]`: We fix an index type ι and a family of types X : ι → Type with a topological space structure on each X i.
- `(h_nonempty : ∀ i, Nonempty (X i)) :`: Assumption that each factor X i is nonempty.
- `T2Space (∀ i, X i) → ∀ i, T2Space (X i) := by sorry`: If the dependent product Π i, X i (i.e., the product space) is Hausdorff, then for every i, the space X i is Hausdorff. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation checking.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Natural language: ""Show that if ∏ X_α is Hausdorff, then so is X_α. Assume that each X_α is nonempty."" The Lean statement precisely encodes: given nonemptiness of each factor and Hausdorffness of the product Π i, X i, conclude Hausdorffness of each factor. It uses Mathlib's `T2Space` to mean Hausdorff and the dependent function type `∀ i, X i` for the product topology, which is standard in Mathlib. The nonemptiness assumption is included exactly as stated.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are genuine Mathlib concepts.
- No extra unintended constraints; the only extra hypothesis is the nonemptiness, which the natural language explicitly assumes.
- The conclusion matches exactly: product Hausdorff ⇒ each factor Hausdorff.
- Minor note: Mathematically, the nonemptiness assumption is not necessary for this implication, but since the natural language includes it, the code faithfully mirrors that assumption.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

  This declares a theorem: For any type F with a field structure, any type V with an additive commutative group structure and an F-module structure (i.e., a vector space over F), and any elements a : F and v : V, if a • v = 0 (zero of V), then a = 0 in F or v = 0 in V. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Prove that if a ∈ F, v ∈ V, and av = 0, then a = 0 or v = 0. Here, F is a field and V is a vector space over F. The Lean statement exactly matches this: F is a field (`[Field F]`), V is a module over F (`[Module F V]`) with the usual additive group structure (`[AddCommGroup V]`), and the conclusion is `a = 0 ∨ v = 0` given `a • v = 0`.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The Lean code is not introducing extraneous assumptions nor weakening the claim. Using `Module F V` over a `Field F` is exactly the formalization of a vector space over a field. The statement matches the original exactly.

The proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: ""Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular."" The Lean theorem precisely asserts that for any topological space X, if it has instances `LocallyCompactSpace X` and `T2Space X` (Hausdorff), then it has an instance `CompletelyRegularSpace X`. This is exactly the same claim in Mathlib's terminology.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib typeclasses. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check for differences:
- No discrepancy in hypotheses: ""locally compact Hausdorff"" matches `[LocallyCompactSpace X] [T2Space X]`.
- No discrepancy in conclusion: ""completely regular"" matches `CompletelyRegularSpace X`.
- Potential definitional subtlety: Some sources define ""completely regular"" to include T1; Mathlib’s `CompletelyRegularSpace` is the standard notion of complete regularity, and since we assume Hausdorff (T2) already, this aligns with the intended theorem. There is no mismatch with the given natural language statement.

  This defines the collection of subsets of ℝ that are exactly open intervals (q1, q2) with rational endpoints q1, q2 ∈ ℚ and q1 < q2. The coercions `↑q1`, `↑q2` embed rationals into reals; `Ioo a b` is the open interval (a,b).

  This asserts that the topology generated from that collection equals the standard topology on ℝ. `generateFrom` is the coarsest topology containing the given collection.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show that the collection {(a,b) | a < b, a and b rational} is a basis that generates the standard topology on ℝ. The Lean code precisely defines that collection as a set of subsets of ℝ (open intervals with rational endpoints), then states two theorems: (i) it is a topological basis for the usual topology, and (ii) the topology it generates equals the standard topology. This matches the statement exactly.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The collection is correctly modeled as open intervals Ioo with rational endpoints and strict inequality.
- The basis property is asserted relative to the standard topology on ℝ.
- The generation of the standard topology is explicitly stated.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- `def U : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 = 0 } ∪ { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = 0 }` defines U as the union of the y-axis (points with first coordinate 0) and the x-axis (points with second coordinate 0) in ℝ^2, modeled as ℝ × ℝ.
- The theorem `Axler_exercise_1_7` states three things about this U:
  1) `Set.Nonempty U`: U is nonempty.
  2) `(∀ (a : ℝ) (v : ℝ × ℝ), v ∈ U → a • v ∈ U)`: U is closed under scalar multiplication by real numbers.
  3) `¬ (∀ (x y : ℝ × ℝ), x ∈ U → y ∈ U → x + y ∈ U)`: U is not closed under addition (i.e., there exist x,y in U such that x + y ∉ U).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language asks for an example of a nonempty subset U of ℝ^2 that is closed under scalar multiplication but is not a subspace. The code picks a specific U (union of the coordinate axes) and states exactly that U is nonempty, closed under scalar multiplication, and not closed under addition. Not being closed under addition implies U is not a subspace. This matches the request for an example with the required properties.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The two problems are the same: provide an example with the stated properties. Representing ℝ^2 as ℝ × ℝ is standard. Showing failure of closure under addition suffices to conclude “not a subspace.” No extraneous or vacuous definitions are present; `U` is a legitimate subset. The proof is omitted (via `sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement/translation.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language request by defining a correct example and stating the required properties.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `inductive Three : Type | a | b | c` defines a three-element type X = {a, b, c}.
- `def is_topology (X : Type) (T : Set (Set X)) : Prop := ...` defines what it means for T to be a topology on X: it contains ∅ and univ, is closed under binary intersections, and closed under arbitrary unions. This is the standard definition and is non-vacuous.
- `def X := Three` fixes the underlying set to be the three-point type.
- `def A : Set X := {a}`, `def AB : Set X := {a, b}`, `def C : Set X := {c}`, `def BC : Set X := {b, c}` define specific subsets of X.
- `def T1 : Set (Set X) := {∅, A, AB, (univ : Set X)}` and `def T2 : Set (Set X) := {∅, C, BC, (univ : Set X)}` define two collections of subsets of X. These are intended to be topologies: T1 is {∅, {a}, {a,b}, X} and T2 is {∅, {c}, {b,c}, X}, which do satisfy the topology axioms.
- The theorem statement `∃ T1' T2' : Set (Set X), is_topology X T1' ∧ is_topology X T2' ∧ ¬ is_topology X (T1' ∪ T2')` asserts the existence of two topologies on X whose union is not a topology. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but the statement is clear and matches the intended example (indeed, the union {∅, {a}, {c}, {a,b}, {b,c}, X} fails closure under finite intersections since {a,b} ∩ {b,c} = {b} is not included).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Given a family of topologies on X, the union need not be a topology. To demonstrate this, it suffices to provide a counterexample with a finite family (e.g., two topologies). The Lean theorem does exactly this: it asserts that there exist two topologies on a concrete set X such that their union is not a topology.
- Using a concrete X = {a,b,c} is a slight specialization, acceptable for a counterexample-based statement. The predicate `is_topology` correctly captures the concept of a topology.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; all auxiliary definitions are legitimate and meaningful. The extra definitions `T1` and `T2` are consistent with the theorem’s intended witnesses, though not explicitly tied in the statement (which is fine—existence is what's claimed).

Final check:
- The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization: it presents the existence of (a finite family of) topologies on X whose union is not a topology. This exactly matches the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib's topology and order theory library.
- theorem order_topology_regular {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α] [Preorder α] [OrderTopology α] : RegularSpace α := by sorry
  Natural language: For any type α equipped with a preorder and a topology that is the order topology (in the Mathlib sense), the space α is a regular space.

2) Whole statement faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: ""Show that every order topology is regular."" The Lean statement asserts that for any α with a preorder and whose topology is an OrderTopology, α is a RegularSpace. This is precisely the formalization of the claim. Mathlib’s OrderTopology is indeed the class asserting the topology on α is the order topology coming from the preorder. RegularSpace is the standard Mathlib class for regularity.

3) Final check / differences:
- Scope: The Lean version assumes a Preorder, which is a slight generalization beyond linear orders. This is acceptable and faithful as it still states the intended property for all order topologies in Mathlib’s generality.
- Regular vs T3: In Mathlib, RegularSpace does not automatically include T1; the natural language statement typically just says ""regular"" without specifying T1, so this matches the usual meaning. No mismatch is introduced by the absence of T1 in the statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem signature is given, with no placeholders redefining concepts. The use of `sorry` is for the proof and does not affect the faithfulness of the translation.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful (slightly more general) formalization of the natural language claim.

  `(∃ S : Submodule R V, (S : Set V) = (U : Set V) ∪ (W : Set V))` is logically equivalent to `U ≤ W ∨ W ≤ U`.
  Interpreting the left side: there exists a submodule S whose underlying set equals the union of the underlying sets of U and W. This expresses that the union U ∪ W is itself a submodule (since it equals the underlying set of some submodule). The right side says that one of the submodules is contained in the other.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the union of two subspaces of V is a subspace of V if and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.”

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard library, including metric spaces, isometries, compactness, and homeomorphisms.
- Docstring: States the definition of an isometry (distance-preserving map) and the claim: if f is an isometry on a compact space X, then f is bijective and hence a homeomorphism. This aligns with the natural language statement.
- `theorem isometry_on_compact_bijective {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompactSpace X] (f : X → X) (hf : Isometry f) : Function.Bijective f := by sorry`
  Translation: Let X be a compact metric space. If f : X → X is an isometry, then f is bijective. This matches the first major conclusion to show.
- `def isometry_on_compact_homeomorph {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompactSpace X] (f : X → X) (hf : Isometry f) : X ≃ₜ X := by sorry`
  Translation: Under the same hypotheses, there exists a homeomorphism structure on f, i.e., one can produce a homeomorphism X ≃ₜ X from f. This encodes the “hence a homeomorphism” part.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language first defines an isometry via the equation d(fx, fy) = d(x, y). In Mathlib, `Isometry f` is exactly this definition for metric spaces, so using `hf : Isometry f` is faithful to the definition.
- The first Lean theorem asserts that an isometry on a compact metric space is bijective, which directly matches the claim.
- The second Lean definition constructs a homeomorphism from such an isometry on a compact space, aligning with “hence a homeomorphism.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib ones. The use of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task since we only judge the translation, not the proof.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Domains and codomains match: f : X → X.
- Hypotheses match: X is a metric space and compact; f is an isometry.
- Conclusions match: bijectivity and homeomorphism.
- The code does not restate the definitional equivalence of isometry with the distance condition, but it uses the standard `Isometry` predicate which is exactly that definition. This is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement without introducing placeholders or altering meaning.

The Lean statement captures exactly this: a product `Π i, X i` is normal implies each `X i` is normal, under the assumption that each `X i` is nonempty. The use of `(∀ i, X i)` in Lean denotes the Π-type (product), and `NormalSpace` is the Mathlib notion of a normal topological space. The nonemptiness assumption is present as `ne : ∀ i, Nonempty (X i)`. The conclusion is for an arbitrary `i : ι`, `NormalSpace (X i)`, which corresponds to “then so is each X_α”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical content matches exactly: same hypotheses (product normal + each factor nonempty) and same conclusion (each factor normal). There are no extraneous assumptions or weakenings/strengthenings. The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language and assess.
- variable (α : Type _) [TopologicalSpace α]: We work with a topological space X = α.

- def countably_compact_space : Prop := ∀ (U : ℕ → Set α), (∀ n, IsOpen (U n)) → (∀ x, ∃ n, x ∈ U n) → ∃ N : Finset ℕ, ∀ x, ∃ n ∈ N, x ∈ U n
  Translation: For every countable family (U_n) of open sets that covers X (i.e., every point x lies in some U_n), there exists a finite set of indices N such that the subfamily {U_n | n ∈ N} still covers X. This is exactly the standard definition of countable compactness.

- def is_limit_point (x : α) (s : Set α) : Prop := ∀ U : Set α, IsOpen U → x ∈ U → ∃ y ∈ s, y ≠ x ∧ y ∈ U
  Translation: x is a limit (accumulation) point of s if every open neighborhood U of x contains a point y of s distinct from x. This is the standard definition of a limit point.

- def limit_point_compact_space : Prop := ∀ s : Set α, s.Infinite → ∃ x, is_limit_point α x s
  Translation: Every infinite subset of X has a limit point in X. This is the usual definition of limit point compactness.

- def t1_space_prop : Prop := ∀ x y : α, x ≠ y → ∃ U : Set α, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∉ U
  Translation: For any two distinct points x ≠ y, there is an open set U containing x but not y. This is a standard equivalent condition for T1 spaces.

- theorem countably_compact_iff_limit_point_compact_of_t1 (h : t1_space_prop α) : (countably_compact_space α ↔ limit_point_compact_space α) := by sorry
  Translation: Assuming X is T1, countable compactness of X is equivalent to limit point compactness of X. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement matches the target claim.

Step 2: Compare the whole to the original statement.
Original: Define countably compact as every countable open cover has a finite subcover. Show that in a T1 space, countable compactness is equivalent to limit point compactness (every infinite subset has a limit point).

The code introduces precise, non-vacuous definitions for all notions and states exactly the equivalence under a T1 hypothesis. It uses one of the standard characterizations of T1, which is fine. No placeholders like True or none are used. The quantifications and formulations (countable index by ℕ, finite subcover via Finset, limit point via neighborhoods) are faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing countable covers by ℕ is standard and equivalent to “countable.”
- The definition of limit point allows the point to be in or outside the subset, as is standard.
- The T1 condition used is an equivalent characterization.
There are no discrepancies that change the meaning. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {α : ℕ → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (α i)]` introduces a countable family (indexed by ℕ) of topological spaces α i, with the product topology on the Pi type `(∀ i, α i)` implicitly available.
- The theorem `countable_product_of_countable_dense_has_countable_dense` takes:
  - `D : ∀ i, Set (α i)`: for each i, a specified subset D i of α i,
  - `hcount : ∀ i, (D i).Countable`: each D i is countable,
  - `hdense : ∀ i, Dense (D i)`: each D i is dense in α i.
  It concludes: there exists a subset `S : Set (∀ i, α i)` of the countable product such that `S` is countable and dense in the product.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: “If X is a countable product of spaces having countable dense subsets, then X has a countable dense subset.” The Lean code formalizes a product indexed by ℕ (a countable index set) and assumes each factor has a countable dense subset (given explicitly as D i). The conclusion asserts existence of a countable dense subset in the product. This captures the intended theorem.

3) Final check and differences:
- Indexing: The code uses ℕ as the countable index set, a standard specialization of “countable product,” which is acceptable.
- Hypotheses: The code assumes a chosen family `D i` with the properties rather than merely their existence. This is a harmless strengthening typical in formalizations and equivalent given choice; it does not change the mathematical content of the result.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib's `Dense` and `Countable` as intended.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Axler_exercise_6_3 {n : ℕ} (a b : Fin n → ℝ) :` declares a theorem for any natural number n, with two real-valued sequences indexed by `Fin n` (i.e., indices 0,1,...,n-1).
- The statement `(∑ i : Fin n, a i * b i) ^ 2 ≤ (∑ i : Fin n, (((i : ℕ) : ℝ) + 1) * (a i) ^ 2) * (∑ i : Fin n, (b i) ^ 2 / (((i : ℕ) : ℝ) + 1))` says: the square of the sum of products a_i b_i over i in Fin n is less than or equal to the product of two sums: the first sum is over i of ((i+1) times (a_i)^2); the second sum is over i of ((b_i)^2 divided by (i+1)). Here `((i : ℕ) : ℝ) + 1` is the real number i+1, ensuring the weights are 1,2,...,n.
- `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; we are auditing the statement only.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language inequality is: for real numbers a_1,...,a_n and b_1,...,b_n, (∑_{j=1}^n a_j b_j)^2 ≤ (∑_{j=1}^n j a_j^2)(∑_{j=1}^n b_j^2/j).
- The Lean version indexes by `i : Fin n` (i = 0,...,n-1) but uses the weight `(i : ℕ)+1`, so the weights are 1,...,n. Identifying a_i with a_{i+1} and b_i with b_{i+1}, the Lean statement is exactly the same inequality.
- Types are ℝ as required. The sums and the squaring of the entire sum on the left match the original. The denominators `(i+1)` avoid division by zero, matching the original indexing starting at 1.
- Edge case n = 0 is harmless in both settings (empty sums give 0), so no mismatch there.

3) Final check of differences:
- The only difference is the indexing convention (0-based in Lean with a shift of +1 in the weights), which is a standard and faithful reindexing of the original 1-based statement. No other discrepancies.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly formalizes the inequality.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `variable {G : Type*} [TopologicalSpace G] [Group G] [IsTopologicalGroup G]`: We fix a type G with a topology and a group structure, and assume G is a topological group.
- `def C : Set G := connectedComponent (1 : G)`: Define C to be the connected component of G that contains the identity element 1.
- `lemma connected_component_one_is_normal_subgroup : ... := by sorry`: The lemma asserts the following four properties of C:
  - `(1 : G) ∈ C`: the identity belongs to C.
  - `∀ x y, x ∈ C → y ∈ C → x * y ∈ C`: C is closed under multiplication.
  - `∀ x, x ∈ C → x⁻¹ ∈ C`: C is closed under taking inverses.
  - `∀ g, (fun x => g * x * g⁻¹) '' C = C`: for every g, the conjugation map x ↦ g x g⁻¹ sends C onto C (i.e., the image equals C). This states invariance under conjugation, i.e., normality.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to show that the component containing the identity in a topological group is a normal subgroup. The code defines C as the connected component of 1 and then states exactly the subgroup axioms (contains 1, closed under multiplication and inverses) and normality (conjugation invariance). While it does not package C as a `Subgroup`, the listed properties are precisely those that make C a normal subgroup. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- ""Component containing the identity"" is formalized as `connectedComponent (1 : G)`, which is the standard notion of connected component in mathlib and matches the usual meaning of component in topology.
- ""C is a normal subgroup"" is captured by the subgroup axioms plus conjugation invariance of C. The equality of the conjugation image with C is even slightly stronger than the usual inclusion formulation and is equivalent for subgroups. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; `connectedComponent` is standard in mathlib. The extra structure `[IsTopologicalGroup G]` matches the topological group hypothesis.
No discrepancies found.

Natural language translation of lemma:
Given a topological space X that is T3 (regular T1 in Mathlib’s terminology), for any two distinct points x ≠ y in X, there exist open sets U and V with x ∈ U and y ∈ V such that the closures of U and V are disjoint (their intersection is empty).

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
Original: ""Show that if X is regular, every pair of points of X have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint.""
- The code assumes [T3Space X], which in Mathlib typically means T1 + regular. Many texts (including Munkres) use ""regular"" to mean T1 + regular (T3), so this matches the common convention. Even if one defines ""regular"" without T1, the conclusion about separating two points by neighborhoods with disjoint closures usually requires T1 (so the Lean assumption is appropriate and not weaker).
- The code explicitly requires x ≠ y. The natural language statement implicitly needs this, since identical points cannot have disjoint closures of neighborhoods containing them. So the Lean version clarifies a necessary condition rather than changing the claim.
- The conclusion in Lean exactly states: there exist open neighborhoods of x and y whose closures are disjoint.

Step 3: Final check (same or different?).
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the lemma is a direct statement.
- The only differences are standard formal clarifications: explicit distinctness and using T3Space for ""regular"". These align with the intended meaning of the natural language statement, especially in the context of Munkres exercise 31.1.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This declares a theorem asserting: for all integers x and y, the equality 3·x^2 + 2 = y^2 does not hold (i.e., is false). The `sorry` is a placeholder for a proof and does not affect the statement.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language claim ""Show that the equation 3 x^2 + 2 = y^2 has no solution in integers"" is equivalent to saying there do not exist integers x and y such that 3 x^2 + 2 = y^2. In logic, this is equivalent to ∀ x y ∈ ℤ, 3 x^2 + 2 ≠ y^2. The theorem statement precisely encodes this universal negation over Int.

3) Final check: comparison and differences:
- Domain: Integers for both variables — matches the statement.
- Expression: 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2 — matches exactly.
- Quantifiers/negation: ""no solution"" ↔ ∀ x y, ... ≠ ... — matches.

The natural language statement says: If S, T ∈ L(V), then ST and TS have the same eigenvalues. The Lean theorem states for all c, c is an eigenvalue of ST iff c is an eigenvalue of TS. This is exactly the set equality of eigenvalues. The formulation uses the explicit existential definition of eigenvalue and the composition operators `(S.comp T)` and `(T.comp S)`, matching ST and TS.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- The Lean code assumes V is finite-dimensional. The natural statement (from Axler) is in the finite-dimensional context, so this is consistent. Even if the natural statement did not explicitly say finite-dimensional, this is a standard, harmless specialization and aligns with Axler's setting.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; everything is standard Mathlib.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- Comment: States the Munkres exercise about showing R × R with the dictionary (lexicographic) order topology is metrizable.
- `instance Munkres_exercise_20_2 : MetricSpace (Lex (Real × Real)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: We assert that the type `Lex (ℝ × ℝ)` (the underlying set ℝ × ℝ endowed with the lexicographic order via the `Lex` type synonym) has a `MetricSpace` structure. That is, we are providing a specific metric that induces its topology (indeed, a `MetricSpace` instance supplies a topology).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement is: “Show that ℝ × ℝ in the dictionary (lexicographic) order topology is metrizable.” This means: For the topological space whose topology is the order topology induced by the lexicographic order on ℝ × ℝ, there exists a metric that induces that very topology. In Mathlib terms, the appropriate assertion is that this topological space is `MetrizableSpace` (existence of a compatible metric), while retaining its intended topology (the order topology from the lexicographic order).
- The Lean code instead declares an instance `MetricSpace (Lex (ℝ × ℝ))`. This sets the topology on `Lex (ℝ × ℝ)` to be the metric topology coming from the provided metric. It does not assert or relate this topology to the dictionary/order topology. In particular, it neither assumes nor ensures that the topology on `Lex (ℝ × ℝ)` is the order topology; it simply installs a metric topology, which could be arbitrary (e.g., even the discrete metric). Thus, it does not capture the requirement that the metric generate the lexicographic order topology.
- Moreover, if Mathlib already provides an order topology instance for `Lex (ℝ × ℝ)`, then declaring a `MetricSpace` instance without proving compatibility with that topology is the wrong notion. The correct formalization would be to provide an instance/proof of `MetrizableSpace (Lex (ℝ × ℝ))` under the order topology (or prove that the metric-induced topology equals the order topology).

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Original: existence of a metric whose induced topology equals the dictionary-order (order) topology on ℝ × ℝ.
- Code: existence of a metric structure (hence a metric topology) on the type `Lex (ℝ × ℝ)`, with no linkage to the dictionary order topology.
- Difference: The code does not assert the metric is compatible with the dictionary order topology; it just installs some metric topology. Hence the translation is not faithful.

No auxiliary definitions are present; the only issue is the mismatch between “metrizable” (there exists a compatible metric for a given topology) and “MetricSpace” (chooses a specific metric/topology, ignoring the intended one). Therefore, it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: “Show that ∑' 1/n, the sum being over square free integers, diverges.” This means the series formed by summing 1/n over all squarefree positive integers n diverges.
- The Lean code sums over k ∈ ℕ with n = k+1, and only includes the terms where n is squarefree, setting other terms to 0. This is a standard way in Lean to encode a subseries over a subset of ℕ. Using `¬ Summable` for a series of nonnegative real terms correctly expresses divergence.
- Including n = 1 (since `Squarefree 1` holds) is consistent with the usual convention; even if there were any ambiguity, adding finitely many terms does not affect divergence.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts (`Summable`, `Squarefree`) are from Mathlib.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem and the natural language statement are the same mathematically: both assert that the series ∑ over squarefree n of 1/n diverges.
- No discrepancies found; indexing by k with n = k+1 is a faithful technical encoding.

Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_1_30 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :` introduces a natural number n with the hypothesis that n ≥ 2, and states a theorem about it.
- `¬ ∃ m : ℤ, ... = (m : ℚ)` asserts that there does not exist an integer m such that the given sum equals m when viewed as a rational number. This formalizes “the sum is not an integer.”
- `Finset.sum (filter (fun k => 2 ≤ k) (range (n + 1))) (fun k => (1 : ℚ) / (k : ℚ))` constructs the sum over k in {0,1,...,n} filtered to those with k ≥ 2, i.e., k = 2,3,...,n, of the terms 1/k in ℚ. Thus this is exactly 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n in ℚ.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The code precisely states that for any natural n with n ≥ 2, the harmonic partial sum from 1/2 to 1/n is not an integer, by ruling out equality with any integer cast to ℚ. This matches the natural language statement.
- The use of ℚ to express integrality (via equality to an integer cast to ℚ) is standard and faithful.
- The indexing via `range (n+1)` and filtering `2 ≤ k` correctly picks 2,3,...,n. No off-by-one issues.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement (with an admitted proof), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Final check:
- Natural language: “Prove that 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n is not an integer.” Implicitly for n ≥ 2.
- Lean: For all n with 2 ≤ n, 1/2 + ... + 1/n ≠ any integer (in ℚ). These are the same mathematical statement; the Lean version explicitly states the necessary bound n ≥ 2. No discrepancies.

- `open Real`: Open the Real namespace for notations/constants like `π`, `sin`.
- `lemma sin_pi_div_12_is_algebraic : IsAlgebraic ℚ (sin (π / 12) : ℝ) := by sorry`: States the lemma that the real number `sin(π/12)` is algebraic over the rationals, i.e., it satisfies some nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: “Show that sin(π/12) is an algebraic number.” In standard mathematics, “algebraic number” means algebraic over ℚ. The Lean statement is exactly `IsAlgebraic ℚ (sin (π / 12) : ℝ)`, which formalizes that the real number `sin(π/12)` is algebraic over ℚ. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The only slight difference is that Lean explicitly specifies the base field ℚ and the ambient type ℝ, which is the standard precise formalization of the informal claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {V : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup V] [InnerProductSpace ℂ V] [FiniteDimensional ℂ V]`:
  This sets up V as a finite-dimensional complex inner-product space (hence a complex Hilbert space in finite dimension). The `NormedAddCommGroup` instance follows from the inner product; including it explicitly is harmless.

- `theorem axler_exercise_7_11 (T : V →ₗ[ℂ] V) (h : T.comp (LinearMap.adjoint T) = (LinearMap.adjoint T).comp T) : ∃ S : V →ₗ[ℂ] V, S.comp S = T := by sorry`:
  This states: Let T be a complex-linear operator on V. Assume T is normal, expressed as T composed with its adjoint equals its adjoint composed with T, i.e., T ∘ T† = T† ∘ T. Then there exists a complex-linear operator S on V such that S ∘ S = T, i.e., S^2 = T. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for the purpose of checking translation faithfulness.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Suppose V is a complex inner-product space. Prove that every normal operator on V has a square root."" In symbols: if T is normal (T commutes with its adjoint), then there exists S with S^2 = T.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes: for any T: V →ₗ[ℂ] V with T normal (via the adjoint commutation), there exists S with S ∘ S = T. This matches the notion of square root.

Comparison and potential differences:
- The Lean code assumes V is finite-dimensional, whereas the natural language statement did not explicitly state finite-dimensional. In the context of Axler and the theorem name ""axler_exercise_7_11"", the exercise is indeed for finite-dimensional complex inner-product spaces. This is a slight specialization that is standard and faithful to the intended result.
- All other aspects (normality via T adjoint commuting, existence of S with S^2 = T, linear operators on V) match perfectly.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization (with the standard finite-dimensional assumption) of the natural language statement.

  - Conclusion: `∃ U : Submodule K V, (U ⊓ LinearMap.ker T) = ⊥ ∧ LinearMap.range T = Submodule.map T U`.
    - This states there exists a subspace U of V such that its intersection with `ker T` is `{0}` (in Lean, intersection of submodules is `⊓` and `{0}` is `⊥`), and the range of T equals the image of U under T (in Lean, `{T u | u ∈ U}` is represented by `Submodule.map T U`).

  - finite dimensional V: `[FiniteDimensional K V]`.
  - T linear: `T : V →ₗ[K] W`.
  - U subspace: `U : Submodule K V`.
  - `U ∩ ker T = {0}`: `(U ⊓ ker T) = ⊥`.
  - `range T = {Tu | u ∈ U}`: `LinearMap.range T = Submodule.map T U` (map is the image submodule `{w | ∃ u ∈ U, T u = w}`).
- The only mild difference is the generality: the code allows K to be a division ring, while the natural language implicitly assumes a field (vector spaces). This is a slight generalization and is acceptable per the guidelines.

3) Final check for differences:
- No mismatch in mathematical meaning:
  - Intersection vs infimum: matches intersection.
  - `{0}` vs `⊥`: matches the trivial subspace.
  - Image set `{Tu | u ∈ U}` vs `Submodule.map T U`: matches the image subspace.
  - Range T is `LinearMap.range T`: matches the range subspace.
- Slight generalization (division ring instead of field) is fine and standard; it does not weaken or change the intended statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement without proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a standard one) of the natural language statement, with a harmless generalization to division rings.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_5_28 (p : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (hmod : p % 4 = 1) :` declares a theorem about a natural number p, assumed prime (`hp`) and congruent to 1 modulo 4 (`hmod`). This matches the natural language condition “for p ≡ 1 (mod 4)” and implicitly that p is a prime.
- `(∃ x : ZMod p, x ^ 4 = (2 : ZMod p))` states that there exists an element x in the ring of integers modulo p such that x^4 equals 2 in ZMod p. This is exactly the formalization of “x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution”.
- `↔ ∃ A B : ℤ, (p : ℤ) = A ^ 2 + 64 * B ^ 2` states that this is equivalent to the existence of integers A, B such that p (viewed as an integer) equals A^2 + 64 B^2. This matches “p is of the form A^2 + 64 B^2”.
- There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; the only objects used are standard Mathlib notions (ZMod, Prime, integer squares), and the proof is omitted with `sorry` (allowed for this auditing task).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: “Show that x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution for p ≡ 1 (mod 4) iff p is of the form A^2 + 64 B^2.”
- The Lean statement precisely encodes this: for a prime p with p % 4 = 1, the existence of a solution to x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) is equivalent to p being representable as A^2 + 64 B^2 with A, B integers.
- Using equality in ZMod p is a standard and faithful encoding of congruences modulo p. Allowing A, B to be integers matches the usual formulation.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Prime assumption: The natural statement is standardly about primes p ≡ 1 (mod 4). The Lean code explicitly assumes p is prime, which aligns with the intended context of the exercise.
- Modulo condition: `p % 4 = 1` is equivalent to `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)` for natural numbers, so this is faithful.
- Quantification over ZMod p vs integers: Existence of x in ZMod p with x^4 = 2 is equivalent to the modular congruence having an integer solution. This is faithful.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem compact_hausdorff.union_of_two_closed_metrizable_is_second_countable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]`:
  X is a type with a topology, and X is compact and Hausdorff. So X is a compact Hausdorff space.
- `(X1 X2 : Set X)`:
  We are given two subsets X1 and X2 of X (to be viewed as subspaces via the subtype).
- `(hcover : X1 ∪ X2 = (univ : Set X))`:
  X1 and X2 cover X, i.e., X = X1 ∪ X2.
- `(h1_closed : IsClosed (X1 : Set X)) (h2_closed : IsClosed (X2 : Set X))`:
  X1 and X2 are closed subsets of X.
- `(h1_sc : SecondCountableTopology (Subtype X1)) (h2_sc : SecondCountableTopology (Subtype X2))`:
  The subspace topologies on X1 and on X2 are second countable.
- Conclusion: `: SecondCountableTopology X`:
  X is second countable.
- The proof is omitted with `sorry` (which is acceptable for translation auditing as we focus on the statement, not the proof).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
Original statement: If X is compact Hausdorff and X = X1 ∪ X2 with X1, X2 closed and metrizable, then X is metrizable.

The Lean theorem replaces:
- Hypotheses on pieces: “X1 and X2 are metrizable” by “X1 and X2 are second countable”. Under the given context, X1 and X2 are closed in a compact Hausdorff X, hence each of X1 and X2 is compact Hausdorff. In compact Hausdorff spaces, being metrizable is equivalent to being second countable. Therefore, the hypothesis used in the Lean code is equivalent to the natural language hypothesis.
- Conclusion: “X is metrizable” by “X is second countable”. Again, since X is compact Hausdorff, these two properties are equivalent. The comment in the code explicitly notes this equivalence and explains the intent to prove second countability as a sufficient (indeed equivalent) target.

Thus, both the assumptions and the conclusion are replaced by equivalent properties in the compact Hausdorff setting, making the formalized statement faithful to the original.

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- Coverage of X by closed subspaces: matches exactly (`hcover`, `h1_closed`, `h2_closed`).
- Compact Hausdorff assumptions on X: present (`[CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]`).
- Hypotheses on X1, X2: metrizable vs second countable—equivalent here because X1, X2 are compact Hausdorff (as closed subspaces of compact Hausdorff X).
- Conclusion: metrizable vs second countable—equivalent for compact Hausdorff X.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no cheating via bogus definitions; only a theorem statement with omitted proof.

Therefore, the Lean statement is an accurate, legitimate translation (indeed equivalent formulation) of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `X` and `Y` are types with `MetricSpace` structures; `Y` is complete (`[CompleteSpace Y]`). `A : Set X`. `f : X → Y` with hypothesis `hf : UniformContinuousOn f A` (this models a function defined on `A` being uniformly continuous via restriction).
- Goal: There exists a function `g : X → Y` such that:
  • `ContinuousOn g (closure A)` — g is continuous when restricted to `closure A`.
  • `∀ x, x ∈ A → g x = f x` — g agrees with f on A (so g extends f to `closure A`).
  • `UniformContinuousOn g (closure A)` — g is uniformly continuous on `closure A`.
  • Uniqueness clause: For any `g1 g2 : X → Y`, if both are continuous on `closure A`, agree with f on `A`, and are uniformly continuous on `closure A`, then `g1 = g2` on `closure A`.

Assessment vs. the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Given metric spaces X, Y with Y complete, and A ⊆ X, a uniformly continuous map f: A → Y extends uniquely to a continuous map g: \bar A → Y, and g is uniformly continuous.
- Modeling choices:
  • Lean uses `f : X → Y` with `UniformContinuousOn f A` to encode a function defined on A; this is standard and faithful.
  • Lean takes `g : X → Y` with properties only on `closure A` and agrees with f on A; this is equivalent to defining `g : closure A → Y` with continuity and uniform continuity (subspace topology/uniformity). This is faithful.
- Existence and properties: The code asserts existence of such a g with continuity on `closure A` and uniform continuity on `closure A`, and that g extends f on A. This matches the existence and the “g is uniformly continuous” parts of the natural statement.
- Uniqueness: Here is the key discrepancy. The natural statement says g is the unique continuous extension (i.e., uniqueness among all continuous extensions). The Lean theorem states uniqueness only among extensions that are both continuous on `closure A` and uniformly continuous on `closure A`. This is a strictly stronger hypothesis for the competitors `g1, g2`, so the uniqueness conclusion is weaker than in the natural statement. The true uniqueness does not require assuming uniform continuity for the alternative extension(s). Thus the code does not fully capture the intended uniqueness.

Final comparison:
- Same: metric spaces, completeness of Y; f uniformly continuous on A; existence of an extension to closure A that is continuous and uniformly continuous; agreement with f on A.
- Difference: Uniqueness in the code is restricted to uniformly continuous extensions, whereas the natural statement requires uniqueness among continuous extensions (no uniform continuity assumption needed). This is a minor but real mismatch.

Verdict: Near-faithful, but not exact due to the overly strong hypothesis in the uniqueness clause.

  Hypotheses: n is a natural number, n is not prime, and n ≠ 4.
  Conclusion: n divides (n−1)! (with `n - 1` as natural-number subtraction, so for n ≥ 1 this is the usual (n−1)!, and for n = 0 it is 0!).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The mathematical content “(n−1)! ≡ 0 (mod n)” is equivalent to “n ∣ (n−1)!,” so using divisibility is fine and faithful.
- The exception `n ≠ 4` is correctly represented as a hypothesis.
- However, the natural-language statement about congruence mod n implicitly requires n ≥ 1 (modulus positive). The Lean statement has no such restriction and quantifies over all `n : Nat` with only `¬ Nat.Prime n` and `n ≠ 4`. This allows n = 0, for which the conclusion `0 ∣ (0 - 1)! = 0! = 1` is false, and moreover “≡ (mod 0)” is not even defined in the original statement. Thus, the Lean statement is a problematic overgeneralization including an invalid case.
- For n = 1, the Lean statement is true (1 ∣ 0! = 1), and the natural language would also be fine since modulo 1 is well-defined; but the main issue remains n = 0.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Aside from the missing positivity condition (e.g., `0 < n` or `n ≥ 1`), everything matches: nonprime hypothesis, exception n = 4, and the target divisibility equivalent to the stated congruence. The missing restriction leads to an actual counterexample (n = 0) in Lean’s domain, so the formal statement is not fully faithful to the intended natural language statement.

Conclusion: Nearly faithful, but missing the essential restriction `0 < n` (or `n ≥ 1`).

Line-by-line translation:
- `open Complex` just opens the complex namespace.
- `variable {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℂ E] [FiniteDimensional ℂ E]` sets up a complex inner-product space E, assumed finite-dimensional (to ensure the adjoint of a linear map exists as a linear map), with the usual normed additive group structure.
- `theorem axler_exercise_7_9 (A : E →ₗ[ℂ] E) (h_normal : A.comp A.adjoint = A.adjoint.comp A) : (A = A.adjoint) ↔ (∀ (μ : ℂ), (∃ v : E, v ≠ 0 ∧ A v = μ • v) → μ.im = 0) := by sorry`
  - A is a ℂ-linear endomorphism on E.
  - `h_normal` asserts A is normal: A ∘ A† = A† ∘ A, where `A.adjoint` is the (finite-dimensional) adjoint linear map with respect to the inner product.
  - The conclusion is an equivalence: A is self-adjoint (A = A†) if and only if for every complex number μ, if there exists a nonzero vector v with Av = μ v (i.e., μ is an eigenvalue), then the imaginary part of μ is zero (i.e., μ is real).

Assessment of fidelity:
- The natural language statement: ""A normal operator on a complex inner-product space is self-adjoint iff all its eigenvalues are real.""
- The Lean statement assumes A is normal via `h_normal` and then states `(A = A.adjoint) ↔ (∀ μ, (∃ v ≠ 0, Av = μ v) → μ.im = 0)`, which exactly encodes ""A is self-adjoint iff all eigenvalues are real.""
- The setting is a complex inner-product space; the code specifies this. The code restricts to finite-dimensional E to ensure the adjoint exists as a linear map; this is a standard and acceptable specialization (and matches Axler's finite-dimensional context). This is a slight specialization, not a change of meaning.
- The eigenvalue condition is correctly formalized via the existence of a nonzero eigenvector; the ""real"" condition is rendered as `μ.im = 0`, which is equivalent to μ being real as a complex number.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the only hypothesis is normality, and the statement is an equivalence conditioned on that hypothesis, matching the phrasing ""a normal operator ... is self-adjoint iff ..."".

Final check:
- Both problems are the same up to the benign specialization to finite dimension. There are no discrepancies in the mathematical meaning. The theorem codifies exactly the intended equivalence under the normality assumption on a complex inner-product space.

- The natural language asks to prove that the power series ∑ z^n/n converges at every point on the unit circle except z = 1.
- The Lean statement asserts summability of ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^(n+1)/(n+1), which is exactly the same series as ∑_{k=1}^∞ z^k/k after an index shift (k = n+1). The hypotheses |z| = 1 and z ≠ 1 match “on the unit circle except z = 1.” The conclusion “Summable …” corresponds to convergence.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The indexing shift is a standard equivalence; the mathematical meaning is unchanged.
- The statement does not claim divergence at z = 1, which is not required by the natural language problem (it only asserts convergence for all other points).

Therefore, the Lean code’s theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the Mathlib library.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_2_4 (a : Int) (n m : Nat) (hnm : n > m) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
    Int.gcd (a^(2^n) + 1) (a^(2^m) + 1) = if (a % 2 = 0) then 2 else 1 := by
    sorry`
  Natural language: For any integer a and natural numbers n, m with n > m and a ≠ 0, the greatest common divisor of a^(2^n) + 1 and a^(2^m) + 1 equals 2 if a is even (i.e., a % 2 = 0), and equals 1 otherwise (i.e., when a is odd). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
  Technical notes: `Int.gcd` takes integer inputs and returns a natural number. The expressions `a^(2^n)` (with exponent a natural number) are well-typed. The parity test is implemented as `a % 2 = 0`, which correctly captures evenness for integers in Lean.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""If a is a nonzero integer, then for n > m show that (a^{2^{n}}+1, a^{2^{m}}+1) = 1 or 2 depending on whether a is odd or even.""
- Lean: Exactly encodes that the gcd equals 2 if a is even, else 1, under the assumptions that a ≠ 0 and n > m, with n, m as natural numbers. This matches the intended meaning precisely.
- The use of `a % 2 = 0` corresponds to ""a is even""; the else case corresponds to ""a is odd"". The gcd is returned as a natural number, which is standard.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification and assumptions (a nonzero integer; n, m natural with n > m) match.
- Conclusion matches exactly: gcd equals 2 if a is even, otherwise 1.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is a direct formalization. The omitted proof is acceptable per the instructions, as we assess translation rather than proof.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Proof omitted.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that [0,1]^ω is not locally compact in the uniform topology.” Typically, this refers to the uniform topology of uniform convergence on ω (e.g., induced by the sup metric on sequences), which is strictly finer than the product topology. Under the product topology, [0,1]^ω is compact (Tychonoff), hence locally compact, so the point of the statement is that the uniform (sup) topology is different and not locally compact.
- The Lean statement introduces an arbitrary UniformSpace instance [UniformSpace (∀ n, Icc01 n)] and concludes ¬ LocallyCompactSpace for the induced topology. This is too general and not faithful to “the” uniform topology. In fact, there are UniformSpace structures on this type for which the space is locally compact (e.g., the discrete uniformity, which yields a discrete, hence locally compact, topology). Moreover, the canonical instance on a Pi type in Mathlib is the product uniformity, which induces the product topology; in that topology, [0,1]^ω is compact and therefore locally compact, contradicting the claimed conclusion. Thus the theorem, as stated, is actually false for the default instance and grossly misstates the intended topology.
- The code does not specify the intended uniform (sup) topology. In Mathlib, one would typically use UniformFun/UniformOnFun (uniform convergence) or a specific metric/uniformity definition that yields the sup uniformity on sequences, not the default Pi uniformity. As written, the theorem quantifies over any UniformSpace structure, which is far stronger than the natural language statement and incorrect.

Auxiliary definitions:
- The only auxiliary definition Icc01 is legitimate and faithful to [0,1]. No vacuous placeholders.

Conclusion:
- The Lean statement is not a faithful translation: it does not fix the intended uniform topology and instead asserts non-local compactness for any uniform structure on the product, which is false for standard and discrete instances. Therefore the translation fails.

1. Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_4_4 (p : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (hmod4 : p % 4 = 1) (a : ZMod p) :` sets up a natural number p with the hypothesis that p is prime and p ≡ 1 (mod 4), and an element a of ZMod p (integers modulo p).
- `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1) ↔ IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) (p - 1)` states that a is a primitive (p−1)-st root of unity in ZMod p if and only if −a is also a primitive (p−1)-st root of unity. In the context of ZMod p with p prime, this is equivalent to saying a has multiplicative order p−1 in (ZMod p)× if and only if −a does; i.e., a is a primitive root modulo p iff −a is.

2. Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: “Consider a prime p of the form 4t + 1. Show that a is a primitive root modulo p iff −a is a primitive root modulo p.”
- The Lean code captures “p of the form 4t+1” as `p % 4 = 1`. It places a in ZMod p and uses `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` which in this setting expresses that a is a primitive root modulo p (i.e., has multiplicative order p−1). The equivalence with `-a` matches exactly the claim.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; there’s only the theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per instructions.

3. Final check for differences:
- The code and the statement match in all essential details: prime p, p ≡ 1 mod 4, element a modulo p, and equivalence of being a primitive root for a and −a. The formalization uses standard Mathlib predicates (`IsPrimitiveRoot`) in the appropriate structure (ZMod p). There are no discrepancies or undue generalizations/specializations.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_1_13b (Ω : Set ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (c : ℝ)` introduces an open set Ω in ℂ, a function f: ℂ → ℂ, and a real constant c.
- `(hopen : IsOpen Ω)` states that Ω is open.
- `(hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω)` states that f is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on Ω.
- `(h : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (Complex.im (f z)) = c)` says that the imaginary part of f is constant on Ω, equal to c.
- Conclusion: `∃ a : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = a` states that there exists a complex number a such that f is identically equal to a on Ω (i.e., f is constant on Ω).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose that f is holomorphic in an open set Ω. Prove that if Im(f) is constant, then f is constant.”
- The Lean hypotheses mirror this exactly: Ω is open, f is holomorphic on Ω (captured by `DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω`), and Im(f) is constant on Ω (modeled by a chosen constant `c` with `∀ z ∈ Ω, im (f z) = c`).
- The conclusion in Lean precisely states that f is constant on Ω.

Final check and potential nuances:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; there’s a single theorem statement with standard Mathlib predicates.
- Using `DifferentiableOn ℂ` for holomorphic is standard in Mathlib for functions ℂ → ℂ.
- The introduction of the explicit constant `c : ℝ` is equivalent to saying “Im(f) is constant,” since that means there exists such a c.
- Note: Some textbook versions of this result assume Ω is connected to avoid the case of different constants on different components; both the natural language statement and the Lean code omit connectedness and thus assert the same (stronger) claim. Therefore, regardless of mathematical correctness in full generality, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the provided natural language.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the given statement.

  Natural language: For a real parameter a with a > 0, the (unqualified) integral over ℝ of the function x ↦ (x sin x)/(x^2 + a^2) equals π e^(−a). In Lean, `∫ x : ℝ, ...` denotes the Lebesgue (Bochner) integral over the whole real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement uses the improper integral ∫_{−∞}^{∞}.
- The Lean code asserts an equality for the Lebesgue integral over ℝ. For this integrand, (x sin x)/(x^2 + a^2) ~ sin x / x as |x| → ∞, so it is only conditionally convergent as an improper integral and is not absolutely integrable. Hence it is not Lebesgue integrable over ℝ (∫ |f| = ∞).
- In Mathlib, `∫ f` is the Lebesgue integral, which is defined and equals 0 when `f` is not integrable (there is a lemma `integral_undef`). Thus the Lean statement is not equivalent to the improper integral statement and in fact would be false as written.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation. A faithful formalization should use an improper integral formulation, e.g., a limit of interval integrals `Tendsto (fun R => ∫ x in -R..R, f x) atTop (𝓝 (π * Real.exp (-a)))`, or a principal value if that is the intended meaning.

3) Final comparison:
- Same integrand, same parameter condition a > 0, same target value π e^(−a).
- Crucial mismatch: Lebesgue integral in Lean vs improper integral in the problem statement. Since the function is not Lebesgue integrable, the Lean statement does not match the intended mathematics.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the integral notion mismatch.

  This states: For any natural number n and natural number p such that p = 2^(2^n) + 1 and p is prime, the element 3 in ZMod p is a primitive (p − 1)-th root of unity, i.e., 3 is a primitive root modulo p. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib’s standard `ZMod` and `IsPrimitiveRoot`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If p = 2^n + 1 is a Fermat prime, show that 3 is a primitive root modulo p.""
- In standard terminology, a Fermat prime is a prime of the form 2^(2^k) + 1. The code matches this by explicitly assuming p = 2^(2^n)+1 and p.Prime. The conclusion ""IsPrimitiveRoot (3 : ZMod p) (p - 1)"" is the standard formalization of ""3 is a primitive root modulo p"" for a prime p.

3) Final comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The natural language statement writes p = 2^n + 1 but also says ""is a Fermat prime""; by definition, Fermat primes are of the form 2^(2^k) + 1. The code uses the correct Fermat form explicitly. This is consistent with the intended meaning and is not a vacuous or misleading change; it is a faithful formalization of ""p is a Fermat prime."" No extraneous or missing conditions beyond primality and the Fermat form.
- No auxiliary placeholders or fake definitions are used; the statement is a direct, faithful rendering in Mathlib terms.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement, with the minor notational mismatch clarified by the explicit Fermat form in the code.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code works over a field K and a K-vector space V, with V finite-dimensional: `[Field K] [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] [FiniteDimensional K V]`.
- It also includes `[SMul K (V →ₗ[K] V)]`, which is the standard scalar multiplication of linear endomorphisms by scalars; this is a redundant but harmless typeclass assumption since it already exists in Mathlib.
- `T : V →ₗ[K] V` is a linear operator on V.
- Hypothesis `h`: For every nonzero linear functional `φ : V →ₗ[K] K`, we have `Submodule.map T (LinearMap.ker φ) ≤ LinearMap.ker φ`. In words: For every nonzero functional φ, the kernel of φ is invariant under T (since `map T S ≤ S` means T maps S into itself).
- Conclusion: There exists `c : K` such that `T = c • (LinearMap.id : V →ₗ[K] V)`. That is, T is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement assumes: Every subspace of V of dimension `dim V - 1` (i.e., every hyperplane) is T-invariant, and concludes that T is a scalar multiple of the identity.
- In a finite-dimensional vector space over a field, the codimension-1 subspaces (hyperplanes) are precisely the kernels of nonzero linear functionals `φ : V → K`. Thus, quantifying over all nonzero φ and requiring `ker φ` to be T-invariant is equivalent to requiring every hyperplane to be T-invariant.
- Therefore, the hypothesis in the Lean code is exactly the same condition, expressed via kernels of nonzero functionals, and the conclusion matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary fake definitions are made; no vacuous placeholders.
- The only extra typeclass `[SMul K (V →ₗ[K] V)]` is standard and does not change the content.
- The finite-dimensional assumption is included, which is standard and implicit in the natural statement.
- The translation captures precisely the intended meaning: invariance of all hyperplanes implies T is a scalar multiple of the identity.

Hence, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Putnam_exercise_2018_b4 (a : ℝ) (x : ℕ → ℝ)` introduces a real parameter `a` and a real sequence `x : ℕ → ℝ`.
- `(h0 : x 0 = 1) (h1 : x 1 = a) (h2 : x 2 = a)` encode the initial conditions `x₀ = 1`, `x₁ = a`, `x₂ = a`.
- `(hrecur : ∀ n : ℕ, 2 ≤ n → x (n+1) = 2 * x n * x (n-1) - x (n-2))` encodes the recurrence for all `n ≥ 2`: `x_{n+1} = 2 x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}`.
- `(hex : ∃ n, x n = 0)` states that there exists an index with `x_n = 0`.
- The conclusion `∃ p : ℕ, p > 0 ∧ ∀ n, x (n+p) = x n` asserts that the sequence is periodic with some positive period `p` (periodic for all indices).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- This exactly matches the natural language statement: given `a` and the specified recurrence/initial conditions, if some term is zero, then the sequence is periodic. The Lean statement universally quantifies over `a` and any sequence `x` satisfying the given relations; this matches “Given a real number a, we define a sequence …”.
- The periodicity is stated in the standard formal way: existence of a positive period such that `x(n+p) = x(n)` for all `n`.
- Indices and recurrence bounds (`n ≥ 2`) align correctly; the recurrence at `n = 2` uses `x3` in terms of `x2, x1, x0` as intended.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only hypotheses and the conclusion. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task.

- The Lean version expresses the equality in ZMod p, which is a standard faithful formalization of a congruence modulo p statement. The sum is exactly over i = 1 to p − 1, since `(Finset.range p)` is {0,1,...,p−1} and erasing 0 leaves {1,...,p−1}. The conditional matches: if (p−1) ∣ k then the sum equals −1, else equals 0. The hypothesis `Nat.Prime p` matches the context where the statement is true. No extraneous assumptions are added, and no cases are omitted (k can be any natural number, including 0, which also matches the conventional statement).

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Equality in ZMod p is equivalent to congruence modulo p in the integers, so the translation is faithful. The direction of the if-then-else matches the natural language: −1 when divisible; 0 when not. The sum indices are correct. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof (allowed per instructions). Thus the code faithfully translates the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat`: Bring in the math library and open the natural number namespace.
- `theorem Putnam_exercise_2001_a5 : ∃! (p : ℕ × ℕ), 1 ≤ p.1 ∧ 1 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.1 ^ (p.2 + 1) - (p.1 + 1) ^ p.2 = 2001 := by sorry`
  This states: There exists a unique pair `p` of natural numbers `(a, n)` such that `a ≥ 1` and `n ≥ 1` and `a^(n+1) - (a+1)^n = 2001` (with subtraction in `ℕ`).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks for unique positive integers `a, n` with `a^(n+1) - (a+1)^n = 2001`.
- The code uses `ℕ` with constraints `1 ≤ p.1` and `1 ≤ p.2`, matching positive integers.
- The uniqueness is expressed as uniqueness of the ordered pair `(a, n)`, which is equivalent to uniqueness of `a, n`.
- Subtraction is in `ℕ` (truncated), but since the right-hand side is `2001 > 0`, it forces `a^(n+1) ≥ (a+1)^n` and thus the truncated subtraction coincides with ordinary subtraction. Hence no discrepancy arises here.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given.

3) Final check:
- The formal statement precisely matches the mathematical statement: existence and uniqueness of positive integers `a, n` satisfying the given equation.
- No meaningful differences detected.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem entire_injective_affine {f : ℂ → ℂ}`: We consider an arbitrary complex function f: ℂ → ℂ.
- `(h_entire : Differentiable (𝕜 := ℂ) f)`: Assumes f is complex-differentiable at every point of ℂ (i.e., holomorphic everywhere, which matches the usual meaning of “entire” in complex analysis).
- `(h_inj : Function.Injective f)`: Assumes f is injective.
- Conclusion: `∃ a b : ℂ, a ≠ 0 ∧ f = fun z => a * z + b`: There exist complex numbers a and b with a ≠ 0 such that f(z) = a z + b for all z.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: “Prove that all entire functions that are also injective take the form f(z) = a z + b, a, b ∈ ℂ and a ≠ 0.” The Lean statement assumes f is entire via `Differentiable (𝕜 := ℂ) f`, assumes f is injective, and concludes the affine form with nonzero slope. This matches the mathematical content exactly. In Mathlib, `Differentiable (𝕜 := ℂ)` is the standard way to express complex differentiability (holomorphicity) everywhere on ℂ, i.e., entire. No extra or missing hypotheses are present, and the conclusion is precisely the affine form with a ≠ 0.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain: ℂ → ℂ as required.
- Entire: captured by `Differentiable (𝕜 := ℂ) f`.
- Injective: `Function.Injective f`.
- Conclusion: existence of a, b ∈ ℂ with a ≠ 0 and f(z) = a z + b. Exactly as stated.
No discrepancies or vacuous/placeholder definitions appear. The statement is a faithful formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem putnam_exercise_1999_b4 {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We consider a real-valued function f on ℝ.
- `(hf : ContDiff ℝ 3 f)`: f is three times continuously differentiable (i.e., has continuous third derivative).
- `(hpos0 : ∀ x, 0 < f x)`: For all real x, f(x) > 0.
- `(hpos1 : ∀ x, 0 < deriv f x)`: For all real x, f'(x) > 0.

- `(hpos3 : ∀ x, 0 < deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x)`: For all real x, f'''(x) > 0.
- `(h_bound : ∀ x, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≤ f x)`: For all real x, f'''(x) ≤ f(x).
- Conclusion: `∀ x, deriv f x < 2 * f x`: For all real x, f'(x) < 2 f(x).

All uses of `deriv` match usual derivatives since `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` guarantees existence and continuity up to the third derivative. The multiplication `2 * f x` corresponds to 2 f(x).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypotheses exactly match: a real function with continuous third derivative, and f, f', f'', f''' all positive everywhere, plus f''' ≤ f everywhere.
- The conclusion exactly matches: f'(x) < 2 f(x) for all x.
- No extraneous or missing conditions are introduced. Using `ContDiff ℝ 3 f` is precisely the formalization of “with a continuous third derivative.”

3) Final check/comparison:
- Domains align (ℝ → ℝ).
- Regularity/positivity/inequality assumptions are identical.
- Conclusion is identical.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions at all. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language problem.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module ℝ V]`: V is a real vector space.
- `def no_real_eigenvalues (T : V →ₗ[ℝ] V) : Prop := ∀ (r : ℝ) (v : V), v ≠ 0 → T v ≠ r • v`:
  This defines the property that T has no real eigenvalues: for every real number r and every nonzero vector v, Tv is not equal to r·v.
- The theorem `Axler_exercise_5_24 (T : V →ₗ[ℝ] V) (h : no_real_eigenvalues T) : ∀ (W : Submodule ℝ V), (∀ v ∈ W, T v ∈ W) → Even (Cardinal.toNat (Module.rank ℝ (↥W))) := by sorry`:
  Given a real-linear operator T with no real eigenvalues, for every submodule W of V such that W is T-invariant (∀ v ∈ W, T v ∈ W), the quantity `Cardinal.toNat (Module.rank ℝ W)` is even. Here, `Module.rank ℝ W` is the (possibly infinite) dimension of W, and `Cardinal.toNat` converts a cardinal dimension to a natural number: it equals the usual finite dimension when W is finite-dimensional, and equals 0 if W is infinite-dimensional.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: “Suppose V is a real vector space and T ∈ L(V) has no eigenvalues. Prove that every subspace of V invariant under T has even dimension.”
- The code’s hypothesis `no_real_eigenvalues` matches “no (real) eigenvalues” over ℝ.
- The invariance condition is correctly expressed as `∀ v ∈ W, T v ∈ W`.
- The conclusion uses `Even (Cardinal.toNat (Module.rank ℝ W))`. For finite-dimensional W, this exactly matches “dim W is even”.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The main subtlety: the Lean theorem quantifies over all subspaces W (not only finite-dimensional ones) and encodes “even dimension” via `Even (Cardinal.toNat (Module.rank …))`. For infinite-dimensional W, `Cardinal.toNat` yields 0, hence the theorem asserts `Even 0`, which is trivially true. The comment notes the intended finite-dimensional scope, but the statement itself does not restrict to finite-dimensional W.
- If the natural language statement is understood (as in Axler’s context) to concern finite-dimensional subspaces, then the Lean statement is a slight extension that also includes infinite-dimensional subspaces with a conventional interpretation that collapses their “dimension” to 0 for parity purposes. This does not contradict the original statement; on finite-dimensional subspaces it is faithful, and beyond that it adds a benign, vacuous case.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful. The only minor discrepancy is the omission of an explicit finite-dimensional assumption on W; however, the formalization still captures the intended claim for finite-dimensional invariant subspaces and does not introduce any false content.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_2_2 : MeasureTheory.integral (MeasureTheory.volume.restrict (Ioi (0 : ℝ))) (fun x => Real.sin x / x) = Real.pi / 2 := by sorry`
  This asserts that the Lebesgue integral (Bochner integral in Mathlib) of the function x ↦ sin x / x over the measurable set (0, ∞) with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure on ℝ equals π/2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is the classical result about the improper integral ∫₀^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2.
- The Lean code uses `MeasureTheory.integral` over the measure restricted to Ioi 0, i.e., the Lebesgue integral over (0, ∞). This is not the same notion as the improper integral. In Mathlib, `MeasureTheory.integral` refers to the Lebesgue integral, which requires absolute integrability (for real-valued functions, integrability means ∫ |f| < ∞). The function sin x / x on (0, ∞) is not absolutely integrable, so the Lebesgue integral in Mathlib sense does not match the improper integral. In fact, without an integrability hypothesis, Mathlib defines `integral` for non-integrable functions in a way that is not meant to capture conditional/improper convergence (and is not the right object here).
- Therefore, while the displayed formula looks similar, the mathematical object in Lean is different from the intended improper integral. A faithful formalization would express the improper integral via limits, e.g., a statement about `Tendsto (fun R => ∫ x in (0)..R, sin x / x) atTop (nhds (Real.pi / 2))`, or using interval integrals and limits.

3) Final comparison:
- Difference: improper integral vs Lebesgue integral. This is a crucial semantic difference; the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the intended statement.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; the issue is solely the mismatch of the integral notion.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- `theorem Putnam_exercise_2018_a5 (f : ℝ → ℝ)`: We consider a function f from the real numbers to the real numbers.

- `(h1 : f 1 = 1)`: f(1) = 1.

Here `deriv^[n] f` denotes the n-fold iterate of the deriv operator, i.e., the nth derivative as a function, so `((deriv^[n] f) x) < 0` reads as f^(n)(x) < 0.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but the task is about the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- The Lean hypotheses exactly match: smoothness (`ContDiff ℝ ⊤ f`), endpoint values `f 0 = 0`, `f 1 = 1`, and nonnegativity `∀ x, 0 ≤ f x`.
- The conclusion exactly matches: existence of a positive integer n (`n > 0`) and a real x with nth derivative negative (`(deriv^[n] f) x < 0`).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem directly states the claim.
- `deriv^[n] f` is the standard Mathlib representation of the nth derivative, consistent with f^(n).

- `variable {M : Type _} [TopologicalSpace M]`: We work in an arbitrary topological space M.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_26 (U : Set M) : IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x ∈ U, x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)`: The theorem states that a subset U of M is open if and only if for every x in U, x is not in the closure of the complement of U.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: ""A set U ⊂ M is open iff none of its points are limits of its complement."" In topology, a point x is a limit point (accumulation point) of a set A if every neighborhood of x meets A \ {x}. The code uses `x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)`. For x ∈ U, we have x ∉ Uᶜ, so ""x is in the closure of Uᶜ"" is equivalent to ""every neighborhood of x meets Uᶜ"", which is exactly the condition that x is a limit point of Uᶜ (since the exclusion of x itself is automatic). Thus, `x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)` means x is not a limit point of the complement. Therefore, the equivalence `IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x ∈ U, x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)` is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (`closure`, complement, `IsOpen`). Any subtlety about ""limit points"" vs ""adherent points"" disappears because x ∈ U, hence x ∉ Uᶜ, so being in the closure of Uᶜ is the same as being a limit point of Uᶜ.

  Natural language: For any integers a, b, c, there exists an integer n with n > 0 such that the integer n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c is not a perfect square (i.e., there is no integer whose square equals that value). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but only the statement matters here.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: For any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive integer n such that sqrt(n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c) is not an integer.
- The Lean statement quantifies over integers a, b, c and asserts the existence of a positive integer n (represented as an Int with 0 < n) such that the quantity inside the square root is not a perfect square integer, expressed as `¬ IsSquare (...)`.
- This is equivalent to saying that the square root is not an integer, since an integer has an integer square root exactly when it is a perfect square. Using `Int` instead of `Nat` for n with `0 < n` is a standard formalization choice and is faithful to “positive integer n”.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no placeholders except the proof hole, which is permitted as we only judge the statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are mathematically equivalent: “sqrt(...) is not an integer” ↔ “the integer inside is not a perfect square” ↔ `¬ IsSquare(...)` over the integers.
- Minor formalization details (using Int and IsSquare instead of explicit sqrt, and positivity as `0 < n`) do not change the meaning.
- No discrepancies found.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators`: bring in Mathlib and notation for big operators like ∑.
- `variable {V : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup V] [InnerProductSpace ℝ V]`: Work in a real inner product space V (with its norm from the inner product).
- `theorem Axler_exercise_6_13 {m : ℕ} (e : Fin m → V) (v : V) (h : Orthonormal ℝ e) : ... := by sorry`:
  • We fix a natural number m, an indexed family e : Fin m → V (i.e., an ordered m-tuple), a vector v : V, and assume `h : Orthonormal ℝ e` (the family (e i) is orthonormal).
  • The statement: `‖v‖ ^ 2 = ∑ i, (@Inner.inner ℝ V _ v (e i)) ^ 2 ↔ v ∈ Submodule.span ℝ (Set.range e)`.
    - Left side: the square of the norm of v equals the finite sum over i : Fin m of the squares of the inner products ⟨v, e i⟩. Since we are over ℝ, squaring removes the need for absolute values, i.e., (⟨v,e⟩)^2 = |⟨v,e⟩|^2.
    - Right side: v lies in the ℝ-linear span of the set of vectors {e i | i ∈ Fin m}, i.e., the span of e1, ..., em.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For an orthonormal list (e1,...,em) in V and v ∈ V, prove that ‖v‖^2 = |⟨v,e1⟩|^2 + ... + |⟨v,em⟩|^2 if and only if v ∈ span(e1,...,em).
- The Lean statement matches this precisely in the real case: an orthonormal m-tuple `e : Fin m → V`, equivalence between the norm-squared equality and v being in the span of the e i. The set `Set.range e` corresponds exactly to {e1,...,em}. The sum over `Fin m` is the finite sum from i = 1 to m. The use of square (without absolute value) is correct over ℝ.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. All concepts used are standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Essentially yes. The only mild specialization is that the Lean code assumes a real inner product space (`InnerProductSpace ℝ V`), whereas the natural language statement, by using absolute values, could cover both real and complex inner product spaces. In the real case, |⟨v, e_i⟩|^2 = (⟨v, e_i⟩)^2, so the Lean statement is exactly the real-field version of the same theorem. This is a standard and faithful specialization and aligns with the original intent.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: Fix a type G with a group structure. This matches “Let G be a group.”
- `variable (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n)`: Fix a natural number n with 1 < n. This corresponds to the natural language “some fixed integer n > 1”. Since n > 1, taking n as a natural number is a harmless specialization (every integer > 1 is a natural number).
- `variable (h : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n)`: Assume the given property holds for all a, b ∈ G: (ab)^n = a^n b^n.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_2_6c (a b : G) : (a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1 := by sorry`: For arbitrary a, b ∈ G, conclude that the commutator `(a b a^{-1} b^{-1})` raised to the power `n(n-1)` equals the identity element `1` (which corresponds to `e`). The exponent is written as `n * (n - 1)` in ℕ, and since `hn : 1 < n`, this indeed represents the intended positive integer exponent.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The hypotheses exactly match: group G, fixed n > 1, and (ab)^n = a^n b^n for all a, b.
- The conclusion matches: for all a, b ∈ G, (a b a^{-1} b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e, with `1` used for the identity. The product `a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹` is Lean’s standard notation for the commutator expression in multiplicative groups.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated with the correct dependencies on n, hn, and h.
- The only minor difference is that n is taken as a natural number rather than an integer. Since the statement assumes n > 1, this is an acceptable specialization and does not change the meaning.

Final check:
The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only the benign specialization from integer n > 1 to natural number n > 1. Therefore, the translation passes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def is_normal ... (T : V →ₗ[𝕜] V) : Prop := T.comp T.adjoint = T.adjoint.comp T`
  This defines a normal operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space over a RCLike field (ℝ or ℂ) as an operator T commuting with its adjoint: TT* = T*T. This is the standard definition and is legitimate.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_7_5 : ∃ (T S : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) →ₗ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)), is_normal T ∧ is_normal S ∧ ¬ is_normal (T + S) := by sorry`
  This states that there exist linear maps T and S on the real 2-dimensional Euclidean space such that T and S are normal but T + S is not normal. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement itself expresses that the set of normal operators on ℝ^2 is not closed under addition, hence not a subspace of L(V) for this specific V.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement asserts a universal claim: for any inner product space V with dim V ≥ 2, the set of normal operators on V is not a subspace of L(V).
- The Lean theorem only provides a single explicit counterexample in a specific space: V = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2). This shows the claim for that single V, not for all V with dim ≥ 2.
- The definition of normal operator used is correct. Demonstrating failure of closure under addition is a valid way to show the set is not a subspace. However, the universal quantification over all such V is not present.
- There is also a potential field mismatch: the original (likely from Axler) typically refers to complex inner product spaces; the Lean code fixes the field to ℝ for the example. While the argument structure is fine, it is a specialization both in the underlying space and the field.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: For all V with dim V ≥ 2 (implicitly over ℝ or ℂ with an inner product), the set of normal operators is not a subspace of L(V).
- Lean: There exist T, S on a particular V = ℝ^2 showing non-closure under addition, hence not a subspace for that specific V.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is a strictly weaker specialization and thus not a faithful translation of the universal claim, though it uses correct concepts and would be a standard first step toward the general result.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `is_normal` is legitimate. The failure is only in the scope/generalization of the theorem statement.

- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_43 (G : Type _) [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 9) : ∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G equipped with a group structure and a finite type structure, if the cardinality of G is 9, then for all elements x, y in G, the product x*y equals y*x. In other words, every group of order 9 is abelian.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian.""
- The Lean theorem assumes G is a group and finite with `Fintype.card G = 9` and concludes commutativity `∀ x y, x * y = y * x`. This is exactly the definition of being abelian. There are no extra hypotheses or restrictions.

3) Final check:
- Same quantification: universal over all groups of order 9.
- Same conclusion: commutativity of multiplication (abelian).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable per instructions.
- No mismatch in technicalities: ""order 9"" is accurately captured by `Fintype.card G = 9`.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_1_26 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] (a : G) : ∃ n : ℕ, a ^ n = (1 : G) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G with a group structure and G finite (Fintype), and any element a in G, there exists a natural number n such that a^n = 1.

Assessment:
- The original statement requires a positive integer n (n > 0). In Lean, `ℕ` includes 0, and there is no condition `0 < n`. Thus the Lean theorem as stated allows n = 0, making the statement trivially true in any group (since a^0 = 1), and not capturing the finiteness hypothesis nor the intended claim about finite order.
- The use of `1 : G` instead of `e` is fine (both denote the identity in multiplicative notation).
- The code includes `[Fintype G]`, matching ""finite group"", but the statement would hold trivially without this assumption due to allowing n = 0; hence it fails to reflect the essential content of the natural language claim.
- There are no auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions; the only issue is the missing positivity constraint.

Final check:
- Original: ∀ a ∈ G (finite group), ∃ n ∈ ℕ with n > 0 such that a^n = e.
- Lean: ∀ a ∈ G (finite group), ∃ n ∈ ℕ (possibly 0) such that a^n = 1.
- Difference: Missing the positivity requirement; thus the formal statement is strictly weaker and in fact trivial. Therefore, not a faithful translation.

How to fix: Require `∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ a ^ n = 1` or use positive naturals `∃ n : ℕ+, a ^ n = 1`.

- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_32a : ∀ t : Set (↥(Set.range (coe : ℕ → ℝ))), IsClopen t := by sorry`
  This states: For every subset `t` of the subtype consisting of real numbers that come from natural numbers (i.e., the copy of ℕ sitting inside ℝ), `t` is clopen in the subspace topology.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement ""Show that every subset of ℕ is clopen"" requires a topology on ℕ. The code explicitly interprets ℕ as the subspace of ℝ via the embedding `ℕ → ℝ`, which is the standard context in many topology exercises (and is consistent with the comment). Under this interpretation, the statement becomes ""Every subset of ℕ (as a subspace of ℝ) is both open and closed in the subspace topology,"" which is exactly what `∀ t, IsClopen t` for `t : Set (↥(Set.range (coe : ℕ → ℝ)))` says.
- `IsClopen` is the standard Mathlib predicate meaning both open and closed.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it's a single theorem statement with a placeholder proof.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The code specifies the topology (subspace topology from ℝ) that the natural language statement left implicit. This is a standard and natural reading of the exercise. The mathematical content matches: every subset of the naturals inside ℝ is clopen. No mismatches or cheating definitions.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- Positives:
  - Domain is the open unit disc {z | |z| < 1}.
  - Boundedness: encoded as ∃ M, ∀ z in disc, |f z| ≤ M.
  - Not identically zero on the disc: encoded as ¬(∀ z in disc, f z = 0).
  - Zeros sequence: z: ℕ → ℂ with |z n| < 1 and f (z n) = 0.
  - Conclusion: Summable (1 - |z n|).
- Issues:
  - Critical: holomorphic_on is defined as True. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not enforce holomorphy. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions and makes the theorem statement not a legitimate formalization of the original hypothesis.
  - Secondary: The code allows any sequence of zeros inside the disc; it does not assert that z enumerates all zeros (possibly with multiplicity). The original phrasing “z_1, z_2, … are its zeros” typically means a full enumeration (often counting multiplicity). The Lean statement is weaker (it claims the Blaschke sum is finite for any sequence of zeros), which is a consequence of the original but not equivalent to it.

3) Final comparison:
- Because holomorphic_on is vacuous, the code does not actually state the intended analytic hypothesis. This alone breaks faithfulness.
- Additionally, the Lean statement is slightly weaker regarding the enumeration of zeros.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- All concepts used (MetricSpace, IsCompact, Nonempty, Disjoint, dist) are standard Mathlib notions; no auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

- Natural language: Assume A, B are compact, disjoint, nonempty subsets of M. Prove existence of a0 ∈ A, b0 ∈ B that minimize distance among all pairs. 
- Lean: Exactly the same hypotheses and conclusion. No extra or missing conditions, and no change in meaning.

Conclusion: for all y in G, φ(y) = y^{-1}, and furthermore, for all a, b in G, a * b = b * a (i.e., G is abelian).

Faithfulness check:

- Hypothesis “more than three-fourths”: 4 * count > 3 * |G| is exactly the strict “> 3/4” condition.

  - Parameter `p : ℝ` and hypothesis `hp : 1 < p` correspond to p > 1.
  - The target `Summable (...)` asserts the series of that sequence converges.
  - The sequence is defined by `if 2 ≤ k then 1 / ((k : ℝ) * (Real.log (k : ℝ)) ^ p) else 0`, i.e., equals 1/(k (log k)^p) for k ≥ 2 and 0 for k = 0,1. This is the standard way to formalize summation from k = 2 to ∞ in Lean.
  - Using `Real.log (k : ℝ)` gives the natural logarithm; for k ≥ 2, log is positive, so the expression is well-defined; the piecewise definition avoids the undefined log(1) issue.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: Prove that the series sum 1/(k (log(k))^p) converges when p > 1. Conventionally, this sum is taken from k ≥ 2 (since log 1 = 0). The Lean code explicitly encodes the series starting at k = 2 by zeroing out the first two terms, which is a faithful and standard formalization.

- The conclusion matches: Summable of the defined sequence, i.e., convergence of the series.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing translation faithfulness.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: Let G be a group.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_2_3 (k : Int) ...`: We fix an integer k.
- Hypotheses:
  - `h0 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ k = a ^ k * b ^ k`: For all a, b in G, (ab)^k = a^k b^k.
  - `h1 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ (k + 1) = a ^ (k + 1) * b ^ (k + 1)`: For all a, b in G, (ab)^(k+1) = a^(k+1) b^(k+1).
  - `h2 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ (k + 2) = a ^ (k + 2) * b ^ (k + 2)`: For all a, b in G, (ab)^(k+2) = a^(k+2) b^(k+2).
- Conclusion: `∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a`: For all a, b in G, a and b commute, i.e., G is abelian.

The exponentiation `^` is over Int, which is appropriate for a group (zpow), so the expression matches the “integers i” in the natural statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language states: If G is a group in which (ab)^i = a^i b^i for three consecutive integers i, then G is abelian.
- The code assumes there exists an integer k for which the property holds for the three consecutive integers k, k+1, k+2, uniformly for all a, b in G, and concludes G is abelian. This is exactly the intended statement (the choice of k witnesses the “three consecutive integers”).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The hypotheses directly encode the required condition.

3) Final check for differences:
- Integers vs naturals: both use integers; aligned.
- Globality of i: The Lean code’s hypotheses assert the equalities hold for all a, b and the specific three consecutive integers k, k+1, k+2, which matches the usual interpretation of the natural statement.
- Conclusion exactly states commutativity for all pairs, i.e., abelian.

No discrepancies found; the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem herstein_exercise_5_1_8 {F : Type*} [Field F] {p : ℕ} (h_char : CharP F p) (hp : p ≠ 0) : ∀ (n : ℕ) (a b : F), (a + b) ^ (p ^ n) = a ^ (p ^ n) + b ^ (p ^ n)` states: For any field F and natural number p such that F has characteristic p (CharP F p) and p ≠ 0, for all natural numbers n and all a, b in F, we have (a + b)^(p^n) = a^(p^n) + b^(p^n). The proof is omitted via `sorry`, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If F is a field of characteristic p ≠ 0, show that (a + b)^m = a^m + b^m, where m = p^n, for all a, b ∈ F and any positive integer n.
- The Lean code exactly captures: field F, characteristic p (CharP F p) with p ≠ 0, and the identity for all a, b and n, with the exponent m implemented as p^n.
- The only deviation is that Lean quantifies over all n : ℕ, including n = 0, whereas the statement requires positive integers n. This is a slight strengthening (the n = 0 case is trivially true), which is acceptable by the guidelines.

3) Final check of differences:
- Difference: The Lean code allows n = 0; the original requires n > 0. This does not introduce any incorrectness and is a benign generalization. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all assumptions are standard Mathlib classes/predicates (Field, CharP). The theorem statement directly encodes the intended property.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful (slightly stronger) formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X]`: We work in a topological space X that is compact (the whole space is compact).
- `lemma Pugh_exercise_2_92 (K : ℕ → Set X) ... : (⋂ n, K n).Nonempty := by sorry`: For a sequence of subsets K n of X indexed by natural numbers, assuming:
  - `hcomp : ∀ n, IsCompact (K n)`: each K n is compact as a subset of X,
  - `hne : ∀ n, (K n).Nonempty`: each K n is nonempty,
  - `hmono : ∀ n, K (n+1) ⊆ K n`: the sequence is nested decreasing,
  the conclusion is that the intersection over all n of K n is nonempty.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: “Give a direct proof that the nested decreasing intersection of nonempty covering compact sets is nonempty.” This is the standard result: in a compact space, a nested decreasing sequence of nonempty compact sets has nonempty intersection. The Lean lemma formalizes exactly this: in a compact space X, with a decreasing sequence of nonempty compact sets K n, the intersection is nonempty. The proof is omitted (as permitted), but the statement itself matches.

3) Final check for differences:
- The word “covering” in the natural language is likely extraneous or a typo; the Lean code does not include any covering property and none is needed for the standard theorem. The rest aligns: nested (hmono), nonempty (hne), compact (hcomp), in a compact space (CompactSpace X), conclusion is intersection nonempty. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions are standard Mathlib.
- The code is a slight generality appropriate for Mathlib (arbitrary compact topological space), which is consistent with the intended statement.

  Natural language: For any group G and elements a, b in G, there exists an element g in G such that g · (a · b) · g⁻¹ = b · a. This is exactly the formal expression of “ab and ba are conjugate elements.” The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for assessing translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_8_15 {p q : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hq : Nat.Prime q) (hdiv : q ∣ p - 1) :` introduces primes p and q with the condition q divides p−1.
- `∀ {G H : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] [Group H] [Fintype H],` quantifies over two finite groups G and H.

- `Nonempty (G ≃* H)` concludes there exists a group isomorphism between G and H.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If p > q are primes with q | p − 1, then any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic.
- The Lean statement requires p and q to be primes and q | p − 1, and then states that for any two finite groups of order pq which are nonabelian, there exists an isomorphism between them. This directly matches the assertion “any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic.”
- The explicit inequality p > q is not included, but it is implied by q | p − 1 (since q ≥ 2, q ≤ p − 1, hence p > q). Therefore, omitting p > q does not change the meaning.
- The encoding of “nonabelian” as existence of noncommuting elements is correct (equivalent to not abelian).

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts. There are no auxiliary definitions.
- The code does not assert existence of nonabelian groups, only uniqueness up to isomorphism, which matches the phrasing “any two ... are isomorphic.” The natural language statement likewise does not explicitly assert existence.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def iter_deriv : ℕ → (ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → ℂ | 0, f => f | n+1, f => deriv (iter_deriv n f)`
  This defines the n-th iterated derivative of a complex function f: iter_deriv 0 f = f, and iter_deriv (n+1) f is the (complex) derivative of iter_deriv n f. So iter_deriv n f is the n-th derivative f^(n).

- Theorem statement:
  `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_2_13 (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hd : Differentiable ℂ f)
    (h : ∀ z0 : ℂ, ∃ n : ℕ, iter_deriv n f z0 = 0) :
    ∃ N : ℕ, iter_deriv (N + 1) f = fun _ => 0 := by sorry`

  In words: Let f: ℂ → ℂ be complex-differentiable everywhere (entire/holomorphic everywhere). Assume that for every z0 ∈ ℂ there exists some n ≥ 0 such that the n-th derivative of f at z0 is zero. Then there exists an integer N such that the (N+1)-st derivative of f is identically zero on ℂ.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language assumption: f is analytic on ℂ (entire), and for each z0 the Taylor expansion f(z) = ∑ c_n (z − z0)^n has at least one coefficient c_n equal to 0. Since in complex analysis c_n = f^(n)(z0)/n!, the condition “some c_n = 0” is equivalent to “for some n, f^(n)(z0) = 0”. This matches the Lean hypothesis `h : ∀ z0, ∃ n, iter_deriv n f z0 = 0` exactly (allowing n = 0 corresponds to c_0 = f(z0)). The assumption `Differentiable ℂ f` matches “analytic everywhere” in the complex setting (holomorphic ⇒ analytic).

- Natural language conclusion: Prove that f is a polynomial. The Lean conclusion is stronger: it asserts the existence of N such that f^(N+1) ≡ 0. This implies that f is a polynomial of degree at most N. Thus the Lean statement is a legitimate (stronger) formalization of the desired conclusion.

3) Final check for faithfulness and potential red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `iter_deriv` is a genuine recursive definition using Mathlib’s `deriv`.
- The mapping from “coefficient equals zero” to “derivative equals zero” is correct (the factorial factor is irrelevant for zero).
- The conclusion is slightly stronger than “f is a polynomial,” which is acceptable and indeed implies the desired result.
- The code does not introduce extraneous or misleading auxiliary constructs.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful and even slightly stronger formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

  Let G be a type with a group structure, assumed finite (Fintype G) and nontrivial, and with an instance allowing exponentiation by integers (irrelevant to the statement itself).
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ H : Subgroup G, H = (⊥ : Subgroup G) ∨ H = (⊤ : Subgroup G)`:
  For every subgroup H of G, H is either the trivial subgroup ⊥ or the whole group ⊤. Equivalently, G has no nontrivial proper subgroups; the only subgroups are ⊥ and ⊤.
- Conclusion: `∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ Fintype.card G = p ∧ IsCyclic G`:
  There exists a natural number p such that p is prime, the cardinality (order) of G is p, and G is cyclic.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""If a group G has no proper subgroups, prove that G is cyclic of order p, where p is a prime number.""
- The standard, intended meaning is ""no nontrivial proper subgroups"" (since otherwise the statement is false for nontrivial groups due to the existence of the trivial subgroup). The Lean hypothesis precisely formalizes the intended meaning by requiring that the only subgroups are ⊥ and ⊤.
- The conclusion in Lean matches exactly: G has prime order p and is cyclic.

3) Differences and assessment:
- The Lean statement includes additional assumptions: [Fintype G] (finiteness) and [Nontrivial G]. These are stronger than necessary: finiteness follows from the hypothesis and conclusion, and nontriviality is implicit in the usual reading (a trivial group would fail the hypothesis if interpreted as ""no proper subgroups"" including the trivial subgroup). These are a mild specialization and do not distort the mathematical content of the theorem; they are acceptable for a faithful translation.
- The use of `[Pow G ℤ]` is a technical typeclass and does not affect the semantics of the statement.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement with `by sorry` for the proof. This is acceptable under the auditing guidelines, since we are checking the fidelity of the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the intended mathematical statement, with a mild specialization (explicit finiteness and nontriviality) that is acceptable.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We work with an arbitrary group G.
- The theorem `Herstein_exercise_2_5_23` assumes a hypothesis `h : ∀ a b : G, b * a * b⁻¹ ∈ Subgroup.zpowers a`. Here `Subgroup.zpowers a` is the cyclic subgroup generated by a (all integer powers a^j, j ∈ ℤ). The hypothesis thus says: for every a, b in G, the conjugate b a b⁻¹ lies in the cyclic subgroup generated by a. Equivalently, every cyclic subgroup is normal.
- The conclusion is: for any a b : G, there exists an integer j such that `b * a = (a ^ j) * b`. This is exactly the same as saying `b a b⁻¹ = a^j` for some integer j (by multiplying on the right by b), i.e., the conjugate of a lies in the cyclic subgroup generated by a.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: ""Let G be a group such that all subgroups of G are normal in G. If a, b ∈ G, prove that ba = a^j b for some j.""
- The Lean code assumes a weaker hypothesis: it only requires that the cyclic subgroup generated by any a is normal (equivalently, that b a b⁻¹ ∈ ⟨a⟩ for all a, b), not that every subgroup of G is normal. The conclusion is exactly the desired statement: ∃ j ∈ ℤ such that ba = a^j b.

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- The conclusion matches exactly.
- The hypothesis in Lean is strictly weaker: ""every cyclic subgroup is normal"" versus the original ""every subgroup is normal."" However, the original assumption implies the Lean assumption, and the conclusion only needs the weaker assumption. Thus the Lean statement is a slight generalization of the original, with no loss of correctness for the claimed result.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. `Subgroup.zpowers` is standard in Mathlib; `Int`-exponentiation is appropriate for groups.

Verdict: The code is a faithful translation up to a harmless and standard generalization (weaker hypothesis but same conclusion). This fits the guideline allowing slight generalizations.

The `by sorry` is a placeholder for the actual construction/proof, but the type precisely states the isomorphism.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement defines T as the group of 2×2 matrices over Z₂ with nonzero determinant. Over ZMod 2 (a field), this is exactly the general linear group GL(2, Z₂). In Lean, `GL (Fin 2) (ZMod 2)` is the group of invertible 2×2 matrices over Z₂.
- S₃ is the symmetric group on 3 elements; in Lean, this is `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`.
- The statement being asserted is an isomorphism `≃*`, which is even stronger than mere existence of an isomorphism. This matches (and slightly strengthens) the original claim that T is isomorphic to S₃.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the code directly states the isomorphism type. The use of `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted but does not affect the correctness of the translation of the statement.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically: GL(2, Z₂) ≅ S₃. The Lean code faithfully represents T as `GL (Fin 2) (ZMod 2)` and S₃ as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`. No discrepancies.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: α is an arbitrary type. σ, τ : α ≃ α are permutations (equivalences of α).
- Hypothesis h_disj: ∀ x, σ x = x ∨ τ x = x. This formalizes “σ and τ disturb no common element”: for every x, at least one of σ or τ fixes x, i.e., there is no x moved by both.
- Hypothesis h_mul: σ.trans τ = Equiv.refl α. Here Equiv.trans composes equivalences as (σ.trans τ) x = τ (σ x), i.e., it is τ ∘ σ. Thus h_mul is τ ∘ σ = id.
- Conclusion: σ = Equiv.refl α ∧ τ = Equiv.refl α, i.e., σ = τ = e.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “If σ, τ are two permutations that disturb no common element and σ τ = e, then σ = τ = e.”
- The “disturb no common element” condition is faithfully captured by ∀ x, σ x = x ∨ τ x = x; this is equivalent to saying there is no x with σ x ≠ x and τ x ≠ x (supports are disjoint), and is standard.
- The product condition: the code assumes τ ∘ σ = id (since σ.trans τ = τ ∘ σ), while the natural language states σ τ = e. In many algebra texts στ denotes σ ∘ τ (apply τ then σ). However, since σ and τ are bijections, τ ∘ σ = id is equivalent to σ ∘ τ = id (each is the inverse of the other). Hence the hypothesis is effectively the same, and the conclusion is identical. The comment in the code says “σ ∘ τ = id” but the code uses σ.trans τ, which denotes τ ∘ σ; this is a minor notational mismatch but does not change the mathematical content due to invertibility of permutations.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is precise and uses standard Mathlib notions (Equiv, Equiv.refl, Equiv.trans).

Final check:
- The mathematical statements are the same: permutations with disjoint supports whose product is the identity must both be the identity. The slight composition-order notation in the code is equivalent for permutations. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def IsModulusOfContinuity (mu : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := ...`
  This defines what it means for a function mu: ℝ → ℝ to be a modulus of continuity. The conditions are:
  - `StrictMonoOn mu (Ioi 0)`: mu is strictly increasing on the open interval (0, ∞).
  - `ContinuousOn mu (Ioi 0)`: mu is continuous on (0, ∞).
  - `(∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ s, 0 < s → s < δ → mu s < ε)`: as s → 0+ (with s > 0), mu(s) → 0; i.e., the limit from the right is 0.
  - `(∀ s > 0, 0 < mu s)`: for s > 0, mu(s) > 0 (i.e., the codomain is positive on (0, ∞)).
  This matches the usual notion of a modulus of continuity on (0, ∞), except that mu is defined on all ℝ but only constrained on (0, ∞), which is a harmless extension.

- `theorem exists_modulus_iff_uniform_continuous {a b : ℝ} (hab : a < b) {f : ℝ → ℝ} :
  UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b) ↔
  ∃ mu : ℝ → ℝ, IsModulusOfContinuity mu ∧
    ∀ x y, x ∈ Icc a b → y ∈ Icc a b → abs (f x - f y) ≤ mu (abs (x - y)) := ...`
  This states: for a < b and a function f: ℝ → ℝ, f is uniformly continuous on the closed interval [a, b] if and only if there exists a function mu: ℝ → ℝ which is a modulus of continuity (as defined above) and such that for all x, y ∈ [a, b], |f(x) − f(y)| ≤ mu(|x − y|).

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines a modulus of continuity: a continuous, strictly increasing function μ: (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) with μ(s) → 0 as s → 0. The code matches this: continuity and strict monotonicity are required on (0, ∞), μ(s) → 0 as s → 0+ is encoded via the ε-δ condition, and positivity on (0, ∞) is ensured (codomain positivity).
- The natural language says: f has modulus μ if |f(s) − f(t)| ≤ μ(|s − t|) for all s, t in [a, b]. The code states exactly this inequality for all x, y ∈ Icc a b, using abs values.
- The main claim: a function on [a, b] is uniformly continuous iff it has a modulus of continuity. The theorem states uniform continuity on Icc a b is equivalent to existence of such a μ satisfying the inequality on Icc a b. This is precisely the same logical content.

3) Potential discrepancies and their impact:
- Domain/codomain of μ: The natural language uses μ: (0, ∞) → (0, ∞); the code takes μ: ℝ → ℝ but constrains it only on (0, ∞) and requires positivity there. This is a benign extension and captures the intended definition; it even allows specifying μ(0), which is sometimes convenient for the inequality when x = y. The inequality in the code does evaluate μ at 0 (when x = y), but since μ is existentially chosen, it can be defined to satisfy μ(0) ≥ 0. This does not conflict with the natural language intent.
- The code assumes a < b, whereas the natural language allows possibly a = b. This is a harmless specialization; the singleton case is trivial and excluding it does not materially alter the statement.
- No vacuous placeholders: IsModulusOfContinuity is a genuine definition, not a placeholder. The theorem statement itself uses standard Mathlib notions (UniformContinuousOn, Icc). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for our auditing of statement faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only minor technical adjustments that are standard and do not change the mathematical meaning.

- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G] {H : Type _} [Group H]`: Let G and H be types equipped with group structures.
- `theorem center_prod : Subgroup.center (G × H) = Subgroup.prod (Subgroup.center (G := G)) (Subgroup.center (G := H)) := by sorry`: The theorem states that the center of the product group G × H is equal to the subgroup `Subgroup.prod` of the centers of G and H, i.e., the set of pairs (g, h) with g in the center of G and h in the center of H. The proof is omitted (using `sorry`), but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asserts: Z(G × H) = Z(G) × Z(H). In Lean, `Subgroup.center (G × H)` denotes the center of G × H. `Subgroup.prod (Subgroup.center (G := G)) (Subgroup.center (G := H))` is exactly the subgroup of G × H consisting of pairs whose components lie in the respective centers, i.e., Z(G) × Z(H). Thus the Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement uses existing Mathlib notions (`Subgroup.center`, `Subgroup.prod`). The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this task since we are only auditing the translation of the statement.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same: both claim equality (not just isomorphism) of subgroups inside G × H between the center of the product and the product of centers. No discrepancies.

- def is_characteristic {G : Type u} [Group G] (H : Subgroup G) : Prop := ∀ (f : G ≃* G), Subgroup.map (MulEquiv.toMonoidHom f) H = H
  Translation: A subgroup H of a group G is characteristic if for every group automorphism f : G ≃* G, the image of H under f (expressed as Subgroup.map f.toMonoidHom H) equals H. This is the standard definition of a characteristic subgroup: invariance under all automorphisms. The definition is legitimate and not vacuous.

  Translation: Let G be a finite abelian group. Let p be a prime, and m, n be natural numbers such that p does not divide m, and |G| = p^n m. Let H be a subgroup of G with |H| = p^n. Then H is characteristic in G. The [Fintype H] assumption is a harmless technical typeclass instance (it follows from [Fintype G] but may not be inferred automatically); it does not change the mathematical statement.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: G abelian, |G| = p^n m with p prime and p ∤ m; H ≤ G has order p^n; prove H is characteristic in G.
- Lean statement: Exactly the same hypotheses and conclusion. The definition of characteristic used matches the standard notion (invariance under all automorphisms). All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no placeholders or vacuous definitions). No extraneous restrictions are added, and no generalization/specialization beyond the intended statement.

- `theorem artin_exercise_10_1_13 {R : Type _} [Ring R] {x : R} (hx : IsNilpotent x) : IsUnit (1 + x) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with a ring structure, and any element x in R, if x is nilpotent (Mathlib’s `IsNilpotent x` meaning there exists n such that x^n = 0), then 1 + x is a unit in R (Mathlib’s `IsUnit (1 + x)`).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language result: from nilpotent x, deduce that 1 + x is invertible. It uses Mathlib’s standard predicate `IsNilpotent` and conclusion `IsUnit`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated directly in Mathlib terms.
- The use of `[Ring R]` aligns with the usual setting; the result holds in noncommutative rings as well, so this is not an over/under generalization.

3) Final check:
- The formal and informal statements are the same. Potential minor technicality: Mathlib’s `IsNilpotent x` is `∃ n, x^n = 0` (possibly allowing n = 0), but this only affects the trivial ring case, where the conclusion still holds. This is a standard acceptable formalization detail.
- No discrepancies affecting correctness or meaning.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.

- Docstring: ""For a fixed `a : R` the set `L(a) := { x | x * a = 0 }` is an ideal."" This describes the intended content.
- `def Herstein_exercise_4_3_1 (a : R) : Ideal R := by sorry`: This attempts to define, for each a, an Ideal R. However, it gives no construction and uses `sorry` as a placeholder.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Given a commutative ring R and a ∈ R, define L(a) = {x | xa = 0} and prove L(a) is an ideal of R.
- A faithful Lean formalization would either:
  - Define the ideal whose carrier is exactly the set {x | x * a = 0} by supplying the Ideal structure fields, or
  - State and prove a theorem that this set forms an ideal (or identify it with a standard construction like the annihilator).
- The provided code does neither: it does not even mention the set {x | x * a = 0} in the term, only in the docstring, and relies entirely on `sorry`. As per the guidelines, this is a vacuous placeholder and not a legitimate translation.
- Even though the ambient typeclass `[CommRing R]` is appropriate (ensuring a two-sided Ideal), and if the `sorry` were replaced by a proper construction matching the docstring, the result would likely be faithful, the current code is not.

Final comparison:
- Natural statement: L(a) = {x | xa = 0} is an ideal.
- Lean code: Defines some Ideal R for each a, with no guarantee it corresponds to L(a); uses `sorry` to fill in everything. Therefore, not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous placeholder is used. If fixed properly to construct the ideal with carrier {x | x * a = 0}, it would be faithful. This matches the rubric for a grade around 6.

  Natural language: Let I be an ideal of the ring of Gaussian integers ℤ[i]. Assume I is nonzero (I ≠ {0}, i.e., I ≠ ⊥). Then there exists an integer n such that n ≠ 0 and, when viewed as a Gaussian integer via the canonical embedding ℤ → ℤ[i], the element (n : GaussianInt) lies in I. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer.""
- The Lean statement precisely asserts that for any ideal I of GaussianInt with I ≠ ⊥, there exists n ∈ ℤ, n ≠ 0, such that its image in GaussianInt belongs to I. This exactly captures ""contains a nonzero integer"" within ℤ[i].

3) Final check for differences:
- Nonzero ideal ↔ `I ≠ ⊥`: matches.
- Contains a nonzero integer ↔ `∃ n : ℤ, n ≠ 0 ∧ (n : GaussianInt) ∈ I`: matches via the standard coercion from ℤ to GaussianInt.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The names and structures (`Ideal`, `GaussianInt`) are standard in Mathlib.
- No extra conditions or omissions. The scope matches exactly.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable {F : Type*} [Field F]`: Fix a type F with a field structure.
- `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]`: Fix a type V with an additive commutative group structure and an F-module structure; i.e., V is a vector space over F.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem Artin_exercise_3_7_2 (n : Nat) (s : Fin n → Submodule F V) (h : ∀ i, s i ≠ ⊤) : ∃ v : V, ∀ i, v ∉ s i`.
  Natural language: For any finite family of subspaces of V indexed by `Fin n`, each of which is proper (`s i ≠ ⊤`), there exists a vector v in V that is not contained in any of the subspaces. Equivalently, V is not equal to the union of finitely many proper subspaces.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: ""Let V be a vector space over an infinite field F. Prove that V is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.""
- Lean code captures: ""V is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces"" via existence of v outside all s i.
- Critical discrepancy: The Lean code does not assume that F is infinite. The original requires F to be an infinite field. Without `[Infinite F]`, the Lean theorem claims a stronger statement that is false in general (e.g., over a finite field like F_2, V = F_2^2 is the union of three 1-dimensional proper subspaces). Thus the Lean statement is not faithful to the original.

Other checks:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; only a theorem with an omitted proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Using `Submodule F V` correctly represents linear subspaces.
- Indexing by `Fin n` faithfully represents finitely many subspaces.

Final assessment:
- The only, but essential, mismatch is the missing assumption that F is infinite. This changes the truth of the statement and makes the formal statement strictly stronger (and false in general), hence not faithful.

  • Types F, K with instances `[Field F] [Field K]` declare F and K are fields.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The Lean theorem states exactly: if a^2 is algebraic over F, then a is algebraic over F, with F a subfield of K formalized via an `Algebra F K` instance. This matches the natural language statement precisely.

The natural language statement: ""Let I, J be ideals of a ring R such that I+J=R. Prove that IJ = I ∩ J."" The Lean statement exactly asserts: If I + J = ⊤ then I * J = I ⊓ J. In the lattice of ideals, ⊓ is intersection, and ⊤ is the whole ring. So the content matches: IJ equals I ∩ J under the assumption I + J = R.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The only slight difference is that Lean assumes `[CommRing R]` (commutative ring), while the natural statement says ""ring R"" without specifying commutativity. The theorem is true in the commutative case and also for two-sided ideals in general rings, but Mathlib's `Ideal R` requires a commutative ring. This is a standard and acceptable specialization for formalization and does not change the essence of the statement.

- Conclusion: `∀ x, x ∈ A → x ∈ Subgroup.closure ({b} : Set G) → x = 1`: For every x, if x is in A and in the subgroup generated by b (i.e., <b> = Subgroup.closure {b}), then x = 1. In other words, A ∩ <b> ⊆ {1}.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The original statement: If A is a normal subgroup of G, b ∈ G has prime order p, and b ∉ A, then A ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}.
The Lean statement proves that any element in A ∩ ⟨b⟩ must be 1, i.e., A ∩ ⟨b⟩ ⊆ {1}. Since 1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ ⟨b⟩ always hold (A is a subgroup; ⟨b⟩ is a subgroup), the reverse inclusion {1} ⊆ A ∩ ⟨b⟩ is automatic. Thus, the Lean statement is equivalent to A ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {1}.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Normality of A: Included as a hypothesis in Lean exactly as in the statement (though not strictly necessary for the result). 
- b of prime order p and b ∉ A: Included faithfully as `hp : p.Prime`, `hb : orderOf b = p`, and `hbnot : b ∉ A`.
- Intersection with the cyclic subgroup generated by b: Represented as `Subgroup.closure ({b} : Set G)`, which is exactly ⟨b⟩.
- Conclusion: Lean shows any element in the intersection must be 1, which is equivalent to the intersection being {1} since 1 is always in both A and ⟨b⟩.
No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; there are no auxiliary fake definitions. The formulation is fully faithful, differing only in phrasing (subset characterization vs. equality), but mathematically equivalent in this context.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- We work with types G and G' equipped with group structures.
- φ : G →* G' is a group homomorphism.
- N : Subgroup G is a subgroup of G.
- The lemma Herstein_exercise_2_7_7 assumes:
  - hφ : Surjective (φ : G → G') meaning φ is onto G'.
  - hN : ∀ g n, n ∈ N → g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N, i.e., for every g in G and n in N, the conjugate g n g⁻¹ lies in N. This is exactly the conjugation characterization of N being normal in G.
- The conclusion is: ∀ g' m, m ∈ N.map φ → g' * m * g'⁻¹ ∈ N.map φ, i.e., for every g' in G' and for every m in the image subgroup φ(N) = N.map φ, the conjugate g' m g'⁻¹ lies in φ(N). This states normality of φ(N) in G' via the conjugation property in G'.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The natural statement: If φ is a homomorphism of G onto G' and N is normal in G, then φ(N) is normal in G'.
- In the code, φ is a homomorphism and surjective (onto). N is assumed normal through the standard conjugation property. The conclusion is the conjugation property for N.map φ in G', i.e., φ(N) is normal in G'. This matches exactly.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Assumptions: onto homomorphism and normality of N are present and correctly encoded.
- Conclusion: normality of the image subgroup is stated correctly as closure under conjugation in G'.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib objects (Group, Subgroup, map, Surjective). The slight choice to use the conjugation characterization instead of the Normal predicate is mathematically equivalent.
- Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We are working with a group G.
- `open MulEquiv`: We will use multiplicative equivalences (group isomorphisms) notation.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_11_7 {p : ℕ} (P : Sylow p G) (h_unique : ∀ Q : Sylow p G, Q = P) (φ : G ≃* G) : Subgroup.map (φ.toMonoidHom : G →* G) P.toSubgroup = P.toSubgroup := by sorry`
  This states: Let p be a natural number, P a Sylow p-subgroup of G, h_unique the statement that every Sylow p-subgroup Q of G equals P (i.e., P is the unique Sylow p-subgroup), and φ an automorphism of G (a group isomorphism G ≃* G). Then the image of the subgroup P under φ, expressed as `Subgroup.map (φ.toMonoidHom) P.toSubgroup`, is equal to P itself.
  In words: If P is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of G, then every automorphism φ of G maps P to itself.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
Natural language: “If P ⫳ G, P a p-Sylow subgroup of G, prove that φ(P) = P for every automorphism φ of G.” This assumes P is normal in G and is a p-Sylow subgroup, and concludes that any automorphism sends P to itself.
The Lean code assumes P is a Sylow p-subgroup and is the unique such Sylow subgroup (`h_unique`). In finite group theory, a Sylow p-subgroup is normal if and only if it is unique among Sylow p-subgroups. Thus the code’s hypothesis is equivalent to the given hypothesis (normality) in the usual Sylow context. The conclusion in Lean, `Subgroup.map φ P = P`, is exactly the formal version of φ(P) = P as a subgroup.

3) Final check:
- Automorphism: φ : G ≃* G matches “automorphism of G”.
- Image of P: `Subgroup.map (φ.toMonoidHom) P.toSubgroup` matches φ(P).
- Hypotheses: “P is Sylow p-subgroup and unique” is equivalent to “P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup” (since all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate), which matches the natural language assumption P ⫳ G. No extraneous or vacuous definitions are used, only a theorem statement with an omitted proof, which is acceptable per instructions.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- `noncomputable section` allows use of noncomputable definitions (e.g., real square roots).
- `open Polynomial` opens the polynomial namespace for notation like `X` and `C`.
- The comment states the intended theorem: Let p(x) = x^5 + sqrt(2) x^3 + sqrt(5) x^2 + sqrt(7) x + sqrt(11). If a ∈ ℂ is a root of p, then a is algebraic over ℚ of degree at most 80.
- `def p : Polynomial Complex := ...` defines the polynomial p with coefficients in ℂ. The coefficients are `Complex.ofReal (Real.sqrt n)` for n = 2, 5, 7, 11, inserted via `C` into the polynomial ring. The terms are exactly X^5, plus sqrt(2)·X^3, plus sqrt(5)·X^2, plus sqrt(7)·X, plus sqrt(11).
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_5_4_3 (a : Complex) : p.eval a = 0 -> IsAlgebraic ℚ a ∧ (Polynomial.degree (minpoly ℚ a) ≤ (80 : WithBot ℕ)) := by sorry` states: For any complex number a, if p(a) = 0, then a is algebraic over ℚ and the (WithBot) degree of its minimal polynomial over ℚ is ≤ 80. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation checking.
- `end` closes the noncomputable section.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: If a ∈ C (ℂ) with p(a) = 0 for p(x) = x^5 + sqrt(2)x^3 + sqrt(5)x^2 + sqrt(7)x + sqrt(11), show a is algebraic over ℚ of degree at most 80.
- The code defines exactly that polynomial over ℂ using real square roots embedded into ℂ and asserts: If a is a root, then a is algebraic over ℚ and deg(minpoly ℚ a) ≤ 80. This matches “algebraic over ℚ of degree at most 80.” Using `Polynomial.degree (minpoly ℚ a) ≤ (80 : WithBot ℕ)` is a standard formalization of “degree ≤ 80,” since the minimal polynomial is nonzero and hence has a finite degree.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: ℂ in both statements.
- Polynomial: Matches term-by-term with the correct coefficients and powers.
- Conclusion: Algebraic over ℚ and degree ≤ 80 matches the natural language.
- No extraneous assumptions or weakenings. The use of WithBot for degree is a harmless technicality.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used for the objects; the only `sorry` is in the proof, which is permitted for translation assessment.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_11_13_3 : Set.Infinite {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ Int.ModEq (4 : Int) (p : Int) (-1)} := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem stating: The set of natural numbers p such that p is prime and, viewed as an integer, p is congruent to −1 modulo 4, is infinite. Here, `Nat.Prime p` specifies that p is a prime natural, and `Int.ModEq (4 : Int) (p : Int) (-1)` expresses the congruence p ≡ −1 (mod 4) in the integers.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement is: “Prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to −1 (modulo 4).” The Lean statement asserts that the set of primes p with p ≡ −1 (mod 4) is infinite. This is exactly the same claim, formalized using `Set.Infinite` and `Int.ModEq`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The set is over ℕ with `Nat.Prime p`, matching usual primes. The congruence is taken in ℤ using `Int.ModEq` with `p` cast to ℤ, which is appropriate and equivalent to saying p ≡ 3 (mod 4) in ℕ. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. There are no changes in scope, generality, or meaning.
Thus, the code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which provides standard group theory notions including `orderOf`.
- `theorem order_of_inv_eq {G : Type _} [Group G] (x : G) : orderOf x = orderOf x⁻¹ := by sorry`: For any type `G` with a group structure, and any element `x : G`, the order of `x` equals the order of its inverse `x⁻¹`. Here `orderOf` is Mathlib's standard definition of the order of a group element (a natural number, with `0` representing infinite order).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: For x in G, show that x and x^{-1} have the same order. The Lean statement precisely asserts `orderOf x = orderOf x⁻¹` for any group `G` and any element `x`. This matches exactly. The use of `orderOf` captures both finite and infinite order via `0` for the latter, which aligns with the mathematical intent that the orders are the same in all cases.

3) Final check:
- Assumptions: Both assume `G` is a group and `x` is an element of `G`.
- Claim: Equality of the orders of `x` and `x^{-1}`.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- Context: F is a type with a Field structure. p : ℕ. Assumptions: CharP F p (the characteristic of F is p) and p ≠ 0 (so positive characteristic). n : ℕ is an arbitrary natural number.
- Statement: Polynomial.Separable (((Polynomial.X : Polynomial F) ^ (p ^ n)) - (Polynomial.X : Polynomial F)).
- Meaning: The polynomial X^(p^n) − X over F is separable (i.e., has no repeated roots in its splitting field), which encodes “all roots are distinct.”

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: If F has characteristic p ≠ 0, then all roots of x^m − x, where m = p^n, are distinct.
- The Lean statement uses separability to formalize “all roots distinct,” which is accurate.
- It correctly uses characteristic p ≠ 0 and takes m = p^n (implicitly via X^(p^n)).

Step 3: Check for mismatches
- Edge case n = 0: In Lean, n : ℕ is unrestricted. If n = 0, then m = p^0 = 1, so the polynomial is X^1 − X = 0 (the zero polynomial), which is not separable. Thus the Lean statement is false for n = 0.
- The natural-language statement, as written, does not explicitly exclude n = 0. Typically in algebra texts, n is intended to be a positive integer; however, this is not stated. If taken literally with n = 0 allowed, the statement is ill-posed/false for the zero polynomial. Therefore, the Lean statement should have required n > 0 (or m > 1) to match the intended mathematical claim.
- Aside from this, the formalization is faithful: field, positive characteristic, polynomial X^(p^n) − X, and separability.

Conclusion: Nearly faithful, but it omits the necessary restriction n > 0, making the formal statement strictly stronger (and actually false) at n = 0. No vacuous definitions; no auxiliary red flags.

  Natural language: For any group G and element x in G, if the order of x (Mathlib’s `orderOf x`) equals a natural number n and n > 0, then the inverse of x equals x raised to the (n − 1) power.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: If |x| = n for some positive integer n, then x^{-1} = x^{n-1}. This matches exactly the Lean statement: `orderOf x = n` captures |x| = n; `hn : 0 < n` encodes “positive integer”; conclusion is `x⁻¹ = x^(n - 1)`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of `orderOf` is standard in Mathlib and matches the group-theoretic notion. The theorem is stated for an arbitrary group `[Group G]`, as in the informal statement.

3) Final comparison for differences:
- No discrepancy: the hypotheses and conclusion coincide precisely with the informal statement. The extra hypothesis `0 < n` matches “positive integer”. Using natural-number exponentiation for `x^(n-1)` is appropriate. No over- or under-strengthening.

Therefore, the Lean code faithfully formalizes the given statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `import Mathlib` and a docstring describing the statement.
- Theorem `Artin_exercise_6_4_2`: Let G be a type with `[Group G]` and `[Fintype G]`, and let p, q be natural numbers with `Nat.Prime p` and `Nat.Prime q`. Assume `Fintype.card G = p * q`.
- Conclusion: There exists a subgroup `N : Subgroup G` such that:
  • `(∀ g x, x ∈ N → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N)`: for all g and all x in N, the conjugate g x g⁻¹ is in N. Since N is a subgroup, this condition is exactly the usual criterion for N to be normal (conjugation-invariance for all g). 
  • `N ≠ ⊥`: N is not the trivial subgroup.
  • `N ≠ ⊤`: N is not the whole group. 
Thus the statement asserts the existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup of G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The English statement “No group of order p q, where p and q are prime, is simple” is equivalent to: for any group G with |G| = p q, there exists a normal subgroup which is nontrivial and proper. The Lean statement explicitly produces such an N and spells out normality via closure under conjugation and nontrivial/proper via `N ≠ ⊥` and `N ≠ ⊤`. This is precisely the constructive negation of simplicity.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not use the `Simple` predicate, but gives an equivalent formulation (existence of a nontrivial proper normal subgroup). This is faithful.
- It allows p = q (order p^2), which is covered by the English phrasing as well, since it only says p and q are prime, not necessarily distinct. That’s acceptable and standard.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the only unfinished part is the proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for a translation check. 
- The normality condition is correctly expressed by universal closure under conjugation for all g, which is equivalent to normality for subgroups.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

- The code considers all n : ℕ, including n = 0 (where ZMod 0 is identified with ℤ in Mathlib), but associativity still holds. This is a slight generalization, not a change in meaning. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is a faithful formalization.

Here, `l.prod` is the product a1 * a2 * ... * an if l = [a1, a2, ..., an]. `l.map (fun x => x⁻¹)` produces [a1⁻¹, a2⁻¹, ..., an⁻¹], and `.reverse` makes it [an⁻¹, ..., a2⁻¹, a1⁻¹]; `.prod` then multiplies them in that order.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asserts that for any a1, ..., an in a group G, (a1 a2 ... an)^{-1} = an^{-1} ... a1^{-1}. The Lean theorem states exactly this for an arbitrary finite list, which is the standard formalization of a finite sequence. It even slightly generalizes to the empty list (n = 0), where both sides are 1, which is acceptable and faithful to the intended result for all finite n.

3) Final check/comparison:
- Quantification: Natural language over arbitrary finite sequences; Lean over arbitrary Lists. Equivalent formalization.
- Content: Inverse of a product equals product of inverses in reverse order. Matches exactly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement (proof omitted) is given. The presence of `sorry` in the proof does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

- `def q : Polynomial F := X ^ 3 + C (2 : F)`: Defines q(x) in F[x] as x^3 + 2.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_5_23 : Irreducible (p : Polynomial F) ∧ Irreducible (q : Polynomial F) ∧ Nonempty (RingEquiv (Polynomial F ⧸ Ideal.span ({p} : Set (Polynomial F))) (Polynomial F ⧸ Ideal.span ({q} : Set (Polynomial F)))) := by sorry`:
  States that p is irreducible over F, q is irreducible over F, and there exists a ring isomorphism between the quotient rings F[x]/(p) and F[x]/(q). Using `RingEquiv` inside `Nonempty` expresses existence of an isomorphism. The quotient notation `Polynomial F ⧸ Ideal.span {p}` denotes F[x]/(p).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that over F = Z_7, both p(x) = x^3 − 2 and q(x) = x^3 + 2 are irreducible in F[x], and that the fields F[x]/(p(x)) and F[x]/(q(x)) are isomorphic.
- The Lean statement asserts exactly the irreducibility of p and q.
- It then asserts the existence of a ring isomorphism between the quotients F[x]/(p) and F[x]/(q). Since irreducible over a field implies the quotients are fields, a ring isomorphism here is the same as a field isomorphism. Thus it matches the “fields are isomorphic” part.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Definitions of F, p, q match exactly the intended objects.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; all are standard Mathlib constructs.
- The isomorphism is expressed as `Nonempty (RingEquiv ...)`, which faithfully captures “are isomorphic”.
- The original says “fields F[x]/(p) and F[x]/(q) are isomorphic.” The Lean code states a ring isomorphism between the quotients; given irreducibility, these quotients are fields, so this is equivalent. No mismatch.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: Deduce that |ab| = |ba| for all a, b in G, where |x| denotes the order of x. In Lean, `orderOf` is the order of an element (with the convention that 0 denotes infinite order). The theorem asserts exactly `orderOf (a * b) = orderOf (b * a)` for all a, b in a group G. This matches the mathematical content precisely.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. The Lean code makes no extra assumptions and introduces no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The slight technicality that orderOf returns a Nat with 0 meaning infinite order is standard and faithful to the intent of |x|. Hence, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Finset BigOperators`: bring in Mathlib and notation for finite sets and products.
- `variable {K : Type*} [Field K] [Fintype K] [DecidableEq K]`: K is a type equipped with a field structure, is finite (Fintype), and has decidable equality (needed for Finset operations). This matches the notion of a finite field.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Artin_exercise_13_6_10 : Finset.prod (Finset.univ.erase (0 : K)) (fun x => x) = -1 := by sorry`
  • `Finset.univ` is the finite set of all elements of K, and `erase (0 : K)` removes 0, so we are left with the finset of all nonzero elements of K.
  • `Finset.prod ... (fun x => x)` is the product over that finset of the identity function, i.e., the product of all nonzero elements of K.
  • The right-hand side `-1` is the additive inverse of 1 in the field K, i.e., the element −1 in K.
  Thus the statement says: the product of all nonzero elements of K equals −1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: ""Let K be a finite field. Prove that the product of the nonzero elements of K is −1."" The Lean statement assumes K is a finite field (Field + Fintype) and asserts exactly that the product over all nonzero elements equals −1. This is a direct and faithful formalization. The auxiliary `[DecidableEq K]` is a technical requirement for Finset and does not alter the meaning.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a (placeholder) proof.
- The finset used, `univ.erase 0`, indeed represents the set of nonzero elements.
- No change in generality or specialization compared to the original statement.
Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the Mathlib library; no mathematical content added.
- `open Polynomial`: Opens the Polynomial namespace to use notations like `X` (the polynomial variable) and `C` (the constant-coefficient embedding).
- `theorem artin_exercise_11_4_6c : Irreducible (X ^ 3 - C (9 : ZMod 31)) := by sorry`: States the theorem that the polynomial `X^3 - C(9)` with coefficients in `ZMod 31` is irreducible. Here, `ZMod 31` is the ring of integers modulo 31 (a field since 31 is prime), `X` is the indeterminate of `Polynomial (ZMod 31)`, and `C` embeds the constant `9` into the polynomial ring. Thus this is exactly the statement that `x^3 - 9` is irreducible over `F_31`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks to prove that `x^3 - 9` is irreducible in `F_{31}`. The Lean statement asserts `Irreducible (X ^ 3 - C (9 : ZMod 31))`, i.e., irreducible in `Polynomial (ZMod 31)`. Since `ZMod 31` is (canonically) the finite field `F_{31}`, this is precisely the same claim.

3) Final check:
- Coefficient field: `F_{31}` vs `ZMod 31` — identical in this context (31 prime).
- Polynomial: `x^3 - 9` vs `X^3 - C 9` — identical, with `C` the standard coercion of constants into polynomials.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; just the theorem statement with `sorry` as placeholder proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
Therefore, the code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: Let G be a group.

  Translation: For subgroups H and K of G, assume H and K are finite (witnessed by the instances `[Fintype H]` and `[Fintype K]`), and their orders (cardinalities) are coprime (`Nat.Coprime (Fintype.card H) (Fintype.card K)`). Then the meet `H ⊓ K` in the lattice of subgroups, which is the intersection H ∩ K, is equal to `⊥`, the trivial subgroup. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but that doesn't affect the statement.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The natural language says: If H and K are finite subgroups of G whose orders are relatively prime then H ∩ K = 1 (the trivial subgroup).
- In Lean, `H ⊓ K` is the subgroup intersection, and `⊥` is the trivial subgroup. The hypotheses exactly capture that H and K are finite and their orders are coprime. This matches the statement precisely.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code directly states the theorem.
- The only notational difference is that Lean uses `⊓` for intersection in the lattice of subgroups and `⊥` for the trivial subgroup, whereas the natural language uses `∩` and `1`. These are standard correspondences. There is no change in meaning or generality.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., finiteness of G) are imposed; only H and K are required to be finite, as in the original.

- `↔`: The two statements are equivalent.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; this doesn't affect the statement being a faithful translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: “Prove that A × B is an abelian group if and only if both A and B are abelian.” The Lean statement, under the assumptions that G and H are groups, asserts that the product group’s multiplication is commutative iff each factor’s multiplication is commutative. Since [Group (G × H)] is an instance derived from [Group G] and [Group H] in Mathlib, the left side indeed states that G × H is abelian. The right side states G and H are abelian. Thus the formal statement matches the natural language claim.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- The theorem precisely captures the equivalence stated, using commutativity of the group law as the meaning of “abelian.”
- The presence of [Group G] and [Group H] ensures the group structure context required by the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: H is an additive subgroup of ℚ, and for every nonzero x in H, 1/x ∈ H; prove H = 0 or ℚ.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: H is `AddSubgroup ℚ`, the property is encoded as `x ∈ H → x ≠ 0 → x⁻¹ ∈ H` (equivalent to “for every nonzero element x of H, 1/x ∈ H”), and the conclusion is `H = ⊥ ∨ H = ⊤` (i.e., H = {0} or H = ℚ).

  This declares (without providing a proof/object) a specific multiplicative equivalence between the product groups A × B and B × A, under the assumptions that A and B are groups. In Lean, `MulEquiv (A × B) (B × A)` is precisely a group isomorphism between the two product groups.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement asserts: for groups A and B, A × B ≅ B × A. The Lean statement exactly captures this by producing a `MulEquiv` between `(A × B)` and `(B × A)` under `[Group A] [Group B]`. This is a standard and faithful formalization of “≅” as group isomorphism in Mathlib.
- The use of `def ... : MulEquiv ...` is even slightly stronger (it posits a specific isomorphism, not just existence), which is acceptable and faithful to the mathematical intent.
- There are no auxiliary fake definitions. The `sorry` only omits the construction/proof, which is permitted per the instructions as we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is Fermat's Little Theorem: for prime `p`, `a^p ≡ a (mod p)` for all integers `a`.
- The Lean statement translates this exactly into equality in `ZMod p`: `(a : ZMod p) ^ p = (a : ZMod p)`, which is equivalent to `a^p ≡ a (mod p)`.
- Quantification matches: `p` is a natural number with `Nat.Prime p`, and `a` ranges over all integers `ℤ`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just the theorem statement. Proof method (via Lagrange's theorem) is not encoded, but the task here is to check statement faithfulness, not the method of proof.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is that the code expresses congruence modulo `p` as equality in `ZMod p`, which is standard and equivalent.
- The directive to use Lagrange's Theorem concerns the proof technique and is not part of the formal statement. Since the task is to match the theorem's content, this is acceptable.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_6_23 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (σ : G ≃* G)` introduces a finite group `G` (`[Group G]` and `[Fintype G]`) and an automorphism `σ` of `G` (`σ : G ≃* G` is a multiplicative equivalence from `G` to `G`, i.e., a group automorphism).
- `(h2 : σ.trans σ = MulEquiv.refl G)` states that the composition of `σ` with itself equals the identity automorphism. This is exactly the condition σ² = id_G.

Natural language: Let `G` be a finite group with an automorphism `σ` such that `σ(g) = g` iff `g = 1`. If `σ^2` is the identity map on `G`, prove that `G` is abelian.
The Lean statement matches exactly:

- Only fixed point is identity: `∀ g, σ g = g ↔ g = 1`.
- Involution: `σ.trans σ = MulEquiv.refl G` (σ² = id).
- Conclusion: `∀ a b, a * b = b * a`.

Step 3: Final check and discrepancies
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms used are standard Mathlib concepts.
- The composition notation `trans` is standard for composing equivalences; equating it to `MulEquiv.refl G` is exactly σ² = id.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem exists_maximal_subgroup_of_finite {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G] {H : Subgroup G}`: Let G be a finite group (a type with a Group structure and a Fintype instance), and H a subgroup of G.
- `(hproper : H ≠ (⊤ : Subgroup G))`:
  Hypothesis: H is a proper subgroup of G (i.e., H is not the whole group; ⊤ denotes the full subgroup G).
- `∃ M : Subgroup G, H ≤ M ∧ M ≠ (⊤ : Subgroup G) ∧ ∀ K : Subgroup G, M ≤ K → (K = M ∨ K = (⊤ : Subgroup G))`:
  Conclusion: There exists a subgroup M of G such that:
  - H ≤ M (H is contained in M),
  - M ≠ ⊤ (M is a proper subgroup), and
  - For every subgroup K of G with M ≤ K, we have K = M or K = ⊤. This is exactly the defining property that M is a maximal proper subgroup of G.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural statement defines a maximal subgroup as a proper subgroup M such that the only subgroups of G containing M are M and G. The theorem then claims that for a finite group G and a proper subgroup H, there exists a maximal subgroup containing H. The Lean theorem states precisely this: given finite G and proper H (H ≠ ⊤), there exists M with H ≤ M which is proper and maximal under inclusion among subgroups (the quantifier over K with M ≤ K implies K = M or K = ⊤). This matches the definition and the existence claim.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts come from Mathlib (Subgroup, ⊤, ≤, etc.).
- The property characterizing maximality is stated explicitly and matches the natural language definition.
- The finiteness assumption `[Fintype G]` matches “finite group G”.
- The hypothesis `H ≠ ⊤` matches “H is a proper subgroup of G”.
- The conclusion asserts existence of a maximal subgroup containing H, exactly as required.
There are no discrepancies or changes in meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_3_8 : Infinite (Equiv.Perm ℕ) := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, which contains the standard definitions for permutations and infinitude.
- Comment explains the intention: formalize ""If Ω = {1,2,3,...} then S_Ω is an infinite group"" as: the type of permutations of ℕ is infinite.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_3_8 : Infinite (Equiv.Perm ℕ) := by sorry`: States that the type of permutations (bijective self-equivalences) of ℕ is infinite. `Equiv.Perm ℕ` denotes the symmetric group on ℕ; `Infinite` is the standard predicate that a type has infinitely many elements. The proof is omitted, which is acceptable for our task.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement claims the symmetric group on Ω = {1,2,3,...} is infinite. In Lean, `Equiv.Perm ℕ` is the type of permutations on ℕ; this type carries a group structure by default. The property being asserted is that there are infinitely many such permutations, i.e., the underlying set is infinite. This matches the intended mathematical content: S_Ω is an infinite group. The only slight formalization choice is using ℕ (which in Lean includes 0) instead of the positive integers {1,2,3,...}. Since ℕ and the positive integers are in bijection, the symmetric groups on them have the same cardinality behavior (both infinite). For the purpose of proving infinitude, this is a benign and standard formalization.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Original: Ω = {1,2,3,...}; conclusion: S_Ω is infinite.
- Lean: `Infinite (Equiv.Perm ℕ)`.
Difference: ℕ in Lean includes 0, while Ω starts at 1. This does not affect the property of being infinite and is an accepted formalization. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement directly encodes the claim. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation: There is no Lean 4 code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""), so there are no lines to translate or interpret. Consequently, there is nothing to map to natural language.

2) Whole translation faithfulness: Since no compiling Lean code is available, there is no formal statement to compare against the natural language statement. Therefore, the translation cannot be faithful.

3) Final check: The mathematical statement to be formalized is: If H has finite index n in G, then there exists a normal subgroup K of G with K ≤ H and |G : K| ≤ n!. With no code present, there is no theorem, no definitions, and no auxiliary content to verify. Hence, the two problems (natural language vs. code) are not comparable; the translation fails by absence.

Given the lack of any Lean code, this is not a legitimate or faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, which contains definitions for groups, finite types, cardinalities, and simplicity of groups.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_23 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 462) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  - This declares a theorem for an arbitrary type `G` with a group structure `[Group G]` and a finiteness structure `[Fintype G]`.
  - The hypothesis `h : Fintype.card G = 462` states that the order of the group `G` is 462.
  - The conclusion `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` states that `G` is not a simple group.
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable here since we are only auditing the statement’s faithfulness to the natural language.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that if |G|=462 then G is not simple."" This presupposes `G` is finite (since it has a finite order) and concludes it is not simple.
- The Lean statement precisely matches: it assumes `G` is a finite group with `Fintype.card G = 462` and concludes `¬ IsSimpleGroup G`.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement is given.
- Any technical additions (like `[Fintype G]`) are necessary to express `|G|` in Lean and do not change the meaning.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical content. No discrepancies or changes in generality.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.

  This states: Let G be a type with a commutative group structure (i.e., an abelian group) and finite (Fintype G). Let n be a natural number such that n divides the order of G (hn) and n is positive (hnpos). Then there exists a subgroup H of G and an instance showing H is finite (hH), such that the cardinality of H equals n.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For a finite abelian group G and each positive divisor n of |G|, there exists a subgroup of order n.
- The Lean theorem exactly encodes: if G is a finite abelian group ([CommGroup G], [Fintype G]) and n is a positive divisor of |G| (hn, hnpos), then there exists a subgroup H with |H| = n. The extra existential `hH : Fintype H` is a standard technicality—any subgroup of a finite group is finite—so it does not alter the mathematical content.
- It does not mention the proof method (Cauchy's theorem and induction), but the task is to check the statement translation, not the proof.

3) Final check:
- Objects match: finite abelian group ↔ `[CommGroup G] [Fintype G]`.
- Condition on n matches: positive divisor ↔ `hn : n ∣ Fintype.card G`, `hnpos : 0 < n`.
- Conclusion matches: existence of subgroup of order n ↔ `∃ H : Subgroup G, Fintype.card H = n` (with an included `hH : Fintype H`, which is harmless and automatic from `[Fintype G]`).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement. The use of `sorry` is acceptable here since we're auditing translation, not proof.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- theorem IsSolvable.of_surjective {G H : Type*} [Group G] [Group H] (f : MonoidHom G H) (hf : Function.Surjective f) : IsSolvable G → IsSolvable H := by sorry
  Natural language: For groups G and H, given a surjective homomorphism f: G → H, if G is solvable then H is solvable. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise and uses standard Mathlib notions: MonoidHom for group homomorphisms, Function.Surjective, and IsSolvable.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to prove: ""quotient groups of a solvable group are solvable.""
- The Lean statement is a slightly stronger generalization: solvability descends along any surjective homomorphism. Quotients are obtained by the canonical projection G → G/N, which is surjective, so the original statement follows immediately as a corollary. This is a standard and faithful way to formalize the claim.

3) Final check of differences:
- Difference: The code proves a more general result (surjective image of a solvable group is solvable), rather than only quotients. This is a benign and standard generalization that implies the desired statement.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib. There are no vacuous placeholders. The proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing since we are checking the statement, not its proof.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_19 (G : Type _) [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 6545) : ¬IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  This declares: For any type G with a group structure and a finite cardinality, if the order of G (the cardinality of its underlying set) is 6545, then G is not a simple group. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; we only evaluate the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: “Prove that if |G| = 6545 then G is not simple.” The Lean statement precisely matches this: it assumes G is a finite group with `Fintype.card G = 6545` and concludes `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` (G is not simple). Mathlib’s `IsSimpleGroup G` is the standard notion of a simple group. The presence of `[Fintype G]` aligns with the finite order assumption; `|G|` is rendered as `Fintype.card G`.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No extra or missing hypotheses are present.
- The statement quantifies over all finite groups G of order 6545 and concludes not simple, exactly as in the natural language. Therefore, the two statements are the same.

  Natural language: For a natural number p that is prime and not equal to 2 (i.e., an odd prime), the number of units in ZMod p that are squares (i.e., the number of nonzero residue classes modulo p that are quadratic residues) is (p − 1)/2.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_4_4_9_nonresidues_count {p : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hp2 : p ≠ 2) : Fintype.card { a : (ZMod p)ˣ // ¬ IsSquare (a : ZMod p) } = (p - 1) / 2 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For the same p, the number of units in ZMod p that are not squares (i.e., the quadratic nonresidues among the nonzero classes) is also (p − 1)/2.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: “Show that (p − 1)/2 of the numbers 1, 2, ..., p − 1 are quadratic residues and (p − 1)/2 are quadratic nonresidues mod p.”
- The Lean statements count elements of `(ZMod p)ˣ` (the units), which are exactly the nonzero residue classes mod p, i.e., the classes represented by 1,2,…,p−1. Using `IsSquare (a : ZMod p)` captures the definition of a quadratic residue mod p. Excluding 0 is handled by using units. The condition `p ≠ 2` is appropriate (for p = 2 the statement would fail), and `Nat.Prime p` matches the intended setting. The two theorems split the residue and nonresidue counts, exactly mirroring the natural language claim.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only theorem statements (with `sorry` proofs) are given, which is acceptable per the instructions.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- Yes. The Lean code asserts that among the nonzero classes modulo an odd prime p (equivalently, among 1..p−1), exactly (p−1)/2 are quadratic residues and (p−1)/2 are nonresidues. This is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original: For a commutative ring with `1 ≠ 0`, if `a` is nilpotent then for all `b ∈ R`, `1 - ab` is a unit.
- The Lean theorem has exactly these hypotheses and conclusion. The universal quantification over `b` is captured by having `b : R` as a free parameter with no extra assumptions; thus the statement holds for arbitrary `b`.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Polynomial` opens the `Polynomial` namespace so we can use `C` etc. conveniently.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]` sets up a general commutative ring R.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_2_2 (p : R[X]) : (∃ q : R[X], q ≠ 0 ∧ p * q = 0) ↔ (∃ b : R, b ≠ 0 ∧ Polynomial.C b * p = 0) := by sorry`
  This states: For any polynomial `p` over `R`, `p` is a zero divisor in `R[X]` (i.e., there exists a nonzero polynomial `q` with `p*q = 0`) if and only if there exists a nonzero element `b ∈ R` such that `C b * p = 0` in `R[X]`. Here `Polynomial.C : R →+* R[X]` is the canonical embedding of coefficients as constant polynomials, so `C b * p` is exactly the polynomial product corresponding to multiplying `p(x)` by the scalar `b` in the natural-language sense.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: For `p(x)` in `R[x]`, `p(x)` is a zero divisor in `R[x]` iff there exists a nonzero `b ∈ R` with `b p(x) = 0`.
- The Lean statement’s left-hand side `(∃ q : R[X], q ≠ 0 ∧ p * q = 0)` precisely formalizes “`p(x)` is a zero divisor in `R[x]`.” The right-hand side `(∃ b : R, b ≠ 0 ∧ Polynomial.C b * p = 0)` formalizes “there exists nonzero `b ∈ R` such that `b p(x) = 0`,” with `Polynomial.C b` representing the constant polynomial `b`.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. The Lean code uses standard Mathlib constructs without any vacuous placeholders. The assumption `[CommRing R]` is a mild specialization relative to the informal statement and is entirely standard for polynomials; it does not change the meaning. No auxiliary definitions are introduced. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""Let φ: R → S be a surjective homomorphism of rings. Prove that the image of the center of R is contained in the center of S."" The Lean theorem exactly encodes this: φ is a ring homomorphism (`R →+* S`), assumed surjective, and the conclusion is `φ '' (center R) ⊆ center S`. The defined center matches the usual multiplicative commutation condition. No extraneous hypotheses are added.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses unital ring homomorphisms (`→+*`), which is the standard convention in Mathlib and commonly in algebra; the natural language statement is typically interpreted the same way. This is an acceptable, standard interpretation.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_2c : Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1 : Polynomial ℤ) := by sorry`:
  This declares a theorem stating that the polynomial with integer coefficients `X^4 + 4 X^3 + 6 X^2 + 2 X + 1` is irreducible in `Polynomial ℤ` (i.e., in ℤ[x]). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear and precise.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement asks to prove that `x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x + 1` is irreducible in ℤ[x]. The Lean statement asserts exactly that, using Mathlib's `Irreducible` predicate on the polynomial `X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1` over `Polynomial ℤ`. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The variable and coefficient ring match the intended setting.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same: both claim irreducibility of the specific polynomial over the integers. No differences in generality or meaning. The code is a faithful translation of the problem statement (even though the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, the standard mathematics library for Lean.
- Comment explains the exercise: there is no rational number whose square is 12.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_2 : ¬ ∃ q : ℚ, q ^ 2 = (12 : ℚ) := by sorry` states the theorem: it is not the case that there exists a rational number q such that q squared equals 12. The `(12 : ℚ)` is just the rational number 12, and `q ^ 2` is the square of q.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: “There is no rational number whose square is 12” translates to `¬ ∃ q : ℚ, q^2 = 12`. Casting 12 to ℚ is standard and faithful.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary definitions or vacuous placeholders. The use of `sorry` is only in the proof, which is acceptable for the purpose of translation checking. No discrepancies found.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Load Mathlib and open the Set namespace; no mathematical content changes.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{G : Type*} [Group G]`: G is a group.
  - `{p α : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hα : 0 < α)`: p is a prime natural number and α is a positive natural number.
  - `[Fintype G] (hcard : Fintype.card G = p ^ α)`: G is finite with order |G| = p^α.
  - `(H : Subgroup G) (hindex : H.index = p)`: H is a subgroup of G with index [G : H] = p.
  - Conclusion: `∀ g : G, (fun x => g * x * g⁻¹) '' (H : Set G) = (H : Set G)`: For every g in G, the image of H under the conjugation map x ↦ g x g⁻¹ equals the set underlying H. This says g H g⁻¹ = H for all g, i.e., H is normal in G.

2) Assessing faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If G has order p^α (with α > 0) and p is prime, then every subgroup of index p is normal in G.
- The Lean statement precisely assumes G is finite of order p^α with p prime and α > 0, takes an arbitrary subgroup H of index p, and concludes that for all g, gHg⁻¹ = H as sets, which is exactly the definition of normality. The formulation via set equality under conjugation is a standard equivalent characterization of normal subgroups.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced. All terms are standard Mathlib objects (Group, Subgroup, index, Fintype.card, Set.image, etc.).

3) Final comparison:
- Hypotheses match: p prime, |G| = p^α with α positive, and H a subgroup of index p.
- Conclusion matches: H is normal in G, expressed as invariance under conjugation for all g.
- No extra or missing constraints; the slight strengthening to equality of sets is exactly equivalent to normality.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_1_2 {R : Type _} [Monoid R] [HasDistribNeg R] {u : R} (h : IsUnit u) : IsUnit (-u) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R equipped with a monoid structure and a negation that distributes over multiplication, if u is a unit in R, then −u is also a unit.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: “Prove that if u is a unit in R then so is −u.” This is usually stated for rings, but the essential content is that in a multiplicative structure with a negation, taking negation preserves units.
- The Lean statement assumes [Monoid R] (so that IsUnit makes sense) and [HasDistribNeg R] (so negation works compatibly with multiplication). This is a slight generalization from “ring” to “monoid with a suitably compatible negation,” which still includes the ring case. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
- The Lean theorem exactly asserts the intended implication: from IsUnit u to IsUnit (−u). The added typeclass assumptions are standard and legitimate; they do not weaken the statement relative to the typical ring context, but rather generalize it in a natural way. No red flags such as placeholder definitions appear.
- Therefore, the formal statement is a faithful translation (indeed, a reasonable generalization) of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- There is no Lean 4 code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""). Therefore, there are no lines to translate.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- Since there is no code, there is no formal statement to compare against the natural language statement: ""Prove that if |G|=105 then G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 7-subgroup."" Consequently, the translation cannot be faithful.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
- The natural language problem is about group theory and normal Sylow subgroups when |G| = 105.
- There is no corresponding Lean statement. Hence, they are not the same; the code is missing entirely.

Conclusion: The submission fails because there is no code to evaluate. This cannot constitute a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in Mathlib.
- `open Subgroup` opens the Subgroup namespace for convenience.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] (x : G) (n : ℕ)` sets up a general group G, an element x, and a natural number n.
- `def IsMaximalSubgroup ...` defines: a subgroup H is maximal if H ≠ ⊤ and for every subgroup K with H ≤ K, one has K = H or K = ⊤. This is the standard notion of a maximal proper subgroup in the subgroup lattice of G.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_2_4_16c` assumes:
  • `hn : orderOf x = n` (x has order n),
  • `hcyc : Subgroup.closure ({x} : Set G) = ⊤` (G is generated by x, i.e., G is cyclic generated by x),
  • `hnpos : 1 ≤ n` (n ≥ 1),
  and concludes: for every subgroup H of G, `IsMaximalSubgroup H` iff there exists a natural number p such that p is prime, p divides n, and `H = Subgroup.closure ({x ^ p} : Set G)` (i.e., H is generated by x^p).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If G = ⟨x⟩ is cyclic of order n ≥ 1, then a subgroup H is maximal iff H = ⟨x^p⟩ for some prime p | n.
- The Lean hypotheses `orderOf x = n` and `closure {x} = ⊤` together express exactly that G is cyclic generated by x and that x has finite order n. The condition `1 ≤ n` matches “n ≥ 1”.
- The conclusion quantifies over all subgroups H and gives the equivalence with existence of a prime p dividing n such that H is generated by x^p, exactly mirroring the statement.
- The use of `Subgroup.closure ({x^p})` faithfully represents ⟨x^p⟩. The definition of maximal subgroup is standard and faithful.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or fake definitions: `IsMaximalSubgroup` is a legitimate definition. No placeholders.
- The theorem’s quantifiers and content match the original statement. The slight formalization details (explicitly stating generation by x via closure = ⊤ and orderOf x = n) are faithful to “G = ⟨x⟩ of order n ≥ 1”.
- Edge case n = 1 is correctly handled: there are no maximal subgroups and no primes dividing 1, so the equivalence holds vacuously for every H, as expected.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: If r is rational (r ≠ 0) and x is irrational, prove that r + x is irrational. The Lean statement exactly encodes this: r, x are real; r is rational (expressed via existence of a rational q with r = q as a real), r ≠ 0, x is irrational; conclude r + x is irrational. The use of `Rat` instead of `ℚ` is standard (ℚ is notation for Rat), so this is faithful.

The `Complex.ofReal r` is the canonical embedding of a real number into the complex numbers, so this is exactly the product `r w` in ℂ. `Complex.abs w` is the usual modulus `|w|`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language: “If z is a complex number, prove that there exists an r ≥ 0 and a complex number w with |w| = 1 such that z = r w.” The Lean statement quantifies over `z : ℂ` and asserts the existence of `r : ℝ` with `0 ≤ r`, `w : ℂ` with `Complex.abs w = 1`, and the equation `z = (Complex.ofReal r) * w`. This directly matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check:
- Domain/codomain: `z : ℂ` matches.
- Existence of `r ≥ 0`: `r : ℝ` and `0 ≤ r` matches.
- `w : ℂ` with modulus 1: `Complex.abs w = 1` matches `|w| = 1`.
- Equation: `z = (Complex.ofReal r) * w` is exactly `z = r w` in ℂ.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_1_22a {G : Type _} [Group G] {H K : Subgroup G}`: We have a group G and subgroups H and K of G.
- Hypotheses `hH : ∀ (g x : G), x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H` and `hK : ∀ (g x : G), x ∈ K → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ K`: These assert that H and K are invariant under conjugation by any element g ∈ G; i.e., H and K are normal subgroups of G (this is a standard characterization of normality).
- Conclusion `∀ (g x : G), x ∈ H ∧ x ∈ K → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H ∧ g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ K`: If x lies in both H and K, then its conjugate by any g also lies in both H and K. In other words, the intersection set H ∩ K is stable under conjugation by any g.

2) Faithfulness comparison:
- The natural language statement: If H and K are normal subgroups of G, then H ∩ K is a normal subgroup of G.
- The Lean statement assumes the normality of H and K via the conjugation-closure property and concludes that any element of H ∩ K is taken by conjugation into H ∩ K. Since H ∩ K is known (in Mathlib and in standard algebra) to be a subgroup of G (as the intersection of subgroups), this closure under conjugation is exactly the condition needed to conclude normality of H ∩ K. So the key mathematical content is captured.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code formulates normality via elementwise conjugation closure rather than using the Mathlib predicate `Subgroup.Normal`. It also states the conclusion at the element level (`x ∈ H ∧ x ∈ K → ... ∈ H ∧ ... ∈ K`) rather than explicitly asserting `Normal (H ⊓ K)`. This is mathematically equivalent to the normality of the intersection because H ∩ K is a subgroup. Thus the translation is essentially faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement with standard group-theoretic content. The presence of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable for this auditing task, which cares about the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The code is an accurate, essentially faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with a minor difference in packaging (elementwise property vs. `Subgroup.Normal`).

- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- Comment explains intent: prove existence of a normal Sylow p-subgroup for a group of order 351, and states they will assert a stronger statement: existence of a unique (hence normal) subgroup of order 13.
- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_15` takes a type `G` with a group structure and finiteness, and a hypothesis that `Nat.card G = 351`. It concludes: there exists a subgroup `K` of `G` with `Nat.card K = 13` such that for every subgroup `H` with `Nat.card H = 13`, we have `H = K`. In words, there is exactly one subgroup of order 13 in `G`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- In a group of order 351 = 27 · 13, a subgroup of order 13 is precisely a Sylow 13-subgroup. The statement that there is a unique subgroup of order 13 implies there is a unique Sylow 13-subgroup, which is therefore normal. This directly implies the original statement that there exists a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing the order (specifically p = 13).
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Group, Finite, Subgroup, Nat.card) with no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per instructions since we are judging the statement.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean statement is a strengthening/specialization of the natural language statement: it specifies p = 13 and asserts uniqueness of the Sylow 13-subgroup (hence normal), rather than merely existence of a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some p. This is acceptable and faithful, since it implies the original claim.
- No discrepancies or red flags in formalization; no placeholder or vacuous definitions.

Conclusion: The formal statement is a faithful and slightly stronger translation of the original statement.

The summation `∑ i, x i * y i` over `i : Fin k` is the standard dot product in coordinates.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement: If k ≥ 2 and x ∈ ℝ^k, there exists y ∈ ℝ^k with y ≠ 0 and x · y = 0. The Lean statement matches this exactly: it assumes k ≥ 2, takes x in ℝ^k, and asserts the existence of a nonzero y with zero dot product (expressed as the coordinate sum). Representing ℝ^k as `Fin k → ℝ` and using `∑ i, x i * y i` for the dot product is standard and faithful.

- Dot product: written as a finite sum rather than a dedicated `dot` operator—equivalent in this context.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_8_2_4 {R : Type _} [CommRing R] [IsDomain R]` introduces a type R equipped with a commutative ring structure and the property that it is an integral domain.
- Hypothesis `h1`: `∀ (a b : R), a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → ∃ (d r s : R), d ∣ a ∧ d ∣ b ∧ (∀ c, c ∣ a → c ∣ b → c ∣ d) ∧ d = r * a + s * b`.
  Natural language: For any nonzero a, b in R, there exists an element d and coefficients r, s in R such that (i) d divides a and b; (ii) any common divisor c of a and b divides d (so d is a greatest common divisor up to associates in the divisibility order); and (iii) d is a linear combination ra + sb. This exactly matches condition (i).
- Hypothesis `h2`: `∀ (a : ℕ → R), (∀ i, a (i+1) ∣ a i) → ∃ N, ∀ n, n ≥ N → ∃ (u : Rˣ), a n = (u : R) * a N`.
  Natural language: For any sequence a₀, a₁, a₂, ... in R such that a_{i+1} divides a_i for all i, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, a_n is associate to a_N (i.e., a_n = u • a_N for some unit u). This encodes stabilization up to units of a divisibility chain. Note: the code does not assume the a_i are nonzero.
- Conclusion: `IsPrincipalIdealRing R` asserts that every ideal of R is principal. Combined with `[IsDomain R]`, this corresponds to R being a Principal Ideal Domain in the usual sense.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Condition (i) is encoded faithfully: gcd of two nonzero elements exists and is a linear combination.
- Condition (ii) in the original requires the a_i to be nonzero. The Lean hypothesis h2 omits this nonzero requirement and demands stabilization for all divisibility chains, including those with zero terms. This is a stronger hypothesis than the original. The conclusion matches the intended one (R is a PID via IsPrincipalIdealRing together with IsDomain).

3) Final comparison:
- The only discrepancy is that h2 in Lean is stronger (no nonzero assumption). This is a slight specialization/strengthening of the hypothesis compared to the natural language condition. There are no vacuous definitions, and the statement uses standard Mathlib notions. Thus, the translation is essentially faithful, albeit slightly stronger on (ii).

Given the small discrepancy, this merits a high score but not a perfect one.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_3_3_3 {G : Type*} [Group G] (p : ℕ) (hp : Fact (Nat.Prime p))`:
  We have a group G, a natural number p which is prime.
- `{H : Subgroup G} (hHnormal : ∀ g : G, g * (H : Set G) = (H : Set G) * g)`:
  H is a subgroup of G and satisfies that for every g in G, the left coset gH equals the right coset Hg. This is a characterization of H being normal in G.
- `(hHindex : H.index = p)`:
  The index of H in G is p.
- `: ∀ K : Subgroup G, K ≤ H ∨ (H ⊔ K = (⊤ : Subgroup G) ∧ K.index = p)`:
  For every subgroup K of G, either K is contained in H, or the join (sup) of H and K equals the whole group (top subgroup), and the index of K in G is p.
- `by sorry`:
  Proof omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: If H is a normal subgroup of G of prime index p, then for all subgroups K ≤ G, either K ≤ H, or G = H K and |K : K ∩ H| = p.

Matching parts:
- H normal and index p: The code has normality via coset equality and H.index = p with p prime. This matches the setup.
- The disjunction: either K ≤ H, or G = HK and |K : K ∩ H| = p.
  The code's second clause says H ⊔ K = ⊤ (which, when H is normal, is equivalent to HK being a subgroup that generates all of G), so the G = HK part is essentially captured by H ⊔ K = ⊤.

Mismatch:
- The crucial index in the second clause. The natural language requires |K : K ∩ H| = p, i.e., the index of K ∩ H in K. The code instead asserts K.index = p, i.e., the index of K in G equals p. These are different quantities. In general, from [G : H] = p and G = HK one deduces [K : K ∩ H] = p, not [G : K] = p. The latter is a much stronger and typically false claim.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are not the same. The code replaces |K : K ∩ H| = p with K.index = p (i.e., [G : K] = p). This is a significant change in meaning, not a minor technicality. The rest is reasonably aligned (normality, prime index, the join equaling top corresponding to HK = G when H is normal), but the index condition is incorrect.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are made; the issue is the incorrect target statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the wrong index in the second alternative.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Brings in Mathlib and opens the Set namespace for set-theoretic notation.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_5 (A : Set ℝ) (hA : A.Nonempty) (h : BddBelow A) : sInf A = - sSup ((fun x => -x) '' A) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let A be a subset of the real numbers. Assume A is nonempty (hA) and bounded below (h). Then the infimum of A equals the negative of the supremum of the image of A under x ↦ −x, i.e., sInf A = − sSup ((fun x => −x) '' A). The set `((fun x => -x) '' A)` is precisely {−x | x ∈ A}, i.e., −A.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For a nonempty set A ⊆ ℝ that is bounded below, with −A = {−x | x ∈ A}, prove inf A = − sup(−A).
- The Lean statement uses sInf for infimum and sSup for supremum on ℝ, and represents −A as the image `((fun x => -x) '' A)`. The hypotheses `A.Nonempty` and `BddBelow A` match the conditions. Everything aligns exactly with the mathematical statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The code directly states the theorem with appropriate Mathlib notions.
- The only slight technicality is the use of `sInf` and `sSup` which are standard in Mathlib and match infimum and supremum. Also, the boundedness of −A follows from the bounded-below assumption on A, so there is no mismatch.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- Comment: States the exercise: as vector spaces over ℚ, ℝ^n is isomorphic to ℝ for all positive integers n; in Lean they phrase it for `n : ℕ` with `0 < n`.
- `noncomputable def Dummit_Foote_exercise_11_1_13 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) : (Fin n → ℝ) ≃ₗ[ℚ] ℝ := by sorry`
  This declares a (noncomputable) definition that, given a natural number `n` and a proof `hn` that `n > 0`, produces a linear equivalence over ℚ between `(Fin n → ℝ)` and `ℝ`. Here `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the standard Lean representation of ℝ^n (functions from an n-element type to ℝ with pointwise operations). The scalar field is explicitly ℚ via `≃ₗ[ℚ]`.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: ""Prove that as vector spaces over ℚ, ℝ^n ≅ ℝ, for all n ∈ ℤ⁺."" The Lean signature asserts exactly that: for every positive natural number `n`, there is a ℚ-linear equivalence between ℝ^n and ℝ. Using `(Fin n → ℝ)` for ℝ^n is standard and correct. The positivity condition `0 < n` matches `n ∈ ℤ⁺`. The scalar field is explicitly ℚ. The Lean statement even provides a definable equivalence for each such `n` (stronger than mere existence).

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
Yes. Both assert the existence of a ℚ-linear isomorphism between ℝ^n and ℝ for every positive integer n. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a `sorry` (omitted proof), but the task is to verify the translation, not the proof. No discrepancies in quantification or structures: `Fin n → ℝ` is ℝ^n, scalars are ℚ, and n is required to be positive.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use mathlib’s algebraic hierarchy.
- `theorem subring_of_field_is_domain {K : Type _} [Field K] (S : Subring K) (h1 : (1 : K) ∈ S) : IsDomain S := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type K with a field structure, and any subring S of K, if 1_K is in S, then S is an integral domain. The conclusion `IsDomain S` asserts that the ring structure on the subring S (as a type) is an integral domain.

Assessment:
- This matches the statement “Any subring of a field which contains the identity is an integral domain.” The hypothesis `h1 : (1 : K) ∈ S` explicitly encodes “contains the identity.” In mathlib, `Subring` already contains 1 by definition, so `h1` is redundant but harmless and still faithful to the intended natural language.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; just a single theorem with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions.
- The target property `IsDomain` is the standard formalization of “integral domain.”

Final check:
- The Lean statement and the natural language statement are essentially the same. The only minor technical redundancy is the explicit `h1`, which does not change the meaning. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The statement is a theorem named `Rudin_exercise_1_16a`.
- Parameters:
  - `k : ℕ` with hypothesis `hk : 3 ≤ k` corresponds to k ≥ 3.
  - `x y : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)` means x, y ∈ ℝ^k.
  - `d : ℝ` with `hd : dist x y = d` and `hdpos : 0 < d` corresponds to |x − y| = d > 0.
  - `r : ℝ` with `hr : 0 < r` corresponds to r > 0.
  - `h2r : 2 * r > d` corresponds to 2r > d.
- Conclusion: `Set.Infinite { z : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k) | dist z x = r ∧ dist z y = r }` says the set of z ∈ ℝ^k with dist(z,x) = r and dist(z,y) = r is infinite.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean formulation uses EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k) which is the standard ℝ^k. The distance `dist` is the Euclidean norm of differences, matching |·| in the natural language context.
- All given assumptions (k ≥ 3, |x − y| = d > 0, r > 0, and 2r > d) are present explicitly as hypotheses.
- The conclusion “there are infinitely many z …” is faithfully rendered as `Set.Infinite` of the set defined by the two distance equalities.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is provided (with an unproven `sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches exactly: same ambient space, same inequalities and equalities, and the same infinitude claim.
- No generalization or restriction beyond the original statement.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: Let s be a real sequence s : ℕ → ℝ and let a ∈ ℝ. Assume s_n → a as n → ∞ (encoded as `Filter.Tendsto s Filter.atTop (nhds a)`). Then the sequence of absolute values |s_n| converges to |a| as n → ∞ (encoded as `Filter.Tendsto (fun n => |s n|) Filter.atTop (nhds |a|)`). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that convergence of {s_n} implies convergence of {|s_n|}.""
- In standard real analysis context, this means: if s_n → a in ℝ, then |s_n| → |a| in ℝ. The Lean statement exactly captures this for real sequences, specifying the limit of |s_n| is |a|, which is the canonical strengthening of the claim.

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain: Both address real sequences. The Lean code explicitly uses ℝ, consistent with the typical setting (and with Rudin exercise 3.1a). No generalization beyond ℝ.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib. Fine.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: G is a type with a group structure.
- `variable (p : ℕ)`: p is a natural number (no assumption of primality).
- `open Subgroup`: Open the Subgroup namespace.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_33 (P H : Subgroup G) (hP_is_sylow : Prop) (hP_normal : Prop) : ∃! (Q : Subgroup G), True := by sorry`:
  This declares a theorem with inputs:
  - P, H: subgroups of G.
  - hP_is_sylow: an arbitrary proposition (intended to mean P is a Sylow p-subgroup, but here it is just a placeholder Prop with no content).
  - hP_normal: an arbitrary proposition (intended to mean P is normal, but again a placeholder Prop).
  And the conclusion is: there exists a unique subgroup Q of G such that True holds. Since True holds for every Q, this is asserting there is exactly one subgroup of G. This conclusion is independent of P, H, p, normality, or Sylow structure, and does not reference H or P ∩ H.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement says: If P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup of G and H ≤ G is any subgroup, then P ∩ H is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of H. To formalize this faithfully in Lean/Mathlib, one would need:
- An assumption that p is prime and G is finite (or otherwise that Sylow theory applies), e.g., `[Fintype G]` and `Fact p.Prime`, and the appropriate Mathlib notions of Sylow subgroups, e.g., `IsSylow (P : Subgroup G) p` or `P ∈ Sylow p G` (via the `Sylow p G` type), and `P.Normal` or `P ≤ ⊥`? rather, `P.Normal`.
- A conclusion about the intersection `P ⊓ H` (or `P ⊓ H` equals the unique Sylow p-subgroup of H), i.e., a uniqueness statement over Sylow p-subgroups of H.
The provided code does none of this: it replaces the key hypotheses with bare `Prop` placeholders and the conclusion is a vacuous uniqueness statement `∃! Q, True` that does not mention H, P ∩ H, or Sylow structure at all. Thus it is not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Missing and incorrect components:
  - No use of Mathlib's Sylow definitions; `hP_is_sylow : Prop` is a vacuous placeholder.
  - No normality predicate; `hP_normal : Prop` is a vacuous placeholder.
  - No assumptions of finiteness of G or primality of p.
  - Conclusion is unrelated: `∃! (Q : Subgroup G), True` is not about P ∩ H nor about Sylow subgroups of H.
Therefore the code is not a legitimate translation of the statement.

Grade justification: The code uses vacuous placeholders for core concepts and states a completely unrelated uniqueness claim. This is not a near miss; it is unrelated to the intended theorem. Hence a grade of 0.

- The theorem `Dummit_Foote_exercise_8_3_6b (q : ℕ) [hp : Fact (Nat.Prime q)] (hmod4 : q % 4 = 3)` introduces a natural number q, assumed to be prime (`Nat.Prime q`), and satisfying the congruence condition `q % 4 = 3` (i.e., q ≡ 3 mod 4).
- The conclusion is a conjunction:
  • `IsField (GaussianInt ⧸ Ideal.span ({(q : GaussianInt)} : Set GaussianInt))`: the quotient ring Z[i]/(q) is a field. Here, `GaussianInt` denotes Z[i], `(q : GaussianInt)` is the element q in Z[i], `Ideal.span ({(q : GaussianInt)} : Set GaussianInt)` is the principal ideal generated by q, and `⧸` denotes the quotient ring.
  • `∃ (inst : Fintype (GaussianInt ⧸ Ideal.span ({(q : GaussianInt)} : Set GaussianInt))), @Fintype.card ... inst = q ^ 2`: there exists a finiteness structure on the quotient making its cardinality equal to q^2. This is the formal way to say the quotient has exactly q^2 elements.
- `by sorry`: proof omitted; acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: for a prime integer q with q ≡ 3 mod 4, the quotient Z[i]/(q) is a field with q^2 elements.
- The Lean statement matches this precisely: it asserts the quotient is a field and has q^2 elements. The use of `Nat.Prime q` (q a natural prime) instead of “q ∈ ℤ prime” is a standard, harmless specialization to positive primes and matches the intent. The congruence is encoded via `q % 4 = 3`, which is exactly q ≡ 3 mod 4 in ℕ.
- The existence of a `Fintype` instance with cardinality q^2 formalizes “has q^2 elements.”

3) Final check for differences:
- ℤ vs ℕ: The code uses q : ℕ with `Nat.Prime q` rather than an integer prime. This is a standard formalization choice and aligns with the intended meaning (positive prime). No change in mathematical content.
- The expression of finiteness/cardinality via `∃ inst : Fintype, Fintype.card = q^2` is the usual Lean way to state “finite with q^2 elements.” No substantive difference.
- The ideal `(q)` is correctly represented as `Ideal.span {q : GaussianInt}`. The quotient ring is exactly Z[i]/(q).

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly matches the mathematical claim.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def f : Polynomial ℤ := X ^ 2 - C (2 : ℤ)` defines the polynomial f = X^2 − 2 over the integers.
- `def R := AdjoinRoot f` defines the ring R obtained by adjoining a root of f to ℤ; this is the abstract ring ℤ[α] where α satisfies α^2 = 2. This is canonically isomorphic to the usual ℤ[√2].
- `instance : CommRing R := AdjoinRoot.instCommRing f` provides the commutative ring structure on R (standard for AdjoinRoot).
- The theorem statement `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_9 : Irreducible (X ^ 2 - C (AdjoinRoot.root f) : Polynomial R)` asserts that in the polynomial ring R[X], the polynomial X^2 − C(AdjoinRoot.root f) is irreducible. Here `AdjoinRoot.root f` is the adjoined element α with α^2 = 2, i.e., the formal “√2” in R, and `C` embeds R into R[X] as constant polynomials. So the polynomial is exactly x^2 − √2 over the coefficient ring R = ℤ[√2] (up to the standard isomorphism).

Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement asks to prove that x^2 − √2 is irreducible over ℤ[√2]. The Lean statement proves irreducibility of X^2 − α over R = AdjoinRoot(X^2 − 2), where α is a root of X^2 − 2. This R is (canonically) isomorphic to ℤ[√2], and α corresponds to √2. Thus the Lean theorem precisely formalizes the intended statement.
- The remark “You may assume that ℤ[√2] is a U.F.D.” is a hint about the proof strategy, not part of the statement; its absence from the formal statement is appropriate.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all constructions (AdjoinRoot, polynomial irreducibility) are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]` and `variable {H K : Subgroup G}`: We work in a group G with subgroups H and K.
- The theorem statement takes three hypotheses:
  • `hHK : H ≤ K`: H is a subgroup of K. (This hypothesis is present but not used in the proof.)
  • `hchar : ∀ g : G, (∀ k : G, k ∈ K → g * k * g⁻¹ ∈ K) → (∀ h : G, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H)`: For every g in G, if conjugation by g maps K into itself, then conjugation by g maps H into itself. This encodes a “characteristic-like” property: H is stable under any conjugation that stabilizes K.
  • `hnormal : ∀ g : G, ∀ k : G, k ∈ K → g * k * g⁻¹ ∈ K`: K is normal in G (conjugation by any g sends K into K; the reverse inclusion comes by applying the same to g⁻¹, so equality holds overall).
- Conclusion: `∀ g : G, ∀ h : G, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H`: H is normal in G.
- Proof: Given g and h ∈ H, apply `hchar g` with the premise `hnormal g` to deduce `g h g⁻¹ ∈ H`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If H ≤ K, H is characteristic in K, and K is normal in G, then H is normal in G.
- Lean encoding:
  • K normal in G is accurately captured by `hnormal`.
  • The “H characteristic in K” part is represented by `hchar`, which asserts invariance of H under any conjugation by g that (at least) sends K into K. This is weaker than the full definition of “H characteristic in K” (which requires invariance under all automorphisms of K), but it is a sufficient consequence of characteristic for the conjugations in question, and together with normality (which ensures gKg⁻¹ = K) it matches the usual proof route. Thus the code assumes a weaker hypothesis than “characteristic in K” yet proves the same conclusion, i.e., it is a slight generalization of the stated theorem.
  • `hHK : H ≤ K` is included but not used; this does not harm the correctness of the translation, although it is redundant here.

3) Final comparison:
- The theorem proven by the code: If for all g, conjugation by g stabilizes K implies it stabilizes H, and K is normal in G, then H is normal in G. This is implied by the natural language hypotheses (since “H characteristic in K” implies invariance under any automorphism of K, in particular those induced by conjugation when K is normal). Hence the code establishes a slightly stronger statement (weaker hypotheses) than the original. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all hypotheses are legitimate and the conclusion matches “H normal in G.” The only minor mismatch is that “characteristic in K” is not encoded via Mathlib’s notion but via a tailored invariance-under-conjugation hypothesis, and `H ≤ K` is unused.

Therefore, the translation is essentially faithful, with a slight generalization.

  • `abs (Complex.abs x - Complex.abs y)` is the real absolute value of |x| − |y|, i.e., ||x| − |y||.
  • `Complex.abs (x - y)` is |x − y|.
  • The statement is `||x| − |y|| ≤ |x − y|`, with no additional hypotheses.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- This exactly matches the natural language statement: for complex x, y, the reverse triangle inequality ||x| − |y|| ≤ |x − y|.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task; we only evaluate the statement’s translation.

Final check:
- The formal statement and the natural language statement are the same mathematical claim.
- No generalization or restriction beyond the original.

Thus, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X] [Nonempty X]`: We work with a type X that is a metric space, complete, and nonempty.
- `theorem baire_countable_intersection_dense_open_nonempty (G : ℕ → Set X) (hopen : ∀ n, IsOpen (G n)) (hdense : ∀ n, Dense (G n)) : ∃ x : X, ∀ n, x ∈ G n := by sorry`:
  This states: Given a sequence of subsets G(n) of X indexed by natural numbers, if each G(n) is open and dense, then there exists x in X that belongs to every G(n). Equivalently, the intersection over all n of G(n) is nonempty.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: X is a nonempty complete metric space; {G_n} is a sequence of dense open sets; prove that the intersection over n = 1 to ∞ of G_n is nonempty (Baire's theorem). The Lean theorem exactly encodes these assumptions: completeness, nonempty, metric space; each G(n) is open and dense; conclusion: there exists x in all G(n), i.e., nonempty intersection.

3) Final check and differences:
- Indexing: The natural language uses n starting at 1; the Lean code indexes over ℕ (starting at 0). This is a harmless reindexing/generalization and standard in formalization; it does not change the mathematical content.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib structures (MetricSpace, CompleteSpace, Dense, IsOpen) are used. The statement matches Baire’s theorem for a countable family of dense open sets in a nonempty complete metric space.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: bring in Mathlib and open set-theoretic notation.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y] {E : Set X} {f : X → Y}`: X and Y are metric spaces; E is a subset of X; f is a function from X to Y.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_4_2a (hf : Continuous f) : f '' closure E ⊆ closure (f '' E)` states: assuming f is continuous, the image under f of the closure of E is contained in the closure of the image of E. Here `f '' A` denotes the image of A under f, and `closure` is the topological closure in the metric space.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If f is continuous from a metric space X to a metric space Y, then for every E ⊆ X, f(\overline{E}) ⊆ \overline{f(E)}.
- Lean: Exactly the same, with metric spaces X, Y, continuity of f, and the subset relation `f '' closure E ⊆ closure (f '' E)`. The variable E is a parameter, so the theorem holds for arbitrary E. Notation matches: `closure` = \overline{·}, `f ''` = image.

  This defines, for E ⊆ ℝ^n (modeled as EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)), the set of condensation points of E as those points x such that for every radius r > 0, the open ball centered at x with radius r intersects E in an uncountable set. Here, uncountable is expressed as ¬Countable.

- `theorem rudin_exercise_2_27a (n : ℕ) {E : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))} (hE : ¬ Set.Countable E) : Perfect (condensation_points n E) := by sorry`
  This states: For any n and any subset E of ℝ^n, if E is uncountable, then the set of condensation points of E is a perfect set. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let E ⊆ ℝ^k be uncountable, and let P be the set of condensation points of E. Prove that P is perfect.

- The ambient space ℝ^k is represented as EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n), which is the standard Mathlib model of ℝ^n. Using a general natural number n matches k.
- The definition of condensation points via “every open ball around x meets E in an uncountable set” matches the standard definition (every neighborhood contains uncountably many points), and using open balls is equivalent in Euclidean spaces.
- Uncountable is correctly encoded as ¬ Set.Countable.
- The conclusion uses `Perfect`, Mathlib’s standard predicate for perfect sets (closed with no isolated points), matching the natural language.

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; `condensation_points` is a bona fide definition using standard Mathlib notions.
- The theorem hypothesis and conclusion precisely match the natural statement.
- Minor formalization choices (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n), using open balls) are standard and faithful.
- Allowing n = 0 is harmless; the hypothesis ¬Countable E cannot hold then, but the statement remains correct conditionally.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib, providing Euclidean space, norms, etc.
- Comment explains the intent: translate Rudin’s exercise about loci |x-a| = 2|x-b| being a sphere with specified center and radius.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_19 (k : ℕ) {a b : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)} (hab : a ≠ b) : ... := by sorry`
  - We fix a natural number k and regard ℝ^k as `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`.
  - Points a, b are in ℝ^k, with an explicit nondegeneracy assumption `a ≠ b`.
  - The conclusion is an existential statement: there exists `c : ℝ^k` and `r : ℝ` such that:
    - `r > 0`.
    - For all `x : ℝ^k`, `‖x - a‖ = 2 * ‖x - b‖` if and only if `‖x - c‖ = r`. This encodes exactly that the locus of points x satisfying the distance ratio condition equals the sphere of center c and radius r.
    - `(3 : ℝ) • c = (4 : ℝ) • b - a`, i.e., `3c = 4b - a` in vector form.
    - `3 * r = 2 * ‖b - a‖`, i.e., `3r = 2|b - a|`.
  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but that does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Given a, b in ℝ^k, find c in ℝ^k and r > 0 such that |x − a| = 2|x − b| iff |x − c| = r, and prove 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2|b − a|.
- The Lean statement precisely formalizes this: it asserts existence of c and r > 0 satisfying the equivalence for all x, and includes the equalities 3c = 4b − a and 3r = 2|b − a|.
- The use of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)` is the standard formalization of ℝ^k in Mathlib.
- The universal quantifier over x in the equivalence matches the intended set equality of loci.

Potential discrepancy:
- The Lean version assumes `a ≠ b`, which is not explicitly stated in the natural language. This is a natural, necessary nondegeneracy assumption: if `a = b`, the equation |x − a| = 2|x − b| reduces to |x − a| = 2|x − a|, which forces x = a, giving a single point set, not representable as a sphere with positive radius. Thus adding `a ≠ b` is a reasonable and standard specialization to the nondegenerate case and aligns with the intent of the exercise.

Auxiliary definitions and vacuity check:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement using standard Mathlib notions (norms, scalar multiplication, EuclideanSpace). No vacuous placeholders are introduced.

Conclusion:
- The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement, with a standard nondegeneracy assumption that matches the mathematical intent.

- The conclusion `∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g ∧ ∀ x : E, g (x : ℝ) = f x` asserts the existence of a function g from ℝ to ℝ that is continuous on ℝ and agrees with f on E; the term `x : E` denotes an element of the subtype E, and `(x : ℝ)` is the coercion of x to ℝ, so `g (x : ℝ) = f x` means g restricted to E equals f pointwise.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; this is a direct theorem statement aligning with standard Mathlib notions (closed set, continuous function on a subtype, continuous function on ℝ).

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: given a real continuous function f defined on a closed set E ⊂ ℝ, there exists a continuous real function g on ℝ agreeing with f on E. The Lean statement exactly encodes this: E is closed, f is continuous on E (subtype), and there exists g : ℝ → ℝ, continuous, such that g|E = f. The pointwise equality over all `x : E` is the correct formalization of agreement on E.

3) Final check — same or different?
They are the same. The Lean statement neither strengthens nor weakens the original: it does not add extra hypotheses, and it captures precisely the existence of a continuous extension of f from a closed subset E of ℝ to all of ℝ. There are no red flags or vacuous placeholders; the code uses standard Mathlib notions. Thus the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: For every real number M > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all natural numbers n with n ≥ N, the finite sum over i = 0, 1, ..., n−1 of (√(i+1) − √i) is at least M. In symbols: ∀ M > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} (√(i+1) − √i) ≥ M.
  Here `Finset.range n` denotes {0,1,...,n−1}, and the summand is exactly a_i = √(i+1) − √i with i understood as a natural number, coerced to ℝ inside the square roots.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
The natural statement is: “Prove that lim_{n→∞} ∑_{i<n} a_i = ∞, where a_i = √(i+1) − √i.” The Lean statement asserts the definition of divergence to +∞ of the sequence of partial sums: for every M > 0, eventually the partial sums exceed M. The sum is taken over i < n (implemented as `Finset.range n`). The summand matches a_i. Thus the Lean theorem is precisely the formal version of “the partial sums tend to +∞.”

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions, and the indexing and summand match exactly. The slight formalization difference (using the epsilon–N formulation for divergence to +∞) is standard and faithful.

  This states that the sequence s_seq converges to 2 (i.e., tends to 2 as n → ∞) and that for all n, s_seq n < 2.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines s_1 = √2 and s_{n+1} = √(2 + √(s_n)) for n ≥ 1, and asks to prove that {s_n} converges and that s_n < 2 for all n ≥ 1.
- The Lean code uses 0-based indexing: s_seq 0 = √2 and the same recurrence for n+1, so s_seq n corresponds to s_{n+1} in the natural language statement. This indexing shift is acceptable as a common formalization convention.
- However, the theorem in Lean claims that the limit is exactly 2. The natural language statement only asks to show convergence (without specifying the limit) and the bound s_n < 2. Moreover, for the given recurrence with an inner √(s_n), the actual limit is not 2; it satisfies L = √(2 + √L), numerically about 1.8316. Thus, asserting convergence to 2 is not merely a strengthening—it is incorrect for this sequence and therefore not faithful to the statement.
- The bound part `∀ n, s_seq n < 2` is stronger than required (it includes n=0 as well), which is acceptable, but the incorrect limit claim makes the translation fail.

3) Final check: The two problems are different. The code asserts convergence to 2, while the original problem does not specify the limit (and for the given recursion, the limit is not 2). The indexing shift is minor, but the limit claim is a substantive discrepancy.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_3_20` states: For a sequence `u : ℕ → X` and a point `p : X`, if `u` is a Cauchy sequence (`CauchySeq u`), and there is a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` (`StrictMono φ`) such that the subsequence `(u ∘ φ)` tends to `p` (`Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds p)`), then the whole sequence `u` tends to `p` (`Tendsto u atTop (nhds p)`).
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the only statement is the theorem with a `sorry` proof placeholder.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If `{p_n}` is a Cauchy sequence in a metric space X, and some subsequence `{p_{n_l}}` converges to `p ∈ X`, then the full sequence `{p_n}` converges to `p`.
- Lean: Exactly the same content. `u` corresponds to `{p_n}`; `φ` and `StrictMono φ` represent the subsequence index `n_l`; `Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds p)` is subsequence convergence to `p`; `Tendsto u atTop (nhds p)` is the conclusion.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement precisely captures the metric-space context, Cauchy property, existence of a subsequence converging to `p`, and concludes convergence of the original sequence to `p`.
- Requiring `StrictMono φ` is the standard way to encode subsequences in Lean and matches the intended meaning of `{p_{n_l}}`.
- No extraneous conditions or weakening/strengthening are present.

Conclusion: The formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_4 {n : ℕ} (C : Fin (n+1) → ℝ)` introduces a natural number n and a sequence of real coefficients indexed by `k = 0, …, n`, represented as a function `C` from `Fin (n+1)` to ℝ. This exactly models real constants C₀, …, Cₙ.
- The hypothesis `(h : (∑ k : Fin (n+1), C k / ((k.val : ℝ) + 1)) = 0)` states that the sum over k = 0..n of `C k / (k+1)` equals 0. Since `k.val` is the natural number k and `C 0 / (0+1) = C₀`, this matches the condition `C₀ + C₁/2 + ... + Cₙ/(n+1) = 0` exactly.
- The conclusion `∃ x : ℝ, x ∈ Ioo (0 : ℝ) 1 ∧ (∑ k : Fin (n+1), C k * x ^ k.val) = 0` asserts there exists a real x in the open interval (0, 1) such that the sum ∑_{k=0}^n C_k x^k equals 0. Since `x ^ 0 = 1`, this is precisely the polynomial equation `C₀ + C₁ x + ... + Cₙ x^n = 0` having a root strictly between 0 and 1.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- Indexing and denominators align perfectly: `C k / (k+1)` reproduces `C_k/(k+1)`, with the k = 0 term being `C₀`.
- The conclusion matches the existence of a real root in (0, 1). The phrase “between 0 and 1” is standardly interpreted as strictly between, i.e., the open interval, which is exactly `Ioo (0) 1`.
- The coefficients are real constants, modeled as a function `Fin (n+1) → ℝ`. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous placeholder definitions; the statement is direct and uses standard Mathlib notions.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem statement is essentially identical to the natural language statement, with no generalization or restriction beyond standard formalization details. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_24 {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We consider real numbers a, b and a real-valued function f on ℝ.
- `(hcont : ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b))`: Hypothesis that f is continuous on the open interval (a, b).
- `(hmid : ∀ x y, x ∈ Ioo a b → y ∈ Ioo a b → f ((x + y) / 2) ≤ (f x + f y) / 2)`: Hypothesis that for all x, y in (a, b), the midpoint inequality holds: f((x+y)/2) ≤ (f(x)+f(y))/2.
- `: ConvexOn ℝ (Ioo a b) f`: Conclusion that f is convex on the set (a, b) over the real numbers; i.e., for all x, y in (a, b) and t in [0,1], f(t x + (1 - t) y) ≤ t f(x) + (1 - t) f(y).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: f is a continuous real function defined on (a, b) and satisfies the midpoint convexity inequality for all x, y in (a, b). Prove f is convex. The Lean hypotheses exactly encode continuity on (a, b) via ContinuousOn and the midpoint inequality for all x, y in the interval. The conclusion ConvexOn ℝ (Ioo a b) f matches “f is convex on (a, b).” Using f : ℝ → ℝ with continuity restricted to Ioo a b is a standard and faithful formalization of “defined in (a, b).”

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Domains: Both use the open interval (a, b). Lean uses Ioo a b which is (a, b).
- Assumptions: Continuity on (a, b) and midpoint inequality on (a, b) appear verbatim.
- Conclusion: Convexity on (a, b). This matches exactly.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; all notions are from Mathlib.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

- Natural language: ""Let X be a topological space; let A be a subset of X. Suppose that for each x ∈ A there is an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ A. Show that A is open in X.""

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_3_8 (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : Summable a)`: We have two real sequences `a` and `b`. The hypothesis `ha : Summable a` means the series Σ a_n (over n ∈ ℕ) converges.
- `(hb_mon : Monotone b ∨ Antitone b)`: The sequence `b` is monotone, meaning it is either nondecreasing (Monotone) or nonincreasing (Antitone).
- `(hb_bdd : ∃ M, 0 ≤ M ∧ ∀ n, abs (b n) ≤ M)`: The sequence `b` is bounded in absolute value by some nonnegative constant `M`.
- `: Summable fun n => a n * b n`: Conclusion: the series Σ (a_n b_n) converges.
There are no auxiliary definitions; all properties are standard Mathlib notions for real sequences and series.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: If Σ a_n converges, and {b_n} is monotonic and bounded, then Σ a_n b_n converges. This is exactly Abel's test. The Lean statement matches this precisely: it assumes convergence of Σ a_n, monotonicity (either direction) of b_n, boundedness of b_n, and concludes the convergence of Σ a_n b_n.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses ℕ (starting at 0) rather than starting at 1; this is a harmless conventional difference.
- Field: The Lean version is over ℝ; the natural language statement did not specify, but ℝ is standard and faithful.
- Monotonicity: Lean explicitly allows either nondecreasing or nonincreasing via `Monotone b ∨ Antitone b`, matching the usual meaning of ""monotonic.""
- Boundedness: Lean encodes boundedness via an absolute bound `|b n| ≤ M`, which is equivalent to boundedness of a real sequence.
No extraneous or vacuous definitions are present.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- `def is_open_map {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) : Prop := ∀ U : Set X, IsOpen U → IsOpen (f '' U)`:
  This defines the predicate ""f is an open map"" to mean: for every open set U in X, the image f(U) is open in Y. This is exactly the standard definition.
- `theorem prod_fst_is_open_map ... : is_open_map (Prod.fst : X × Y → X) := by sorry`:
  States that the first projection π₁: X × Y → X is an open map for any topological spaces X and Y.
- `theorem prod_snd_is_open_map ... : is_open_map (Prod.snd : X × Y → Y) := by sorry`:
  States that the second projection π₂: X × Y → Y is an open map for any topological spaces X and Y.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The natural language statement defines an open map exactly as the image of every open set being open, and asks to show that the product projections π₁ and π₂ are open maps.
- The Lean code defines the same concept (with a custom name `is_open_map`, equivalent to Mathlib’s `IsOpenMap`) and asserts precisely that `Prod.fst` and `Prod.snd` satisfy this property.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence and note differences.
- Equivalence: The mathematical content matches exactly: definition of open map and the claim that both projections from a product are open.
- Differences: The code uses a custom predicate name `is_open_map` rather than Mathlib’s `IsOpenMap`, but the definition is correct and non-vacuous. It uses `Prod.fst`/`Prod.snd` instead of π₁/π₂, which is the standard Lean naming. No extra assumptions are introduced, and no weakening/strengthening occurs.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- def quad_poly (n : Int) : Polynomial Int := X ^ 2 + C n: Defines the integer-coefficient polynomial X^2 + n. This is the minimal polynomial over ℤ for an element α with α^2 = -n.
- theorem two_irreducible (n : Int) (hn : 3 < n) (hsq : Squarefree n) : Irreducible (2 : AdjoinRoot (quad_poly n)) := by sorry: States that under the hypotheses n > 3 and n squarefree, the element 2 is irreducible in the ring AdjoinRoot (X^2 + n), i.e., ℤ[X]/(X^2 + n). This ring is canonically isomorphic to ℤ[√(-n)], since the adjoined root satisfies α^2 = -n.
- theorem sqrt_neg_irreducible ... : Irreducible (AdjoinRoot.root (quad_poly n) : AdjoinRoot (quad_poly n)) := by sorry: States that the distinguished element root in AdjoinRoot (X^2 + n) (the class of X modulo the relation X^2 + n = 0) is irreducible. This element corresponds to √(-n).
- theorem one_add_sqrt_neg_irreducible ... : Irreducible (1 + (AdjoinRoot.root (quad_poly n) : AdjoinRoot (quad_poly n))) := by sorry: States that 1 + √(-n) is irreducible in the same ring.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language statement: Let R = ℤ[√(-n)] where n is a squarefree integer greater than 3. Prove that 2, √(-n), and 1 + √(-n) are irreducible in R.

The Lean code models R as AdjoinRoot (X^2 + n) over ℤ, which is the standard algebraic construction isomorphic to ℤ[√(-n)] because the adjoined root satisfies α^2 = -n. The three theorems assert precisely the irreducibility of:
- 2 in R
- √(-n) in R (represented by AdjoinRoot.root)
- 1 + √(-n) in R
under assumptions n > 3 and Squarefree n. This matches the given conditions.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- The use of AdjoinRoot (X^2 + n) over ℤ is a faithful formalization of ℤ[√(-n)].
- The element AdjoinRoot.root corresponds exactly to √(-n).
- The assumptions (n : Int), 3 < n, Squarefree n align with “n is a squarefree integer greater than 3.” The shift from ℕ to ℤ is harmless since 3 < n enforces positivity.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; quad_poly is a legitimate polynomial, and the theorems are stated without fake predicates. Proofs are omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language problem.

- If the `sorry` were replaced by an actual construction (e.g., using the infimum `iInf` of topologies or `sInf` of a set of topologies), it would be faithful. As written, it fails to establish the claim.

- The docstring states the claim: If f is continuous and E is dense in X, then f(E) is dense in f(X). It also notes they phrase this as `range f ⊆ closure (f '' E)`.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_4a {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] {f : X → Y} {E : Set X} (hf : Continuous f) (hE : Dense E) : range f ⊆ closure (f '' E) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any topological spaces X and Y, any continuous map f : X → Y, and any dense subset E of X, the image f(X) is contained in the closure (in Y) of f(E). Equivalently, f(E) is dense in f(X) with the subspace topology.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: X and Y are metric spaces; f and g are continuous; E is dense in X; conclude f(E) is dense in f(X).
- Lean: Generalizes to topological spaces (a slight generalization that is valid), mentions only f (g is unused in the original conclusion). The conclusion `range f ⊆ closure (f '' E)` is a standard equivalent formulation of “f(E) is dense in f(X)” because in a subspace T = f(X), S is dense in T iff T ⊆ closure_Y(S).
- Thus the Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a mild generalization) of the intended result about f.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Generalization from metric spaces to topological spaces: acceptable and faithful since the statement remains true in the more general setting.
- Omission of g: the original mention of g is extraneous to the conclusion and does not affect the statement being formalized.
- Conclusion phrased via subset of closure in Y: equivalent to stating density of f(E) in f(X).

Overall, the code is a legitimate and faithful translation (slightly more general) of the natural language statement.

- The IVP assumption is expressed in a standard, order-symmetric form using a disjunction to cover both f(a)<c<f(b) and f(b)<c<f(a); this is equivalent to the usual intermediate value property and aligns with the natural language intent. Using min/max ensures “between a and b” regardless of whether a ≤ b or b ≤ a.
- The closedness of rational level sets is exactly as stated.
- The conclusion “f is continuous” matches.

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced. The assumptions are direct and meaningful. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable here since we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, potentially slightly more symmetric in the IVP hypothesis but mathematically equivalent. No discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_6 {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We consider a real-valued function f on ℝ.
- `(h_cont : ContinuousOn f (Ici (0 : ℝ)))`: f is continuous on the closed half-line [0, ∞).
- `(h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Ioi (0 : ℝ)))`: f is differentiable on the open half-line (0, ∞).
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)`: f(0) = 0.
- `(h_der_mono : MonotoneOn (fun x => deriv f x) (Ioi (0 : ℝ)))`: the derivative f' (expressed as deriv f x, which agrees with the usual derivative on points where f is differentiable) is monotone increasing on (0, ∞).
- `: MonotoneOn (fun x => f x / x) (Ioi (0 : ℝ))`: Under these assumptions, the function g(x) = f(x)/x is monotone increasing on (0, ∞).
- The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; only the statement is provided.

All notions used (`ContinuousOn`, `DifferentiableOn`, `deriv`, `MonotoneOn`, `Ici 0`, `Ioi 0`) are standard Mathlib definitions and not placeholders.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the original statement?
- The natural language statement assumes: (a) continuity on x ≥ 0, (b) existence of f'(x) for x > 0, (c) f(0) = 0, (d) f' is monotonically increasing, defines g(x) = f(x)/x for x > 0, and concludes g is monotonically increasing.
- The Lean code encodes exactly these hypotheses and conclusion: continuity on [0, ∞), differentiability on (0, ∞) (which is the standard formalization of “f'(x) exists”), f(0) = 0, f' monotone on (0, ∞), and the conclusion that x ↦ f(x)/x is monotone on (0, ∞).
- “Monotonically increasing” is interpreted as nondecreasing; Mathlib’s `MonotoneOn` has that meaning, which matches the usual interpretation of the phrase in analysis texts.
- The derivative is expressed via `deriv f x`, and with the differentiability assumption on (0, ∞), this matches the classical derivative there.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Domains match: (0, ∞) and [0, ∞) as appropriate.
- Assumptions match: continuity, differentiability (existence of derivative), value at 0, monotonicity of derivative.
- Conclusion matches: monotonicity of g(x) = f(x)/x on (0, ∞).
- No extraneous assumptions or weakenings. No vacuous or placeholder definitions. Thus the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

  Let a be a real number and f : ℝ → ℝ. Assume f is C^2 (twice continuously differentiable) on the open ray (a, ∞).
- `(M0 M1 M2 : ℝ)`:
  Let M0, M1, M2 be real numbers.
- `(h0 : ∀ x ∈ Ioi a, |f x| ≤ M0)`:
  For all x > a, |f(x)| ≤ M0 (so M0 is an upper bound of |f| on (a, ∞)).
- `(h1 : ∀ x ∈ Ioi a, |deriv f x| ≤ M1)`:
  For all x > a, |f'(x)| ≤ M1 (M1 is an upper bound for |f'| on (a, ∞)).
- `(h2 : ∀ x ∈ Ioi a, |(deriv (deriv f)) x| ≤ M2)`:
  For all x > a, |f''(x)| ≤ M2 (M2 is an upper bound for |f''| on (a, ∞)).
- Conclusion: `M1^2 ≤ 4 * M0 * M2`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement specifies: f is twice-differentiable on (a, ∞), and M0, M1, M2 are the least upper bounds (suprema) of |f|, |f'|, |f''| on (a, ∞). The desired inequality is M1^2 ≤ 4 M0 M2.
- The Lean statement assumes f is C^2 on (a, ∞), which is stronger than merely twice differentiable (it requires continuity of derivatives up to order 2).
- Crucially, the Lean statement only assumes M0, M1, M2 are upper bounds, not least upper bounds. There is no IsLUB/sSup condition; instead, it universally quantifies over any bounds M0, M1, M2 satisfying the inequalities.
- The conclusion is the same inequality M1^2 ≤ 4 M0 M2.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- Differences:
  - Regularity: ContDiffOn ℝ 2 is stronger than “twice differentiable.” This is a specialization (stronger hypothesis) and would be acceptable as a faithful formalization if everything else matched.
  - Bounds: The major discrepancy is that the Lean theorem claims the inequality for any upper bounds M0, M1, M2, not specifically their least upper bounds. The original claim is about the suprema. The Lean version is a stronger statement and does not encode the “least”/supremum property at all. This changes the quantification and is not a faithful translation.
- Other aspects (domain (a, ∞), interpretation of deriv and second derivative) are consistent.

Conclusion: Not faithful, due to missing the “least upper bound” requirement and instead asserting a stronger universal statement over arbitrary upper bounds. The stronger smoothness assumption is a minor specialization and acceptable, but the suprema vs. arbitrary bounds mismatch is substantial.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: X is a type with a topology; i.e., a topological space.
- `variable {Y : Type*} [MetricSpace Y]`: Y is a type with a metric; i.e., a metric space.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_21_8` takes:
  - `f : ℕ → X → Y`: a sequence of functions f_n: X → Y.
  - `f_lim : X → Y`: a function f: X → Y (the purported uniform limit).
  - `x_seq : ℕ → X`: a sequence x_n in X.
  - `x0 : X`: a point x in X, the limit of x_n.
  - `h_cont : ∀ n, Continuous (f n)`: each f_n is continuous.
  - `h_x : Tendsto x_seq atTop (nhds x0)`: x_n → x0 in X (sequence convergence in the topological space sense).
  - `h_unif : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ t : X, dist (f n t) (f_lim t) < ε`: uniform convergence of f_n to f_lim on X in the metric on Y.
  - Conclusion: `Tendsto (fun n => f n (x_seq n)) atTop (nhds (f_lim x0))`: the sequence f_n(x_n) converges to f(x0) in Y.
- The docstring clearly states the intended mathematical claim: If f_n → f uniformly and x_n → x, then f_n(x_n) → f(x).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness.
- The hypotheses exactly match the natural language statement: X topological space, Y metric space, f_n continuous, x_n → x, and f_n → f uniformly.
- The conclusion exactly matches: f_n(x_n) → f(x).
- The formalization uses the standard epsilon-N definition of uniform convergence over all t : X via the metric on Y, and sequence convergence via filters, both standard in Mathlib.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The natural language includes continuity of f_n; the Lean code includes it as `h_cont`. Although continuity is not used in the implication, including it matches the statement and does not harm faithfulness.
- No extra or missing assumptions relative to the statement; no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms come from Mathlib.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful formal translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {X : Type _} {α : Type _} (T : α → TopologicalSpace X)`: We fix a type X and an index type α, and a family of topologies T on X indexed by α.
- `def union_opens_set : Set (Set X) := { U | ∃ i, @IsOpen X (T i) U }`: Define the set of subsets of X that are open in at least one topology T i; i.e., the union of all open sets across the family.
- The theorem `exists_unique_smallest_topology_containing` states there exists a unique topology τ on X such that (i) for every i and every U, if U is open in T i then U is open in τ (so τ contains all the opens from each T i), and (ii) if τ' is any other topology on X that also contains all opens from each T i, then every τ-open set is τ'-open (so τ is contained in every such τ', i.e., τ is the smallest among all topologies containing each T i). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the construction mentions `TopologicalSpace.generateFrom (union_opens_set T)` as a witness, which is the standard way to generate the smallest topology containing a given collection of subsets.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Let T_α be a family of topologies on X. Show that there is a unique smallest topology on X containing all the collections T_α."" The Lean theorem exactly asserts existence and uniqueness of a smallest topology τ containing all the T i, using the standard order on topologies (τ contains all opens of each T i, and τ is minimal with that property). This matches the statement precisely. The code’s auxiliary definition `union_opens_set` faithfully represents the union of open sets across the family and the use of `generateFrom` matches the standard construction.
- The presence of `sorry` is in the proof, not in definitions, and the task is about translation of the statement, which is correct and non-vacuous.

3) Final check of differences:
- No mismatch: the Lean statement uses ∃! with the exact minimality property; this is the formal version of ""unique smallest topology containing all T_α"". No extra conditions or restrictions are introduced, and no generalization/specialization issues occur. The auxiliary definition is legitimate, not vacuous.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_21_6a (x : ℝ) (hx : x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)` assumes a real number x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
- The conclusion `Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => x ^ n) atTop (nhds (if x = 1 then 1 else 0))` states that the sequence n ↦ x^n tends to the limit (in the real topology) given by 1 if x = 1, and 0 otherwise. In other words, for each fixed x ∈ [0,1], x^n → 1 if x=1, and x^n → 0 if 0 ≤ x < 1.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The original statement defines f_n(x) = x^n on [0,1] and asks to show that (f_n(x)) converges for each x ∈ [0,1].
- The Lean statement proves a stronger result: not only convergence, but also the exact limit: 0 for x ∈ [0,1), and 1 for x=1. This is consistent with the expected behavior and implies the requested convergence.

Step 3: Final check.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem directly uses standard Mathlib constructs (Tendsto, atTop, nhds, Set.Icc).
- The Lean statement is a faithful and slightly stronger formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib's standard library.
- The whole comment block sets the context: we are working with the polynomial ring in countably many variables over ℤ, formalized as MvPolynomial ℕ Int, and the ideal generated by the products X (2*k) * X (2*k+1) for k : ℕ. The goal is to show there are infinitely many minimal prime ideals over this ideal.
- Theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_1_10: There exists a function f : ℕ → Ideal (MvPolynomial ℕ Int) that is injective, and for every n, the ideal f n is prime, contains the ideal I := Ideal.span (Set.range (fun k => X(2k) * X(2k+1))), and is minimal over I in the sense that for any prime ideal Q with I ≤ Q ≤ f n, we must have Q = f n.

Step 2: Assess if the translation matches the original statement.
- Original statement: The ring ℤ[x1, x2, x3, …]/(x1 x2, x3 x4, x5 x6, …) contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals.
- Equivalence: Minimal prime ideals of the quotient ring R/I correspond bijectively to prime ideals of R containing I that are minimal over I. Therefore, exhibiting an injective sequence of prime ideals in R that are minimal over I is equivalent to showing the quotient has infinitely many minimal primes.
- The code uses MvPolynomial ℕ Int for ℤ[x1, x2, …], and defines I as the ideal generated by {X(2k)*X(2k+1) | k ∈ ℕ}, i.e., products of consecutive pairs (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), … This is a harmless reindexing relative to (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), … since both sets of variables are countably infinite; a bijection between index sets gives an isomorphic setup.
- The theorem asserts: there is an injective map f: ℕ → ideals of R such that each f n is prime, contains I, and is minimal among prime ideals containing I. This exactly encodes “infinitely many minimal prime ideals over I,” hence (by correspondence) infinitely many minimal prime ideals in the quotient R/I.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Use of ℕ starting at 0 vs indices starting at 1 is a benign reindexing; no substantive difference.
- Working in the original ring with primes minimal over I rather than in the quotient is standard and equivalent.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with standard Mathlib notions (Ideal, IsPrime, Ideal.span, Set.range, Function.Injective). The proof is omitted, but the statement is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  • `Tendsto x atTop (nhds x0)` means the sequence x converges to x0 in the product topology.
  • The right-hand side `∀ i, Tendsto (fun n => x n i) atTop (nhds (x0 i))` says: for each coordinate i, the component sequence n ↦ x n i converges to x0 i in X i. This is exactly the statement that the projections π_i(x_n) converge to π_i(x0) for each i.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement asserts: A sequence in the product ∏ X_α converges to x iff, for each α, the projected sequence π_α(x_i) converges to π_α(x). The Lean statement is precisely the equivalence between convergence in the product (left side) and coordinatewise convergence (right side), with π_α identified as evaluation `(· i)`.
- The use of atTop and nhds is the standard formalization of sequence convergence. The product is the Π-type with the product topology. No extraneous assumptions are added.

3) Final comparison:
- They are the same mathematical statement. Minor presentational differences (sequence indices starting at 0 vs 1, use of filters) are inessential.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly matches the natural language claim.

- `(h_conn : ∀ n, IsConnected (A n))` assumes each A_n is connected (as a subspace of X); in mathlib, `IsConnected (A n)` for a set means A_n is nonempty and preconnected, i.e., connected in the subspace topology.
- `(h_nonempty : ∀ n, (A n ∩ A (n+1)).Nonempty)` assumes each consecutive pair A_n and A_{n+1} has nonempty intersection.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: a sequence {A_n} of connected subspaces of X with A_n ∩ A_{n+1} ≠ ∅ for all n implies that ⋃ A_n is connected.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: a sequence indexed by ℕ, each connected, consecutive intersections nonempty, and the union over n is connected.
- Using sets in Lean to represent subspaces is standard; `IsConnected (A n)` refers to connectedness in the subspace topology. The intersection nonempty condition is expressed via `(A n ∩ A (n+1)).Nonempty`, equivalent to “≠ ∅”. The union `⋃ n, A n` is the set-theoretic union over the sequence.
- Indexing by ℕ is the usual meaning of “sequence,” so there is no substantive change. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Set Metric: Standard imports and namespaces.
- variable {α : Type _} [MetricSpace α] [TopologicalSpace α]: We work on a type α with both a metric structure and (independently) a topological structure.
- def IsPerfect (s : Set α) : Prop := IsClosed s ∧ ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ r : ℝ, 0 < r → ∃ y ∈ s, y ≠ x ∧ dist x y < r: A set s is defined to be perfect if it is closed (with respect to the given TopologicalSpace α) and has no isolated points in the metric sense: for every point x in s and every radius r > 0, there exists a different point y in s with dist x y < r.
- theorem Rudin_exercise_2_28 (s q : Set α) (hq : q.Countable) (hd : Dense q) (hs : IsClosed s) : ∃ t u : Set α, s = t ∪ u ∧ IsPerfect t ∧ Set.Countable u := by sorry: Given a set s and a countable dense subset q of α (density and closedness taken with respect to the given TopologicalSpace α) and s closed, there exist sets t and u with s = t ∪ u, t perfect (in the sense above), and u countable.

Step 2: Assess overall faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Intended statement: In a separable metric space (i.e., there exists a countable dense subset with respect to the metric topology), every closed set is the union of a (possibly empty) perfect set and an at most countable set.
- The code introduces a countable dense subset q to formalize separability, and assumes s is closed. The conclusion provides t perfect and u countable with s = t ∪ u. Since equality of unions implies t, u ⊆ s, that part aligns. The definition of perfect used (closed and metric no-isolated-points) is the standard characterization in metric spaces, and it allows the empty set (vacuously), so that matches “possibly empty”. Using Set.Countable matches “at most countable”.

Step 3: Critical discrepancy.
- The code simultaneously assumes [MetricSpace α] and an arbitrary [TopologicalSpace α], without asserting that the topology is the one induced by the metric. As a result, IsClosed s and Dense q are with respect to the arbitrary TopologicalSpace instance, while the “no isolated points” part of IsPerfect uses the metric (dist). In a faithful formalization of “separable metric space”, the topology should be induced by the metric, so that closedness, density, and the metric notions align. Here they may not align, leading to a statement about a space endowed with potentially inconsistent topology and metric. This is a real mismatch with the natural language statement.

Other checks:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; IsPerfect is a legitimate definition. The theorem’s shape matches the intended decomposition. The only substantial issue is the independent TopologicalSpace instance.

Conclusion: The code is almost faithful, but the independence of the TopologicalSpace from the MetricSpace breaks the intended meaning of “separable metric space” and “closed set” relative to the metric topology. Therefore, it is not fully faithful.

",1,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The comment states: If E ⊆ ℝ is bounded and f : E → ℝ is uniformly continuous, then f is bounded on E. This frames the intended theorem.
- open Set: just opens the namespace for set-theoretic notation.
- variable {E : Set ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}: E is a subset of ℝ; f is a function ℝ → ℝ (we will consider its restriction to E).
- theorem uniformly_continuous_on.bounded_image_of_bounded (hE : ∃ M : ℝ, 0 ≤ M ∧ ∀ x ∈ E, |x| ≤ M) (hfu : UniformContinuousOn f E) : ∃ R : ℝ, 0 ≤ R ∧ ∀ y ∈ f '' E, |y| ≤ R := by sorry
  Natural language: If E is bounded in ℝ (there exists M ≥ 0 such that for all x ∈ E, |x| ≤ M) and f is uniformly continuous on E, then the image f(E) is bounded in ℝ (there exists R ≥ 0 such that for all y ∈ f(E), |y| ≤ R). The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the original natural language statement.
- Original statement: Let E be a bounded set in ℝ. Prove that there exists a real function f such that f is uniformly continuous and is not bounded on E.
- The Lean theorem asserts the exact opposite phenomenon: every uniformly continuous f on a bounded E has bounded image on E. In fact, it shows such an unbounded uniformly continuous f cannot exist.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- The two statements are fundamentally different and incompatible. The Lean code formalizes a universal boundedness result for uniformly continuous maps on bounded domains; the natural language statement asks for the existence of a counterexample (a uniformly continuous but unbounded function on a bounded set). Thus, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the given statement.
- Technical notes: The code uses standard Mathlib notions (UniformContinuousOn, image) and makes no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The presence of sorry is acceptable per instructions about omitting proofs, but it does not affect the mismatch in content.

Conclusion: Not faithful; it asserts the negation of the requested statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [LinearOrder Y] [OrderTopology Y]`
  This declares types X and Y. X has a topological space structure. Y has a topological space structure, a linear order, and its topology is the order topology (expressed by the typeclass `[OrderTopology Y]`, which in mathlib asserts that the given `TopologicalSpace Y` coincides with the order topology coming from the `LinearOrder Y`). This matches the phrase ""Y be an ordered set in the order topology"" and provides the standard setup needed for continuity statements.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_18_8b (f g : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : Continuous fun x => min (f x) (g x) := by sorry`
  This states: given continuous functions f, g from X to Y, the function h defined by h(x) = min(f x, g x) is continuous. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for checking faithfulness of the statement.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let Y be an ordered set with the order topology; let f, g: X → Y be continuous; define h(x) = min{f(x), g(x)}; show h is continuous.
- Lean: Exactly encodes Y as a linearly ordered topological space with the order topology (`[LinearOrder Y] [OrderTopology Y]`), assumes f and g are continuous, and concludes that x ↦ min (f x) (g x) is continuous.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced. There are no auxiliary definitions at all.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only slight technical addition is explicitly carrying topologies on X and Y, which is necessary for formalization and consistent with the natural language context. The `[OrderTopology Y]` class ensures the topology on Y is indeed the order topology, matching the premise. The use of `min` is exactly h(x)=min{f(x),g(x)}.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

The natural language statement is: ""Show that the rationals ℚ are not locally compact."" The Lean theorem states exactly `¬ LocallyCompactSpace Rat`, which is the precise formalization of ""ℚ is not locally compact.""

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""If X has a countable dense subset, every collection of disjoint open sets in X is countable."" The Lean statement assumes X has a countable dense subset and considers an arbitrary family of pairwise disjoint open sets, concluding that the index set is countable. It explicitly assumes each open set is nonempty. This is a standard and necessary clarification: allowing empty open sets would make the statement false (one could take arbitrarily many copies of the empty set). Thus the Lean version is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Hypotheses: Countable dense subset — matches exactly.
- Collection of disjoint open sets — expressed as a family (U i) with pairwise disjointness; standard formalization.
- Nonempty assumption — an implicit requirement in the intended statement to avoid trivial counterexamples; acceptable and customary.
- Conclusion: The family is countable — formulated as the index type ι being countable via (Set.univ : Set ι).Countable; equivalent.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with omitted proof. The translation is legitimate and faithful.

  (s : Set X) (hs : IsOpen s) (hconn : IsConnected s) : IsPathConnected s := by sorry

Natural language: Let X be a topological space. Assume that for every point x in X there exists an open set U with x ∈ U such that U is path-connected (as a subspace). Let s be a subset of X which is open and connected. Then s is path-connected (as a subspace).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement says: “Let X be locally path connected. Show that every connected open set in X is path connected.” In standard topology, “X is locally path connected” means that for each x and each neighborhood U of x, there exists a path-connected open neighborhood V of x with V ⊆ U (equivalently, x has a basis of path-connected neighborhoods).
- The code’s assumption local_path only gives: for each x, there exists some open path-connected neighborhood U containing x. This is strictly weaker than having a basis of path-connected neighborhoods (or the equivalent refinement property for every neighborhood). The docstring even says “basis of path-connected neighborhoods,” but the quantified hypothesis does not encode a basis—only existence of one such neighborhood per point.
- The rest of the statement (s open and connected implies s path-connected) matches the natural language.

3) Final comparison:
- The key discrepancy is the hypothesis: the code assumes a weaker property than local path connectedness. Hence it claims a stronger result than the original statement. This is not a mere slight generalization but a substantive weakening of the assumptions, and thus not a faithful translation. There are no vacuous placeholder definitions; the mismatch is conceptual in the main hypothesis.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

This states that for each subset U of X, U is open in the topology generated by A if and only if U is open in every topology t on X that makes all members of A open. Expressed as equality of the two predicates (functions from subsets to Prop). The hypothesis hA is that A is a basis (as defined above), though it is not actually needed for the truth of the statement.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language claim: If A is a basis on X, then the topology generated by A equals the intersection of all topologies on X that contain A.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes that the open sets of generateFrom A are those sets open in every topology t with A ⊆ opens(t), which is precisely the open sets of the intersection of all such topologies. Using equality of predicates is a standard way to express equality of the collections of open sets (and hence equality of the resulting topologies). The assumption that A is a basis is present; even though it is unnecessary for the truth of the universal property, it matches the hypothesis in the natural language statement.

Step 3: Comparison and potential discrepancies
- The auxiliary definition IsBasis is legitimate and matches the standard definition; no vacuous placeholders.
- The theorem’s conclusion is equivalent to the intersection characterization of the generated topology. It quantifies over all topologies containing A and asserts U is open in each such topology.
- Minor note: The assumption hA is superfluous for the universal property but aligns with the natural language hypothesis; it does not distort the claim.
- The theorem is stated as equality of predicates rather than equality of topological spaces, but these are equivalent in this context and faithfully represent the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  • Intersection axiom: If U and V are such rational open intervals and x lies in U ∩ V, then there exists another rational-open interval W with x ∈ W ⊆ U ∩ V.

- The natural language asks to show that the collection {(a, b) | a < b, a and b rational} is a basis and that the topology it generates is different from the lower limit topology on ℝ.

  • It defines that collection and states the basis axioms hold for it.
  • It defines the topology generated by this collection.
  • It defines the lower limit (Sorgenfrey) topology via [a, b) sets and asserts the two topologies are different.
- The use of TopologicalSpace.generateFrom is standard to formalize “the topology generated by a given collection.”

- `theorem locally_compact_t2_implies_t3 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [LocallyCompactSpace X] [T2Space X] : T3Space X := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology, if X is locally compact and Hausdorff (T2), then X is T3 (regular, in the sense used by Mathlib). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: ""Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is regular.""
- Lean statement: If X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, then X is a T3Space.
- In Mathlib, `T2Space` is Hausdorff. `T3Space` corresponds to regularity together with T1 (regular T1). Since Hausdorff implies T1, asserting `T3Space X` under the hypothesis `[T2Space X]` matches (and is standardly equivalent to) the usual notion of a regular Hausdorff space. Thus the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib typeclasses are used.
- The conclusion is possibly slightly stronger in naming (T3Space rather than just RegularSpace), but under the Hausdorff assumption they coincide with the intended notion of regularity in standard topology texts (including Munkres). Hence, no substantive discrepancy.

  Natural language: For any topological space X and subset s of X, if s is closed in X, then from the assumption that X is a normal space it follows that the subspace s (viewed as the subtype `↥s` with the induced/subspace topology) is also a normal space. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: ""Show that a closed subspace of a normal space is normal."" 
- The Lean statement exactly asserts: if s is closed in X and X is normal, then the subspace `s` is normal. This is precisely the same mathematical content.

3) Final check of differences:
- The Lean code specifies the subspace as the subtype `↥s`, which is the standard way to model the subspace topology in Lean. 
- There are no additional or missing hypotheses compared to the natural language statement. No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- Conclusion: The two statements are the same.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Prove that −(−v) = v for every v ∈ V. The Lean theorem states exactly that, with the explicit (and standard) assumption that V is an additive group, which is the minimal structure needed to make sense of negation. This matches the intended mathematical context (e.g., vector spaces are additive groups), and the comment explicitly notes this.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. The Lean version slightly generalizes the context to any additive group (which includes vector spaces), which is appropriate and faithful. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement is given. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} {A : Set X}`: We are working with a type X and a subset A of X.
- `[TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace (Subtype A)]`: X is a topological space, and the subtype A (i.e., the type of elements of X together with a proof that they lie in A) is also equipped with a topological space structure (the usual intended one is the subspace topology).
- `def is_quotient_map {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) : Prop := Function.Surjective f ∧ ∀ U : Set Y, IsOpen U ↔ IsOpen (f ⁻¹' U)`: This defines “f is a quotient map” as: f is surjective and a set U in Y is open if and only if its preimage under f is open in X. This matches a standard equivalent definition of quotient maps.
- `theorem retraction_is_quotient (r : X → Subtype A) (hr_cont : Continuous r) (hr_id : ∀ a : Subtype A, r a = a) : is_quotient_map r := by sorry`: If r is a map from X to A (modeled as `Subtype A`), r is continuous, and for every a in A we have r(a) = a (i.e., r ∘ inclusion = id on A), then r is a quotient map according to the above definition.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement defines a retraction r: X → A with r(a)=a for each a ∈ A and asks to show that a retraction is a quotient map. The Lean code encodes A as `Subtype A`, requires r: X → Subtype A, assumes continuity of r and the retraction property `∀ a : Subtype A, r a = a`, and concludes that r is a quotient map in the sense of surjectivity plus “open iff preimage open.” This is exactly the standard theorem.
- The definition of quotient map used (surjective and U open in codomain iff preimage is open in domain) is standard and faithful.
- Using `Subtype A` to model the subset A is the canonical formalization of A ⊆ X. The property `r a = a` for all `a : Subtype A` is precisely the formal version of “r(a) = a for each a ∈ A,” relying on the coercion from `Subtype A` to X.
- Continuity is assumed in the hypotheses (hr_cont), consistent with the natural definition of retraction. The conclusion does not mention continuity because their quotient map definition already implies continuity, which is fine.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem states exactly that a retraction (continuous r with r|_A = id) is a quotient map. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `is_quotient_map` is a legitimate, standard definition. The objects and hypotheses align with the natural language statement. There are no mismatches in domains/codomains or properties.
- Minor technical note: the instance `[TopologicalSpace (Subtype A)]` is standard in Mathlib and represents the subspace topology, which is what one expects for A ⊆ X. This matches the usual context for retractions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- The theorem:
  `theorem connected_iff_stone_cech_connected (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] [CompletelyRegularSpace X] : ConnectedSpace X ↔ ConnectedSpace (StoneCech X) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a type X equipped with a topology and assumed to be a completely regular space, X is connected if and only if its Stone–Čech compactification StoneCech X is connected.
  There are no auxiliary definitions; `StoneCech`, `ConnectedSpace`, and `CompletelyRegularSpace` are standard Mathlib notions.

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
- Original: ""Let X be completely regular. Show that X is connected iff the Stone-Čech compactification of X is connected.""
- Lean: Exactly states the equivalence `ConnectedSpace X ↔ ConnectedSpace (StoneCech X)` under the assumption `[CompletelyRegularSpace X]` and `[TopologicalSpace X]` for a given type `X`.
- This is a faithful formalization of the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra or missing hypotheses: The natural language assumes X is completely regular; the Lean code has `[CompletelyRegularSpace X]` and the necessary `[TopologicalSpace X]` structure.
- The conclusion matches: ""X is connected iff Stone–Čech(X) is connected"" corresponds to `ConnectedSpace X ↔ ConnectedSpace (StoneCech X)`.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

- `theorem Munkres_exercise_31_2 {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [NormalSpace X] {s t : Set X}`: We are in a type X equipped with a topology, and X is assumed to be a normal space. We consider two subsets s, t of X.
- Hypotheses `(hs : IsClosed s) (ht : IsClosed t) (hdis : Disjoint s t)`: s and t are closed sets and are disjoint.
- Conclusion: `∃ U V : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V ∧ s ⊆ U ∧ t ⊆ V ∧ Disjoint (closure U) (closure V)`: There exist sets U and V that are open, with s ⊆ U and t ⊆ V (so U and V are open neighborhoods of s and t), and the closures of U and V are disjoint.
- `by sorry`: proof omitted; we only audit the statement.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
Natural language: ""Show that if X is normal, every pair of disjoint closed sets have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint."" This means: In a normal space X, for any disjoint closed sets s and t, there exist neighborhoods U and V of s and t respectively such that cl(U) and cl(V) are disjoint. In usual topology usage, “neighborhoods” here can be taken to be open neighborhoods, and the Lean statement explicitly requires U, V to be open.

The Lean theorem matches this precisely: it assumes X is normal, s and t are disjoint closed sets, and concludes the existence of open U, V with s ⊆ U, t ⊆ V and Disjoint (closure U) (closure V).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Assumptions: Normal space, disjoint closed sets — match.
- Conclusion: Existence of open neighborhoods containing the sets, with disjoint closures — matches the natural language. Using `Disjoint (closure U) (closure V)` is equivalent to saying the closures are disjoint.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. No extra or missing conditions.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement directly matches the natural language claim: S^1 is the usual unit circle (as a subspace of R^2), f is continuous S^1 → R, and there exists x with f(x)=f(−x).

",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- Context: We work over the real numbers. Let a, b ∈ ℝ and f : ℝ → ℝ.
- Hypotheses:
  • h_diff : f is differentiable on the open interval Ioo a b = (a, b).
  • h_pos : for every x ∈ (a, b), the (unary) derivative deriv f x satisfies deriv f x > 0.
- Conclusion:
  • StrictMonoOn f (Ioo a b): f is strictly increasing on (a, b).
  • DifferentiableOn ℝ (Function.invFun f) (f '' Ioo a b): the function invFun f (a globally defined choice of a preimage for each y) is differentiable on the subset f((a, b)).
  • ∀ x ∈ (a, b), deriv (Function.invFun f) (f x) = (deriv f x)⁻¹: for each x in (a, b), the standard derivative (as a function on ℝ) of invFun f at the point f(x) equals the reciprocal of f'(x).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If f'(x) > 0 on (a, b), then f is strictly increasing on (a, b). Let g be its inverse function (defined on f((a, b))). Prove g is differentiable and g'(f(x)) = 1 / f'(x) for a < x < b.
- Agreement:
  • The Lean statement correctly assumes differentiability on (a, b) and positivity of the derivative there, and concludes f is strictly increasing on (a, b).
  • It also aims to assert differentiability of the inverse on f((a, b)) and the reciprocal derivative identity.
- Key discrepancies:
  • Use of Function.invFun f instead of the genuine inverse g of the restriction of f to (a, b). invFun f is a global, choice-based right-inverse on the range, not necessarily the inverse of f|(a,b). For y ∈ f((a, b)), invFun f y can pick any preimage of y, possibly lying outside (a, b), if such exists. Thus, the function being differentiated in the Lean statement need not coincide near y with the true inverse of the restriction f|(a,b). This is a substantial deviation from “let g be its inverse function.”
  • The derivative in the Lean statement is deriv (Function.invFun f) (f x), i.e., the standard derivative in ℝ at f(x), not the derivative within the subset f((a, b)). Since invFun f is arbitrary off f((a, b)), its behavior near f(x) along directions not lying in f((a, b)) can affect the existence/value of the derivative. The natural statement considers g defined on the open interval f((a,b)), so its derivative is taken in its (open) domain, not via an arbitrary extension to ℝ.
  • The code does not assert that invFun f agrees with the inverse on a neighborhood of f(x), nor that f is globally injective, so the derivative identity as stated for invFun f can fail even if the classical inverse theorem holds for the true inverse.

3) Final comparison:
- The intended mathematics: the derivative formula is for the true inverse g : f((a, b)) → (a, b). The Lean code asserts the formula for Function.invFun f, a potentially different function near f(x). This is not just a technicality; it changes the function whose differentiability and derivative are being claimed, and can be false without extra hypotheses. Also, the use of deriv (not derivWithin) demands differentiability as a function on ℝ at f(x), which is stronger than the inverse’s differentiability on its open domain and depends on the arbitrary extension.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Given these issues, although the premises and the high-level goals align, the choice of invFun and the use of the global derivative make the formal statement meaningfully different from the intended one.

- The theorem `Munkres_exercise_23_4 {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α] ... : ConnectedSpace α` says: For a type α equipped with a topology, if (i) every open set is exactly either the empty set or has finite complement (expressed as `h_top : ∀ s : Set α, IsOpen s ↔ s = ∅ ∨ (sᶜ).Finite`), i.e., the topology is the cofinite topology, and (ii) the underlying set α is infinite (expressed as `hinf : (univ : Set α).Infinite`), then α is a connected space (`ConnectedSpace α`). The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but our task concerns the statement, not the proof.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Show that if X is an infinite set, it is connected in the finite complement topology.""
- Lean: Assumes the topology on α is the finite-complement (cofinite) topology (`h_top`) and that α is infinite (`hinf`), and concludes that α is connected (`ConnectedSpace α`).
- This matches exactly: the topology is specified to be cofinite via the open set characterization, and the conclusion is that the space is connected when the underlying set is infinite.

Final check for differences:
- No extraneous hypotheses are added beyond specifying the cofinite topology and infinitude of the underlying set.
- The conclusion ""ConnectedSpace α"" precisely corresponds to ""X is connected"" in that topology.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; `h_top` is a legitimate assumption characterizing the cofinite topology. The use of `∅` in the equivalence is standard because in the cofinite topology ∅ is open even when its complement is infinite.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Grade justification:
- The translation is exact and uses standard Mathlib notions; no mismatches or vacuous constructs.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""Show that X is countably compact iff every nested sequence C1 ⊇ C2 ⊇ ⋯ of closed nonempty sets of X has a nonempty intersection."" 
- The Lean definition of countably compact matches the standard notion: every countable open cover has a finite subcover.

Indexing from ℕ (starting at 0) instead of 1 is an inessential cosmetic difference.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `IsCountablyCompact` is properly defined, and the theorem statement is exactly the equivalence in the natural language.
- The use of ℕ-indexed sequences and the exact formulation of finite subcover via unions over a Finset are standard and faithful technical formalizations.
- No extra assumptions or omissions: closedness, nestedness, nonemptiness of each C n, and nonempty intersection are all present.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses the Mathlib library.
- Comment block: States the exercise: If every vector is an eigenvector of a linear map T, then T is a scalar multiple of the identity.
- `variable {K : Type _} [Field K]`: K is a field.
- `variable {V : Type _} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]`: V is a K-vector space (an additive commutative group with a K-module structure).
- `open LinearMap`: Opens the namespace for linear maps.
- Theorem statement: `theorem Axler_exercise_5_12 (T : V →ₗ[K] V) (h : ∀ v : V, ∃ (c : K), T v = c • v) : ∃ c : K, T = c • LinearMap.id := by sorry`.
  - This says: Let T be a K-linear map from V to itself. Suppose that for every vector v in V, there exists a scalar c (which may depend on v) such that T v = c • v. Then there exists a scalar c such that T equals c times the identity linear map (i.e., T = c • id).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Suppose T ∈ L(V) is such that every vector in V is an eigenvector of T. Prove that T is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.""
- Lean hypothesis `∀ v, ∃ c, T v = c • v` captures “every (nonzero) vector is an eigenvector” except it includes v = 0. Including v = 0 does not alter the content, since the equation holds trivially for v = 0 for any c. So the Lean statement is at least as strong and effectively equivalent in this context.
- Conclusion `∃ c, T = c • LinearMap.id` exactly matches “T is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib ones. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is allowed per the auditing instructions.

Final check: The math problems are the same. The only subtlety is the inclusion of v = 0 in the quantification, which is harmless and standard in formalizations. The code is a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `X` is a type with a topology `[TopologicalSpace X]` and is Hausdorff `[T2Space X]`. A point `x : X` is fixed.
- Hypothesis `h_loc`: There exists a set `W ⊆ X` such that `W` is open, `x ∈ W`, and `closure W` is compact. The comment explicitly says this is how they choose to express “locally compact at x.”
- Goal (theorem statement): For every `U : Set X` with `IsOpen U` and `x ∈ U`, there exists a set `V : Set X` such that `IsOpen V`, `x ∈ V`, `IsCompact (closure V)`, and `closure V ⊆ U`.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “If X is Hausdorff and locally compact at x, then for each neighborhood U of x, there is a neighborhood V of x with compact closure and whose closure is contained in U.”
- Hausdorff: matched by `[T2Space X]`.
- “Neighborhood” use: The code requires `U` to be open and contain `x` (an open neighborhood). In many texts a neighborhood need not be open, but requiring openness is a harmless specialization: if the conclusion holds for all open neighborhoods, it also holds for all neighborhoods by choosing an open subset of the given neighborhood.
- Locally compact at x: The code models this as the existence of some open neighborhood with compact closure. This is a standard and acceptable formulation for “locally compact at x” in the Hausdorff context, and in fact the theorem’s conclusion is precisely the strengthened form “for each neighborhood U...”. This matches the intended exercise (Munkres 29.10) where one shows that in a Hausdorff space, the existence of a relatively compact neighborhood implies the for-all-U shrinking property.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions: The code uses standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsCompact, closure, T2Space) and introduces no placeholders. The proof is omitted, but that does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem statement faithfully represents the mathematical claim: Given Hausdorff and locally compact at x (as existence of some open with compact closure), for every neighborhood U of x (taken to be open), there is an open neighborhood V of x with compact closure contained in U. This is essentially identical to the natural language statement, with only the benign specialization to open neighborhoods, which is standard and does not change the meaning.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- lower_limit_basis: the collection of all half-open intervals [a,b) with a < b in ℝ (Set.Ico a b). This matches the usual basis for the lower limit (Sorgenfrey) topology.
- lower_limit_topology: the topology on ℝ generated from that collection. Since [a,b) sets are closed under finite intersections, generateFrom produces the intended topology.
- K_set: K = {1/(n+1) | n ∈ ℕ}, i.e., {1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}, the usual K in the K-topology. This is equivalent to {1/n | n ≥ 1}.
- K_basis: sets that are either open intervals (a,b) or (a,b) \ K_set, for any a < b. This is a standard way to present the K-topology: the topology generated by these two families. Although some presentations restrict the (a,b) \ K part to intervals containing 0, the version here (allowing all a<b) is equivalent: if 0 ∈ (c,d) and (a,b) ⊆ (c,d), then (a,b) \ K = (a,b) ∩ ((c,d) \ K). Since both (a,b) and (c,d) \ K are in the generating family, (a,b) \ K is open in the generated topology even if one only assumed (c,d) \ K with 0 ∈ (c,d). Thus the definition is faithful.
- K_topology: the topology on ℝ generated by K_basis.
- Theorem lower_limit_and_K_not_comparable: There exists U open in the lower limit topology but not open in the K-topology, and there exists V open in the K-topology but not open in the lower limit topology. This is exactly the formal statement that the two topologies are not comparable (neither is finer than the other).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to show ℝ_l and ℝ_K are not comparable. The Lean theorem asserts exactly this via the standard existential characterization: each topology has an open set not open in the other.
- The definitions of ℝ_l and ℝ_K are faithful and standard. No placeholders or vacuous definitions are used. The use of generateFrom is appropriate.
- Minor definitional choices (using 1/(n+1) instead of 1/n, and allowing (a,b) \ K for all intervals) are standard and equivalent.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Axler_exercise_1_8 {R : Type _} {V : Type _} [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid V] [Module R V] {ι : Type _} (S : ι → Submodule R V) : ∃ (W : Submodule R V), (W : Set V) = ⋂ i, (S i : Set V)`
  This states: For any semiring R, any additive commutative monoid V with an R-module structure, and any family S indexed by ι of submodules of V, there exists a submodule W of V whose underlying set equals the intersection over all i of the underlying sets of S i. In other words, the intersection of any collection of submodules is itself the underlying set of some submodule (namely W), i.e., it is a submodule.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: ""Prove that the intersection of any collection of subspaces of V is a subspace of V."" The Lean statement asserts the existence of a submodule W whose carrier set equals the intersection of the carriers of the given family of submodules. This is exactly the formal way to express that the intersection is a submodule. Thus it is faithful.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean version is slightly more general: it works for modules over a semiring (Submodule R V) rather than just vector spaces over a field. This is an acceptable and standard generalization.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib's Submodule and set-theoretic intersection. The presence of `sorry` is fine per the auditing instructions, since we only check the statement/translation, not the proof.
- It also correctly handles any index type ι, including the empty index set; the intersection over an empty family is the universal set, which corresponds to the top submodule, consistent with the statement.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def U : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := { p | ∃ (m n : Int), p = (↑m, ↑n) }`
  This defines U as the set of all pairs of real numbers that are integer lattice points: U = {(m, n) : m, n ∈ ℤ} inside ℝ × ℝ (i.e., ℝ^2).

- `theorem Axler_exercise_1_6 : U.Nonempty ∧ (∀ a b, a ∈ U → b ∈ U → a + b ∈ U) ∧ (∀ a, a ∈ U → -a ∈ U) ∧ ¬ (∀ (r : ℝ) (v : ℝ × ℝ), v ∈ U → r • v ∈ U) := by sorry`
  This theorem asserts four properties about U:
  • U.Nonempty: U is nonempty.
  • ∀ a b, a ∈ U → b ∈ U → a + b ∈ U: U is closed under addition.
  • ∀ a, a ∈ U → -a ∈ U: U is closed under additive inverses.
  • ¬ (∀ r v, v ∈ U → r • v ∈ U): It is not the case that U is closed under scalar multiplication by all real numbers; i.e., there exists some real r and some v ∈ U such that r • v ∉ U.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks for an example of a nonempty subset U of ℝ^2 that is closed under addition and additive inverses but is not a subspace. The code picks U = ℤ × ℤ ⊆ ℝ^2, proves (to be proved) it is nonempty, closed under addition and negation, and explicitly states that it is not closed under all real scalar multiplications, which suffices to conclude U is not a subspace. This exactly matches the intent: providing a concrete example meeting the closure properties but failing the subspace property.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Uses ℝ × ℝ rather than a vector notation ℝ^2; these are equivalent in mathlib and in standard math.
- ""Not a subspace"" is captured by failure of closure under all scalar multiplication. This is a standard sufficient condition and matches the intention. The statement doesn’t explicitly say ""¬Submodule"" but demonstrating failure of a necessary axiom is faithful to ""not a subspace."" There are no vacuous definitions or placeholders beyond an unproved theorem (allowed per instructions). No extraneous or misleading auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the requested example and properties.

  This states: It is not the case that there exist integers x and y such that 7*x^3 + 2 = y^3. In other words, the Diophantine equation 7x^3 + 2 = y^3 has no integer solutions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to show that the equation 7 x^3 + 2 = y^3 has no solution in integers. The Lean statement asserts ¬ ∃ (x y : Int), 7 * x ^ 3 + 2 = y ^ 3, which is exactly the formal negation of the existence of integer solutions (with both x and y in Int). This matches perfectly.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of Int for integers and the polynomial equation is direct and standard. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this task since we are auditing the translation, not the proof.

  This states: For any natural number n, assuming h: n mod 2 = 1 (i.e., n is odd), then 8 divides n^2 - 1. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but that does not affect the statement's faithfulness.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The Lean code uses natural numbers `Nat`. The natural language did not explicitly specify integers vs naturals. The statement is standard over naturals, and the result holds equally for integers, so restricting to naturals is a typical, acceptable specialization. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's definitions and theorems.
- The theorem `axler_exercise_5_4` assumes: a field `F`, a vector space `V` over `F` (`[AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]`), and linear operators `S T : V →ₗ[F] V` that commute, expressed as `h : S.comp T = T.comp S` (i.e., S ∘ T = T ∘ S).
- The goal states: For every scalar `c : F` and vector `v : V`, if `(T - c • id) v = 0` then `(T - c • id) (S v) = 0`.
  Here, `T - c • (LinearMap.id : V →ₗ[F] V)` denotes the operator T − cI. The statement thus says that whenever v is in ker(T − cI), then S v is also in ker(T − cI), i.e., S maps the kernel of T − cI into itself.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If S and T commute, then for every λ ∈ F, the null space ker(T − λI) is invariant under S. This is exactly S(ker(T − λI)) ⊆ ker(T − λI) for all λ.
- The Lean statement is precisely the pointwise formulation of this invariance: ∀ c ∈ F, ∀ v, (T − cI) v = 0 → (T − cI) (S v) = 0.
- The commutation condition is faithfully represented by `S.comp T = T.comp S`.
- The objects correspond correctly to L(V) (linear endomorphisms of V), with V a module over field F.

3) Final check of equivalence and discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; no placeholders are used beyond the omitted proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- The statement matches exactly; there is no unintended strengthening or weakening. The quantification over all c: F (λ in the original) is present.
- Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement “infinitely many primes congruent to −1 modulo 6” is exactly captured by requiring primes with remainder 5 upon division by 6, and asserting that set is infinite. Using `Nat.Prime` and `Set.Infinite` is standard. No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- Congruent to −1 mod 6 is equivalent to congruent to 5 mod 6; `p % 6 = 5` captures that precisely for natural numbers.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_6_16 (U : Submodule 𝕜 V) : U.orthogonal = ⊥ ↔ U = ⊤ := by sorry` states: For any subspace U of V (Submodule 𝕜 V), the orthogonal complement of U equals the zero subspace (⊥) if and only if U equals the whole space (⊤). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural statement: Suppose U is a subspace of V. Prove that U^⊥ = {0} iff U = V.
- Lean statement: In a finite-dimensional inner product space (over ℝ or ℂ), for any subspace U, U.orthogonal = ⊥ iff U = ⊤. This uses standard Mathlib notions: `U.orthogonal` is U^⊥, `⊥` is the zero subspace {0}, and `⊤` is V. Thus the formal statement is exactly the same mathematical claim, expressed in Mathlib terminology.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean code adds the assumption that V is finite-dimensional and an inner product space over ℝ or ℂ. The inner product assumption is implicit in the notion of orthogonal complement, and the finite-dimensional assumption is a standard mild specialization ensuring all subspaces are closed so that the equivalence holds without closure issues. This is an acceptable slight specialization and does not distort the intended statement.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement with legitimate Mathlib concepts.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable (V : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup V] [InnerProductSpace Complex V] [FiniteDimensional Complex V]`:
  This declares V to be a complex inner product space (hence a normed additive group and a normed space), and additionally assumes V is finite-dimensional over the complex numbers.
- `theorem Axler_exercise_7_10 (T : V →ₗ[Complex] V)`:
  T is a Complex-linear map on V (a linear operator on V).
- `(h_normal : (T.comp (LinearMap.adjoint T)) = ((LinearMap.adjoint T).comp T))`:
  This is the normality hypothesis: T ∘ T† = T† ∘ T, where `LinearMap.adjoint T` is the adjoint of T.
- `(h_pow : T ^ 9 = T ^ 8)`:
  This asserts the polynomial relation T^9 = T^8.
- Conclusion: `(LinearMap.adjoint T = T) ∧ (T ^ 2 = T)`:
  This states T is self-adjoint (T = T†) and idempotent (T^2 = T).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: V is a complex inner-product space, T is a normal operator, and T^9 = T^8. Prove T is self-adjoint and T^2 = T.
- Lean: Exactly the same properties are assumed and the same conclusions are asserted. The definition of normality used is the standard operator equation T T† = T† T. The conclusions match: self-adjointness and idempotency.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The only difference is that the Lean statement adds `[FiniteDimensional Complex V]`. This is a slight specialization (finite-dimensional complex inner product space) compared to the general statement (which could allow infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces). This is a standard and acceptable specialization for such an exercise and does not change the essence of the problem.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary fake definitions; the theorem statement is genuine.

In Dirichlet-convolution language with the Mathlib convention (f * g)(n) = ∑_{d ∣ n} f(d) g(n/d), the equality μ * log = Λ is equivalent to ∀n, ∑_{d ∣ n} μ(d) log(n/d) = Λ(n). Since the set of divisors is closed under the map d ↦ n/d, this is the same as ∑_{d ∣ n} μ(n/d) log d = Λ(n). Thus the theorem `μ * log = Λ` exactly captures the claimed identity.
- The code relies on Mathlib's standard definitions: μ is the Möbius arithmetic function, log is the (real) logarithm viewed as an arithmetic function, and Λ is the von Mangoldt function. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it simply states the identity as an equality of arithmetic functions.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same. The Lean statement asserts equality of arithmetic functions via Dirichlet convolution which is pointwise the sum formula given, and Λ is defined exactly as in the problem. The small difference in the arrangement of μ(d) log(n/d) versus μ(n/d) log d is immaterial due to the divisor substitution. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Context: `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]` means X is a compact Hausdorff space. This matches the natural language assumption.
- `A : Set (Set X)` is a collection of subsets of X.
- `h_closed : ∀ S ∈ A, IsClosed (S : Set X)` asserts every set in A is closed.
- `h_conn : ∀ S ∈ A, IsConnected (S : Set X)` asserts every set in A is connected (and in mathlib, connected implies nonempty).
- `h_total : ∀ S T, S ∈ A → T ∈ A → S ⊂ T ∨ T ⊂ S` asserts that for any S, T in A, either S is a strict subset of T or T is a strict subset of S. Here `⊂` is strict subset (`ssubset`). This quantification includes the case S = T.
- Conclusion: `IsConnected (⋂ S ∈ A, S)` states that the intersection of all sets in A is connected.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language: ""Let X be a compact Hausdorff space. Let A be a collection of closed connected subsets of X that is simply ordered by proper inclusion. Then Y = ⋂_{A ∈ A} A is connected.""
- The hypotheses about compact Hausdorff, closed, and connected are faithfully captured.
- The ordering condition is problematic. The phrase ""simply ordered by proper inclusion"" in standard usage means: for any two distinct sets S ≠ T in A, either S ⊂ T or T ⊂ S (a chain under inclusion). The Lean code asserts strict comparability for all pairs S, T in A, without the distinctness condition. For S = T, `S ⊂ S` is false, so the Lean hypothesis is impossible for any nonempty A. Thus the Lean condition is strictly stronger than intended and in fact inconsistent with any nonempty family.
- The conclusion matches: the intersection is connected. Mathlib's `IsConnected` includes nonemptiness, which is consistent with the standard theorem (each member is connected hence nonempty; in a compact space, the intersection of a chain of nonempty closed sets is nonempty; so connectedness implies nonempty). That aspect is fine.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Main difference: The Lean hypothesis `h_total` uses strict subset comparability for all pairs, failing for S = T. The natural language (interpreted correctly) either means non-strict inclusion for all pairs (S ⊆ T or T ⊆ S) or strict inclusion only for distinct pairs. The Lean formalization misses the ""distinct"" qualifier or the use of non-strict inclusion.
- Everything else aligns: compact Hausdorff, closed connected sets, intersection, and connected conclusion.

Verdict: Not faithful due to the overly strong and actually inconsistent ordering hypothesis. A faithful formalization would use either `∀ S T ∈ A, S ⊆ T ∨ T ⊆ S` or `∀ S T, S ∈ A → T ∈ A → S ≠ T → (S ⊂ T ∨ T ⊂ S)`.

  - `(hq : Nat.Prime q)` means q is a prime.
  - `(hpq : p ≠ q)` means p and q are distinct.

  - `(hdiv : p - 1 ∣ q - 1)` asserts p−1 divides q−1.
  - `(hcop : Nat.gcd n (p * q) = 1)` asserts gcd(n, pq) = 1.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural statement: Let p and q be distinct odd primes with p−1 | q−1. If (n, pq) = 1, show n^{q−1} ≡ 1 (mod pq).
- The Lean statement exactly encodes: p, q primes, distinct, both ≠ 2 (odd), p − 1 ∣ q − 1, gcd(n, pq) = 1, and the conclusion is the divisibility form of the desired congruence modulo pq.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; no mismatches in quantifiers or domains. The coercions to integers in the conclusion are standard and faithful to the congruence statement.
- The extra hypotheses match the natural statement (oddness explicitly included). The divisibility statement is equivalent to the congruence.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same in mathematical content. There are no extraneous or missing conditions. The formulation in Lean is a standard formalization of the given statement.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_33_8 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [CompletelyRegularSpace X]`: Let X be a topological space and assume X is completely regular (in Mathlib's sense).
- `{A B : Set X} (hA : IsCompact A) (hB : IsClosed B) (hdisj : Disjoint A B)`: Let A and B be subsets of X with A compact, B closed, and A and B disjoint.
- `∃ f : X → ℝ, Continuous f ∧ (f '' A = {0}) ∧ (f '' B = {1}) ∧ (∀ x, f x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)`: There exists a function f : X → ℝ that is continuous, maps A exactly to {0} and B exactly to {1}, and whose values lie in the interval [0,1] for all x (i.e., the range of f is contained in [0,1]).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: X is completely regular; A and B are disjoint closed subsets; if A is compact, there exists a continuous f : X → [0,1] with f(A) = {0} and f(B) = {1}.
- The Lean statement assumes: X completely regular; A compact; B closed; A and B disjoint. It concludes existence of a continuous f : X → ℝ whose image lies in [0,1], with f '' A = {0} and f '' B = {1}.
- Using f : X → ℝ plus the condition ∀ x, f x ∈ Icc 0 1 is a standard formalization of f : X → [0,1]. The equalities `f '' A = {0}` and `f '' B = {1}` match the requirement that f maps A constantly to 0 and B constantly to 1, and also (as in the natural language) implicitly force A and B to be nonempty if the statement is to hold.

Comparison and differences:
- The Lean code does not assume A is closed; it only assumes A is compact. The natural statement assumes both A and B are closed and, in addition, A is compact. The Lean version is a slight generalization (weaker assumptions), which is acceptable per the guidelines.
- Everything else matches: completely regular space, disjointness, continuous f with values in [0,1], and the exact images on A and B.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all concepts are from Mathlib, and there are no auxiliary fake definitions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful (slightly more general) formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in mathlib; no mathematical content change.
- Comment: States the exercise: If a prime p divides x^4 - x^2 + 1 (x integer), then p ≡ 1 (mod 12).
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_5_13 (p : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) (x : ℤ) (h : (p : ℤ) ∣ (x ^ 4 - x ^ 2 + 1)) : p % 12 = 1 := by sorry`
  This declares: For any natural number p with `p.Prime`, and any integer x, if (p : ℤ) divides the integer x^4 - x^2 + 1, then `p % 12 = 1`. The divisibility is in ℤ (using coercion `(p : ℤ)`), and the conclusion is the statement that p leaves remainder 1 upon division by 12.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Show that any prime divisor of x^4 − x^2 + 1 is congruent to 1 modulo 12.” This quantifies over integers x and primes p dividing the given integer, concluding p ≡ 1 (mod 12).
- The Lean statement matches this: it universally quantifies over p (a natural prime) and x (an integer), assumes p divides x^4 - x^2 + 1 in ℤ, and concludes `p % 12 = 1`. For natural numbers, `p % 12 = 1` is equivalent to the congruence `p ≡ 1 [MOD 12]` (since 0 ≤ 1 < 12), so the conclusion matches the standard number-theoretic statement.
- Handling of divisibility: Using `(p : ℤ) ∣ (x^4 - x^2 + 1)` accurately captures “p divides x^4 - x^2 + 1” for integer x.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem signature with a `sorry` proof placeholder. This is acceptable under the task criteria.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain match: p is a prime natural number; x is an integer. This aligns with the usual statement (primes are positive integers; x ∈ ℤ).
- Conclusion form: `p % 12 = 1` vs. “p ≡ 1 (mod 12)”. Equivalent for natural p.
- No missing edge cases: The theorem implicitly rules out p = 2 or 3 by the conclusion; the hypothesis does not require excluding them explicitly (and indeed 2,3 never divide x^4 - x^2 + 1), so there’s no mismatch.
- Scope: The theorem is universally quantified over x as in the natural statement.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to show ∫_{−∞}^{∞} cos x / (x^2 + a^2) dx = π e^{−a} / a for a > 0. The Lean statement asserts exactly this equality, using the Lebesgue integral over ℝ (which matches the improper integral here), with the same condition a > 0, and the same right-hand side written as π * exp(−a) / a.

3) Final check:
- Domains/assumptions: both require a > 0.
- Integral: over the whole real line; Lean uses Lebesgue integral `∫ x : ℝ`, which is the standard formalization and equivalent here.
- Expression equality: π e^{−a} / a matches `π * exp (-a) / a`.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is: “Show that 2 is divisible by (1+i)^2 in ℤ[i].” This means: there exists a Gaussian integer z (i.e., z = a + bi with a, b ∈ ℤ) such that 2 = (1+i)^2 · z. 
- The Lean statement asserts the existence of integers a, b with 2 = (a + b i) · (1 + i)^2. Since multiplication in ℂ (and in ℤ[i]) is commutative, this is equivalent to 2 = (1 + i)^2 · (a + b i). Hence it captures exactly the divisibility statement (1 + i)^2 ∣ 2 in ℤ[i].
- The use of ℂ rather than an explicit Gaussian integer type is fine because the witness is constrained to have integer real and imaginary parts, and both factors are Gaussian integers; equality in ℂ coincides with equality in ℤ[i] under the standard embedding.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the task (we are only auditing the statement, not the proof).

- `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1) ↔ ∀ q : ℕ, q.Prime → q ∣ (p - 1) → a ^ ((p - 1) / q) ≠ (1 : ZMod p)` asserts the equivalence: a is a primitive (p − 1)-th root of unity in ZMod p if and only if for every prime q dividing p − 1, one has a^((p − 1)/q) ≠ 1 in ZMod p. This matches the congruence formulation “a^{(p-1)/q} \not\equiv 1 (mod p)”.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let p be an odd prime. Show that a is a primitive root modulo p iff a^{(p-1)/q} ≠ 1 (mod p) for all prime divisors q of p-1.” Typically, in number theory, “a is a primitive root modulo p” implicitly means a is considered modulo p and is coprime to p (i.e., a ∈ (Z/pZ)^×). In the prime modulus case, this just means a ≠ 0 (mod p).
- The Lean statement quantifies over arbitrary `a : ZMod p` without assuming `a ≠ 0` or `a ∈ (ZMod p)ˣ`. On the left side, `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` ensures a has multiplicative order p − 1, which in particular forces a ≠ 0. On the right side, however, the condition `∀ q | (p - 1), a^((p - 1)/q) ≠ 1` is satisfied even when a = 0 (since 0^k = 0 for k > 0), making the right side true while the left side false for a = 0. Thus the equivalence, as stated for all `a : ZMod p`, is not correct.
- To be faithful, one should either assume `a ≠ 0` (or `a ∈ (ZMod p)ˣ`) or work with `a : (ZMod p)ˣ`. With that adjustment, the Lean statement would match the natural language statement.
- Everything else (odd prime assumption, prime divisors q of p − 1, the exponent (p − 1)/q using division under the divisibility hypothesis, and the interpretation of “≠ 1 (mod p)” as inequality in ZMod p) is appropriate and faithful.

3) Final comparison:
- Difference found: missing the implicit unit/nonzero hypothesis on `a`. Because of this, the Lean statement claims an equivalence for all `a : ZMod p`, which fails when `a = 0` (RHS true, LHS false). Aside from this, the translation is spot-on.

Overall: Almost faithful except for the crucial missing nonzero/unit condition on `a`.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_4_4 (p : Polynomial Complex) (m : ℕ) (hp : p.natDegree = m) : ... := by sorry`
  Hypotheses: p is a polynomial over ℂ; m is a natural number; hp asserts that the (natural) degree of p, `p.natDegree`, equals m.
  Conclusion: `(p.roots.toFinset.card = m) ↔ (∀ z : Complex, Polynomial.eval z p = 0 → Polynomial.eval z (Polynomial.derivative p) ≠ 0)`
  • Left side: `p.roots` is the multiset of roots (with multiplicities) of p over ℂ; `toFinset` removes multiplicities; `card` counts distinct roots. So this says: the number of distinct complex roots of p is m.
  • Right side: For every complex number z, if z is a root of p (i.e. `eval z p = 0`), then z is not a root of p' (i.e. `eval z (derivative p) ≠ 0`). This encodes “p and its derivative have no common roots.”

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: “Suppose p ∈ P(ℂ) has degree m. Prove that p has m distinct roots iff p and p' have no roots in common.”
- The Lean hypothesis `hp : p.natDegree = m` formalizes “p has degree m.” The left side formalizes “p has m distinct roots.” The right side formalizes “p and p' have no roots in common.”
- The ambient field ℂ matches the statement.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Primary subtlety: In standard mathematics, “degree m” is typically only defined for nonzero polynomials. In Mathlib, `natDegree` is defined for all polynomials and equals 0 for the zero polynomial. Thus the Lean statement includes the case p = 0 with m = 0, which the natural language statement would normally exclude. This is a slight mismatch in the domain of discourse.
- Additionally, Mathlib’s `roots` for p = 0 is the empty multiset, so `p.roots.toFinset.card = 0` holds, which does not reflect the intuitive fact that the zero polynomial has infinitely many roots. However, since the natural language statement usually excludes the zero polynomial via “degree m,” this discrepancy arises only from the choice of `natDegree` without an explicit `p ≠ 0` assumption.
- Apart from this zero-polynomial edge case, the formalization precisely matches the intended equivalence for complex polynomials of degree m.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful, with a minor caveat about including the zero polynomial via `natDegree = m` (m = 0) that the natural language typically excludes. Everything else matches well, and no vacuous placeholders are used.

- `theorem Axler_exercise_6_7 (u v : E) : ...`: For all `u v : E`, the inner product `Inner.inner ℂ u v` equals
  `(Complex.ofReal (‖u + v‖ ^ 2) - Complex.ofReal (‖u - v‖ ^ 2)
    + Complex.I * Complex.ofReal (‖u + (Complex.I : ℂ) • v‖ ^ 2)
    - Complex.I * Complex.ofReal (‖u - (Complex.I : ℂ) • v‖ ^ 2)) / (4 : ℂ)`.
This matches the standard complex polarization identity syntactically: the norms are real and are coerced to complex via `Complex.ofReal`, and the terms with `I` match the `i`-multipliers in the usual formula. Scalar multiplication by `i` is written `(Complex.I : ℂ) • v`.

2) Does this faithfully state the natural language theorem?
- The mathematical content of the equation matches the polarization identity.
- However, the natural language hypothesis is: ""V is a complex inner-product space"". In Mathlib, this is expressed by the typeclass `[InnerProductSpace ℂ E]`, which entails that the norm on E is the one induced by the inner product (and is a genuine norm). The Lean code instead assumes only `[SeminormedAddCommGroup E]` and `[Inner ℂ E]` separately, with no requirement that the seminorm is induced by the inner product (or even that it is a norm). Thus the `‖·‖` used on the right-hand side is the seminorm coming from `[SeminormedAddCommGroup E]`, not necessarily the one determined by the inner product. The polarization identity requires compatibility between the norm and the inner product.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly stronger (and, in general, false) unless an additional assumption ties the norm to the inner product. The faithful formalization should use `[InnerProductSpace ℂ E]` and then the `‖·‖` is the inner-product norm. So the environment hypotheses are not faithful to the natural language statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The equation itself is the same.
- The structural assumptions differ in an essential way: the code does not assert that E is an inner product space in the Mathlib sense; it only posits an inner product and an unrelated seminorm. Hence the translation is not faithful.

No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced, and there are no placeholders besides the proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task. The mismatch is solely in the typeclass assumptions.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open ZMod`: We work in Mathlib and use the ring of integers modulo p, ZMod p.
- `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_4_5 {p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (hmod4 : p % 4 = 3) {a : ZMod p} (ha : a ≠ 0) : IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1) ↔ IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) ((p - 1) / 2) := by sorry`
  - Let p be a natural number that is prime (`hp : p.Prime`).
  - Assume p ≡ 3 (mod 4) (`hmod4 : p % 4 = 3`), i.e., p is of the form 4t+3 by the division algorithm.
  - Let a be an element of ZMod p (integers modulo p), with the nonzeroness assumption `ha : a ≠ 0` (so a is a unit in the multiplicative group of ZMod p, appropriate for discussing primitive roots).
  - The statement is an equivalence: `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` ↔ `IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) ((p - 1) / 2)`.
    - In Mathlib, `IsPrimitiveRoot x n` for an element x in a monoid means x has multiplicative order exactly n (equivalently, x is a primitive n-th root of unity). In the context of ZMod p (p prime), the multiplicative group of nonzero elements has order p - 1, so `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` means “a is a primitive root modulo p.”
    - Likewise, `IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) ((p - 1) / 2)` means “−a has multiplicative order (p − 1)/2.”

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement: For prime p of the form 4t+3, show that a is a primitive root modulo p iff −a has order (p−1)/2.
- The Lean statement precisely encodes this:
  - p prime and p ≡ 3 mod 4 matches “p of the form 4t+3.”
  - a is treated as an element modulo p (ZMod p), with nonzero assumption (implicit in the natural language since primitive roots are units modulo p; this is a harmless, natural technical assumption).
  - “a is a primitive root modulo p” is represented as `IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1)` in the multiplicative structure of ZMod p.
  - “−a has order (p − 1)/2” is represented as `IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) ((p - 1) / 2)`; in Mathlib, being a primitive n-th root is equivalent to having multiplicative order n in this context.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated with `sorry` (no proof), which is allowed for the purpose of translation checking.

Final check:
- The Lean code and the natural language statement are essentially the same mathematical statement. The only extra hypothesis is `a ≠ 0`, which is standard and does not change the meaning, since the notion of a primitive root modulo p requires a to be a unit. Thus the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Real` just bring in the necessary libraries and notations (e.g., π, log, sin) for real analysis.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_3_9 : (∫ x in (0:ℝ)..1, log (sin (π * x))) = -log 2 := by sorry`
  reads in natural language as: ""The integral from 0 to 1 of log(sin(π x)) dx equals −log 2."" Here, `(0:ℝ)..1` denotes the interval [0,1] in ℝ for the interval integral; `log` is the natural logarithm on ℝ; `π` is the real constant pi; `sin` is the real sine function; and the integrand is exactly `log (sin (π * x))`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: Show that ∫_0^1 log(sin π x) dx = − log 2.
- The Lean statement matches this precisely: same domain [0,1], same integrand log(sin(π x)), same result −log 2. Real.log is the natural logarithm, matching typical usage of log in this context.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is about translation, not proof.
- No differences in meaning: both assert the identical real-valued integral identity.

  - 𝕜 is a scalar field, assumed to be ℝ or ℂ (via [RCLike 𝕜] and [IsROrC 𝕜]).
  - E is a 𝕜-inner product space, finite-dimensional.
  - T is a 𝕜-linear map from E to E.
  - h_normal asserts normality: T ∘ T* = T* ∘ T, where T* is LinearMap.adjoint T.
  - The conclusion is LinearMap.range T = LinearMap.range (LinearMap.adjoint T), i.e., range T = range T*.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “If T ∈ L(V) is normal, then range T = range T*.” This presumes V is an inner product space (since adjoint T* is used). In Axler’s context, V is finite-dimensional (and typically over ℂ, though ℝ also works). The Lean code explicitly assumes E is a finite-dimensional inner product space over ℝ or ℂ, which aligns with the standard setting and is a standard, acceptable formalization.
- The hypothesis in Lean exactly encodes normality via T ∘ T* = T* ∘ T.
- The conclusion in Lean is exactly the desired equality of ranges.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is allowed per the task since we only check translation of the statement.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement in the standard finite-dimensional inner product space context. The slight explicitness (finite-dimensional, ℝ/ℂ) matches typical textbook assumptions for this result. Therefore, the translation passes.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The hypothesis `(n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n)` exactly encodes “for each positive integer n”.

- The universal quantification is captured by the theorem taking arbitrary `n` and hypothesis `hn` (curried form of ∀ n > 0, ...).

3) Final check / discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The use of natural number subtraction `- 1` is appropriate since for n > 0 the sum is certainly ≥ 1, matching the intended integer expression.
- Parentheses and precedence match the intended nesting of exponents.

  This states: For a complex number z with |z| = 1, the series with general term z^(n+1)/((n+1)^2) (n ranging over natural numbers starting at 0) is summable. Equivalently, the series ∑_{n≥1} z^n / n^2 converges.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the power series ∑ z^n / n^2 converges at every point of the unit circle.""
- The Lean theorem asserts that for any z with |z| = 1, the series ∑_{n≥1} z^n / n^2 is summable (convergent) in ℂ. The shift `(n+1)` enforces starting at n = 1, which matches the natural language intent (since the term at n = 0 would be 1/0^2 and is not part of the series). The condition `Complex.abs z = 1` precisely encodes ""z is on the unit circle."" The type `Summable` expresses convergence of the complex series.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement exactly captures: for every point z on the unit circle, the series ∑_{n≥1} z^n / n^2 converges. There are no extraneous hypotheses, no weakened or strengthened claims, and the index shift is a faithful technical adjustment. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.

Exercise: Suppose that T ∈ L(V) has dim V distinct eigenvalues and that S ∈ L(V)
has the same eigenvectors as T (not necessarily with the same eigenvalues).
Prove that S T = T S.

We formalize the hypothesis by assuming there is a finite index type ι and a
family b : ι → V which is a basis of V (expressed by linear independence and
spanning). We assume T and S act diagonally on this basis: T (b i) = μ i • b i
and S (b i) = ν i • b i. Then S and T commute.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The context fixes a field K, a finite-dimensional K-vector space V, and linear maps T, S : V →ₗ[K] V.
- The hypothesis is an existential statement: there exist a finite index type ι (captured by Fintype ι), a family b : ι → V, and functions μ, ν : ι → K such that:
  • LinearIndependent K (fun i => b i): the family (b i) is linearly independent.
  • Submodule.span K (Set.range b) = ⊤: the family (b i) spans V.
  • ∀ i, T (b i) = μ i • b i: each b i is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue μ i.
  • ∀ i, S (b i) = ν i • b i: each b i is an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue ν i.
  These two conditions together mean b is a basis of common eigenvectors for T and S (i.e., both are diagonal in this basis).
- Conclusion: S.comp T = T.comp S (i.e., ST = TS).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: If T has dim V distinct eigenvalues and S has the same eigenvectors as T (not necessarily same eigenvalues), prove ST = TS.
- Mathematically, “T has dim V distinct eigenvalues” implies that V has a basis of eigenvectors of T (each eigenspace is 1-dimensional and they span V). “S has the same eigenvectors as T” means every eigenvector of T is also an eigenvector of S, so that basis is simultaneously an eigenbasis for both T and S. Therefore, the Lean hypothesis (existence of a common eigenbasis b with T(b i) = μ i b i and S(b i) = ν i b i) precisely captures the effective content needed to conclude ST = TS.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The Lean theorem assumes directly the existence of a common eigenbasis for T and S and concludes they commute. The original hypothesis (distinct eigenvalues for T + S shares all eigenvectors of T) implies the existence of such a common eigenbasis. Thus the Lean statement is a slight generalization: it does not require the eigenvalues of T to be distinct nor that S has all eigenvectors of T; it only requires existence of a common eigenbasis. This is standard and sufficient for the conclusion, and is implied by the original hypotheses.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are standard Mathlib concepts, and the hypothesis is concrete and meaningful.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful in mathematical meaning, with a benign generalization acceptable per the guidelines.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- `noncomputable def Pugh_exercise_2_29 (M : Type _) [MetricSpace M] : { s : Set M // IsOpen s } ≃ { s : Set M // IsClosed s } := by sorry`
  This declares (for any type M equipped with a metric space structure) an equivalence (i.e., a bijection) between the subtype of subsets of M that are open and the subtype of subsets of M that are closed. The equivalence type `≃` in Lean is exactly a bijection. The subtypes `{ s : Set M // IsOpen s }` and `{ s : Set M // IsClosed s }` correspond to the collections T and K, respectively. The body is left as `sorry`, meaning the construction/proof is omitted, but the statement (type) is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: given a metric space M, let T be the collection of open subsets and K the collection of closed subsets; show there is a bijection from T onto K. The code states precisely the existence of a bijection (an equivalence) between the subtype of open sets and the subtype of closed sets in a metric space. This matches perfectly. Using `Equiv` is the standard way to encode a bijection in Lean.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope: The natural language assumes a metric space; the code requires `[MetricSpace M]`. Match.
- Objects: T and K are collections of open/closed sets; the code uses subtypes `{ s : Set M // IsOpen s }` and `{ s : Set M // IsClosed s }`. Match.
- Claim: Existence of a bijection; the code gives an equivalence type. Match.
- No auxiliary fake definitions or placeholders redefining concepts; only the construction is omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable for checking the statement’s faithfulness.
No substantive differences. The formalization is a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators`: bring in mathlib and notation for infinite sums.

  - We fix a sequence of coefficients `c : ℕ → ℕ` and assume each coefficient is either 0 or 1: `hc : ∀ n, c n = 0 ∨ c n = 1`.
  - We assume the infinite series evaluated at x = 2/3 equals 3/2, expressed as `tsum (fun n => (c n : ℝ) * (2/3 : ℝ)^n) = 3/2`.
  - The conclusion states that there does not exist a rational number `q` such that the infinite series evaluated at x = 1/2 equals `q` in ℝ: `¬ ∃ q : ℚ, tsum (fun n => (c n : ℝ) * (1/2 : ℝ)^n) = (q : ℝ)`.
  - This is exactly: f(1/2) is not rational.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines a power series f(x) = ∑ c_i x^i with c_i ∈ {0,1}.
- The code models the coefficients as `c : ℕ → ℕ` with the property `c n = 0 ∨ c n = 1` and uses `tsum` to denote the infinite sum ∑ c(n) x^n over n ≥ 0, evaluated in ℝ.
- The assumption f(2/3) = 3/2 is encoded as the equality of the corresponding `tsum` at x = 2/3.
- The conclusion that f(1/2) is irrational is encoded as the negation of the existence of q : ℚ with f(1/2) = q in ℝ.
- Thus, the formal statement is a faithful rendering of the problem.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only subtlety is that `tsum` is used for the infinite sum in ℝ; this is the standard formalization of a convergent power series value. The equality assumption at 2/3 ensures we are indeed referring to that value. The target statement quantifies over rationals to express irrationality, which is correct.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement. No red flags.
- There is no change of meaning, specialization, or generalization beyond the exact content of the problem.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an accurate and faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Does the whole Lean statement faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language asks: Given a group G with (ab)^3 = a^3 b^3 and (ab)^5 = a^5 b^5 for all a, b, show that G is abelian. The Lean theorem assumes exactly those two universal identities and concludes that all a, b commute, which is precisely the statement that G is abelian.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean version uses standard group notation and natural-number exponentiation in a group, and concludes pairwise commutativity. It does not introduce extra assumptions or weaken the statement. Expressing “G is abelian” as ∀ a b, a*b = b*a is equivalent to the usual notion. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are made.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: T is self-adjoint on V over field 𝔽, ε > 0, and there exists v with ‖v‖ = 1 and ‖T v − λ v‖ < ε. Then T has an eigenvalue λ' with |λ − λ'| < ε.
- Lean statement: Exactly the same, with the standard formalizations: 𝔽 is ℝ or ℂ (IsROrC), E is an inner product space and finite dimensional. Self-adjointness is LinearMap.adjoint T = T. The approximate eigenvector hypothesis and the conclusion about existence of an eigenvalue mu' with abs(mu − mu') < eps are stated verbatim. The eigenvalue is expressed by ∃ w ≠ 0 with T w = mu' • w.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code assumes E is finite-dimensional; the natural language did not explicitly state finite-dimensional, but in the common context (Axler, linear algebra) L(V) usually refers to linear operators on finite-dimensional inner product spaces. This is a slight specialization, acceptable per the guidelines. All other components (self-adjoint, approximate eigenvector, existence of an eigenvalue within ε) match precisely.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `ireland_rosen_exercise_18_4` asserts a conjunction of two statements.
- First conjunct: There exist integers a, b, c, d such that:
  • a^3 + b^3 = 1729 and c^3 + d^3 = 1729 (so two representations of 1729 as a sum of two cubes),
  • a ≠ b and c ≠ d (each representation uses two different integers, hence two different cubes),
  • ¬(a = c ∧ b = d) and ¬(a = d ∧ b = c) (the two representations are genuinely different, not just permutations).
- Second conjunct: For every integer m with 0 < m < 1729, it is not the case that there exist integers a, b, c, d such that:
  • a^3 + b^3 = m and c^3 + d^3 = m,
  • a ≠ b and c ≠ d,
  • and the two pairs are not the same up to order (i.e., ¬(a=c ∧ b=d) and ¬(a=d ∧ b=c)).
This says: no smaller positive integer than 1729 has two distinct representations as a sum of two different integral cubes.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that 1729 is the smallest positive integer expressible as the sum of two different integral cubes in two ways.""
- The first conjunct encodes ""1729 is expressible as the sum of two different integral cubes in two ways"" (two distinct unordered pairs with a ≠ b and c ≠ d).
- The second conjunct encodes ""smallest positive integer"" by forbidding any such two-way representation for all positive m < 1729.
- The code uses Int (integers) for the cubes, which matches ""integral cubes"". It does not require positivity of the summands, which is consistent with the phrasing ""integral"" rather than ""positive""; moreover, the classical examples are positive anyway, and the minimality quantification is over positive m.
- It also correctly avoids counting the same pair in different order as a second way.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The code states exactly the mathematical content: existence of two distinct representations for 1729 and minimality among positive integers.
- It does not require exactly two representations (it asserts existence of two distinct ones), which aligns with the usual meaning of ""in two ways"" (at least two distinct ways), so this is faithful.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; there are no auxiliary definitions. The use of `sorry` is for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This states: For any real number p with p ≤ 1, the series with general term a_n = 1 / ((n+2) * (log(n+2))^p) is not summable (i.e., diverges). The reindexing starts the sum at n = 0 but uses n+2 to ensure the logarithm is well-defined and positive. There is no proof provided (marked by `sorry`), but we are only checking the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: Prove that ∑ 1/[k (log k)^p] diverges when p ≤ 1. Typically the sum is taken from k ≥ 2 to avoid log(1) = 0. The Lean code considers the sequence indexed by n ≥ 0 with terms involving (n+2), which exactly corresponds to the series from k = 2. The use of `Summable` over nonnegative terms is the standard notion of convergence of the series, so ¬ Summable means divergence. The exponent is a real exponent p and the base log(n+2) > 0, so the expression is well-defined for all p ≤ 1, including negative p.
- Thus, the code captures precisely the claim that the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k (log k)^p) diverges for p ≤ 1.

3) Final comparison:
- The only difference is the reindexing n ↦ k = n+2, which is a standard harmless shift. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The mathematical meaning matches exactly: divergence for p ≤ 1.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  - Variables a, p, q are integers.
  - Assumption `ha : a < 0` encodes “a is negative.”
  - Assumption `hmod : ∃ k : Int, p - q = (4 * a) * k` encodes the congruence p ≡ q (mod 4a).
  - Assumption `hp : ¬ (p ∣ a)` encodes “p does not divide a.”
  - Conclusion `quadratic_character a p = quadratic_character a q` claims the quadratic symbols are equal. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The hypotheses a < 0, p ≡ q (mod 4a), and p ∤ a match the given informal conditions.
- The conclusion is meant to be (a/p) = (a/q). The code tries to represent this via `quadratic_character a p`. However, the provided definition `quadratic_character` is completely vacuous (always 0), so the statement becomes trivially true and does not capture the intended meaning of the quadratic/Legendre/Jacobi/Kronecker symbol.
- There is no requirement on p, q (e.g., primality, oddness, coprimality to 2a, etc.). Depending on the intended symbol (Legendre/Jacobi/Kronecker), additional conditions are typically needed, but the natural language statement as provided also omits them. Still, the critical issue is that the symbol is replaced by a constant 0 placeholder, making the theorem contentless.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The core auxiliary definition `quadratic_character` is vacuous and does not represent the actual quadratic symbol; this invalidates the faithfulness of the translation.
  - The proof is omitted; that’s acceptable under the auditing rules, but the vacuous definition is not.
  - The modulus condition is reasonably encoded as an existential `k` with p - q = (4a)k; sign of modulus is acceptable for Int.
  - Potentially missing structural assumptions on p, q for the symbol’s meaning; the natural-language statement is ambiguous, but even granting that ambiguity, the vacuous definition is the main failure.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation because it uses a vacuous placeholder for the quadratic symbol, making the theorem trivial and not reflective of the intended mathematical statement.

  `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_3_22 : ¬ ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), HolomorphicOn f {z | Complex.abs z < 1} ∧ ContinuousOn' f {z | Complex.abs z ≤ 1} ∧ (∀ z, Complex.abs z = 1 → f z = z⁻¹) := by sorry`
  In words: There does not exist a function f: ℂ → ℂ such that (i) f is holomorphic on the open unit disc, (ii) f is continuous on the closed unit disc, and (iii) for every z on the unit circle, f(z) = 1/z. However, because HolomorphicOn and ContinuousOn' are both defined to be True, this reduces to asserting: there does not exist f such that (∀ z with |z|=1, f(z)=1/z). That is a much stronger and in fact false claim, since one can define such an f on ℂ (e.g., piecewise define f to agree with 1/z on the unit circle). The `sorry` means the proof is omitted, but our task is about the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Show that there is no holomorphic function f in the unit disc D that extends continuously to ∂D such that f(z) = 1/z for z ∈ ∂D.""
- Intended formal content: f holomorphic on the open unit disc; f has a continuous extension to the boundary; boundary values satisfy f(ζ)=1/ζ for |ζ|=1; such f does not exist.
- The code’s shape: attempts to express nonexistence of f holomorphic on open disc and continuous on the closed disc with the boundary condition f(z)=1/z on |z|=1. This is close in spirit (continuity on the closed disc is a standard way to phrase “extends continuously to the boundary”). However, the crucial predicates for holomorphic and continuous are placeholders set to True, making the hypotheses vacuous.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Fatal issue: Both auxiliary definitions `HolomorphicOn` and `ContinuousOn'` are vacuous (:= True). This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders. As a result, the theorem statement no longer faithfully expresses the analytic properties; it instead claims the nonexistence of any function agreeing with 1/z on the unit circle, which is not the original statement and is false.
- Minor discrepancy: The statement in code requires continuity on the closed unit disc, while the natural language mentions extension to the boundary. Typically, these are equivalent in this context if f is defined on the disc and extends continuously to its closure, but since f is a global ℂ → ℂ function in the code, requiring continuity on the closed disc is a natural formalization and is acceptable as a slight strengthening. This would be fine if the predicates were genuine.
- Conclusion: Because of the vacuous auxiliary definitions, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale: The overall structure of the quantified statement and sets (open disk, closed disk, unit circle, boundary values) aligns reasonably with the intended theorem, so if the placeholder predicates were replaced by Mathlib’s `HolomorphicOn`/`ContinuousOn`, it would likely be faithful. However, as written, the placeholders make the statement false/vacuous. This matches the rubric for a case where vacuous definitions are used but the final theorem would be faithful if fixed.

  This declares a theorem: For any type G equipped with a group structure `[Group G]` and a finite type structure `[Fintype G]`, assuming the finite cardinality of G is 5 (`Fintype.card G = 5`), then for all elements `x y : G`, the group operation is commutative: `x * y = y * x`. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but we're auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: ""Show that a group of order 5 must be abelian."" In Lean, expressing abelianness as `∀ x y, x * y = y * x` is a standard and faithful formalization of ""abelian"" for a multiplicative group. The hypothesis `Fintype.card G = 5` correctly captures ""order 5."" Thus the theorem statement matches the intended mathematical content.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem asserts commutativity directly rather than providing a `CommGroup G` instance; this is entirely equivalent for the purpose of stating that the group is abelian.
- No scope mismatch or generalization/specialization issues: the statement is exactly that every group with exactly 5 elements is commutative.
Hence, the translation is faithful.

Suppose f is continuous in a region Ω. Prove that any two primitives of f (if they exist)

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The setting is in the complex plane: functions ℂ → ℂ and a subset Ω ⊆ ℂ.
- Hypothesis hconn : IsConnected Ω means Ω is connected (and nonempty, by Mathlib's definition).
- We have functions f, F, G : ℂ → ℂ.
- hF : ∀ z ∈ Ω, HasDerivAt F (f z) z says: for every z in Ω, F is complex differentiable at z with derivative equal to f z. Similarly for hG.
- Conclusion: ∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ Ω, F z - G z = c, i.e., F − G is constant on Ω.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: “Suppose f is continuous in a region Ω. Prove that any two primitives of f (if they exist) differ by a constant.”
- Usual interpretation: A region Ω is an open, connected subset of ℂ. A primitive of f on Ω is a function F defined on Ω with F' = f on Ω.
- The Lean statement matches the uniqueness claim: If F and G have derivative f at each point of Ω, then F − G is constant on Ω, provided Ω is connected.
- The code does not state f is continuous; however, continuity of f is not needed for uniqueness of primitives—only for existence. The hypothesis that both F and G have derivative f at every point of Ω suffices for the uniqueness claim.
- The code assumes only IsConnected Ω, not that Ω is open. This is a slight generalization: openness is not needed for the uniqueness conclusion when derivatives at points are taken in the ambient ℂ. The code models F and G as ℂ → ℂ (global functions) and uses HasDerivAt at each z ∈ Ω. This is stronger than the typical “within Ω” differentiability but implies the usual condition when Ω is open. The conclusion is the same: F − G is constant on Ω.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Differences:
  - Missing the explicit openness of Ω (region). The code requires only connectedness; this is a benign generalization for the uniqueness result.
  - No continuity assumption on f. This is also benign for uniqueness since the existence of primitives is assumed by hF and hG.
  - Functions F, G are global ℂ → ℂ rather than defined only on Ω; again a benign strengthening of hypotheses.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is precise and standard Mathlib notions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (slightly generalized) of the natural language uniqueness-of-primitive statement.

2) Faithfulness:
The formal statement exactly matches the natural language: it asserts convergence of the sequence (indexed by ℕ) `sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)` to 0 as n → ∞. The use of `Filter.atTop` on ℕ corresponds to “as n → ∞,” and `nhds (0 : ℝ)` corresponds to approaching 0 in ℝ.

  Natural language: Given E ⊆ ℝ with h: E is not countable (i.e., uncountable), there exists p ∈ ℝ such that for all radii r > 0, the intersection E ∩ open_ball(p, r) is uncountable. This is precisely the metric-space formulation that every (open) neighborhood of p contains uncountably many points of E, since open balls form a neighborhood basis in ℝ.
  No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no placeholders or vacuous definitions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement claims existence of a point p in ℝ at which E condenses, defined as every neighborhood of p contains uncountably many points of E. The Lean statement formulates this as: ∀ r > 0, E ∩ ball(p, r) is uncountable. In a metric space, ""every neighborhood"" is equivalent to ""every open ball of positive radius"", so this is faithful.
- Using `¬ Set.Countable` exactly matches ""uncountable"". Using `Metric.ball` (open balls) is appropriate and equivalent to neighborhoods here. The statement does not require p ∈ E, and neither does the code; the natural language also does not require that.

3) Final check: The two statements are the same. No discrepancies: the quantifiers, domain (ℝ), and the meaning of condensation point via uncountability in every neighborhood are correctly captured. There are no extraneous or missing conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If a > 1 is an integer, show that n | φ(a^n − 1), where φ is Euler’s φ-function.
- Lean: a and n are natural numbers; assumptions a > 1 and n > 0; conclusion n ∣ φ(a^n − 1).
- Using ℕ instead of ℤ is fine since a > 1 forces a to be a positive integer in both contexts. The statement typically also assumes n is a positive integer, which the Lean code includes explicitly. The comment above the theorem also states this. Thus the Lean statement matches the standard interpretation and is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The natural language says ""integer"" for a, while Lean uses ℕ (natural numbers). Since a > 1, this is equivalent in effect (a is a positive integer). For n, the Lean code assumes n > 0; the natural language omits this but this is the standard hypothesis and does not change the essence. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are present.

- Docstring explains the intended statement: if `p` tends to `L` and `f` is injective ℕ → ℕ, then the rearranged sequence `p ∘ f` tends to `L`.
- The theorem `Pugh_exercise_2_12a` is stated for an arbitrary topological space `α`, a sequence `p : ℕ → α`, a point `L : α`, and a function `f : ℕ → ℕ`. Under the hypotheses `hf : Function.Injective f` and `hp : Tendsto p atTop (nhds L)`, the conclusion is `Tendsto (p ∘ f) atTop (nhds L)`.

Interpreting: `Tendsto p atTop (nhds L)` means `p_n → L`. The composition `(p ∘ f)` is the sequence `q_k = p_{f(k)}`. The statement says that if `f` is injective, then `q_k → L` as well.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- Lean: For any topological space `α`, if `p : ℕ → α` tends to `L` and `f` is injective, then `p ∘ f` tends to `L`.
- This matches exactly: the rearranged sequence via an injective `f` preserves the limit. The Lean statement is a slight generalization (arbitrary topological space instead of, say, ℝ), which is acceptable and faithful.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Both assert that for a sequence and an injective `f : ℕ → ℕ`, the sequence `q_k = p_{f(k)}` has the same limit as `p_n`. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly captures the claim. The use of filters (`atTop`, `nhds L`) is the standard formalization of sequence convergence.

- The theorem declaration: `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_3_17 {G : Type _} [Group G] (a x : G) : ...` sets up a group `G` and elements `a, x ∈ G`.
- Left-hand side: `Set.centralizer ({x⁻¹ * a * x} : Set G)` denotes the centralizer of the singleton set containing the element `x⁻¹ * a * x`. This is exactly the set of elements of `G` that commute with `x⁻¹ a x`, i.e., `C(x⁻¹ a x)`.
- Right-hand side: `(fun g => x⁻¹ * g * x) '' (Set.centralizer ({a} : Set G))` is the image of the centralizer of `{a}` (i.e., the set of elements commuting with `a`, namely `C(a)`) under the map `g ↦ x⁻¹ g x`. This image is precisely the conjugate set `x⁻¹ C(a) x`.
- Thus, the statement claims: `C(x⁻¹ a x) = x⁻¹ C(a) x`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: If G is a group and a, x ∈ G, prove that C(x^{-1} a x) = x^{-1} C(a) x.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The code fixes a natural number m and works with the type (Fin m → ℝ), which is Lean’s standard realization of ℝ^m.
- It assumes typeclass instances: [NormedAddCommGroup (Fin m → ℝ)] and [NormedSpace ℝ (Fin m → ℝ)], i.e., (Fin m → ℝ) is equipped with some norm making it a normed vector space over ℝ. This matches “let ‖·‖ be any norm on ℝ^m”.
- It also assumes [FiniteDimensional ℝ (Fin m → ℝ)], which is a standard property of ℝ^m (and holds regardless of the chosen norm). Including it as an assumption is acceptable and aligns with the finite-dimensional setting of the natural statement.
- The lemma asserts: IsCompact ({ x : Fin m → ℝ | ‖x‖ ≤ 1 }), i.e., the closed unit ball with respect to the chosen norm is compact.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: For any norm on ℝ^m, the set B = {x ∈ ℝ^m : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} is compact.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: it considers ℝ^m as (Fin m → ℝ), allows an arbitrary norm via the NormedAddCommGroup/NormedSpace instances, and states that the closed unit ball is compact.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. There’s a single lemma statement.
- The only extra hypothesis is [FiniteDimensional ℝ (Fin m → ℝ)], which is inherently true for ℝ^m and consistent with the natural language statement. This is not a restriction beyond the intended setting.
- Therefore, the formal statement faithfully captures the natural language claim.

2) Overall faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If G1 and G2 are cyclic groups of orders m and n, then G1 × G2 is cyclic iff m and n are relatively prime.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes this: assumes cyclicity and finite cardinalities equal to m and n, and concludes an equivalence between IsCyclic (G1 × G2) and Nat.gcd m n = 1.

- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; all predicates (IsCyclic, Fintype.card) are standard Mathlib.
- The use of gcd = 1 versus coprime is a standard equivalence, not a discrepancy.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The setting: Ω : Set ℂ with hΩ : IsOpen Ω. So Ω is an open subset of ℂ.
- φ : ℂ → ℂ is a complex-valued function on ℂ.
- hmap : ∀ z, z ∈ Ω → φ z ∈ Ω. So φ maps Ω into itself (φ(Ω) ⊆ Ω).
- hφ : DifferentiableOn ℂ φ Ω. φ is holomorphic on Ω.
- z0 : ℂ with hz0 : z0 ∈ Ω. A point z0 in Ω.
- hfix : φ z0 = z0. z0 is a fixed point of φ.
- hder : deriv φ z0 = 1. The complex derivative of φ at z0 equals 1.
- Conclusion: ∃ (a b : ℂ), ∀ z, z ∈ Ω → φ z = a * z + b. There exist complex constants a, b such that on Ω, φ is affine linear: φ(z) = a z + b for all z ∈ Ω.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Original: Ω is a bounded open subset of ℂ; φ: Ω → Ω is holomorphic. If there exists z0 ∈ Ω with φ(z0) = z0 and φ'(z0) = 1, then φ is linear.
- Lean version: Ω is open (boundedness not assumed); φ is a global function ℂ → ℂ that maps Ω into itself and is holomorphic on Ω; with a fixed point z0 and derivative 1 at z0, then φ is affine linear on Ω.
- The use of φ : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on Ω and φ(Ω) ⊆ Ω is a standard and faithful formalization of φ : Ω → Ω holomorphic.
- The conclusion in Lean is explicitly “affine linear” (φ(z) = az + b). In complex analysis, “linear” in this context typically means affine linear; moreover, with φ'(z0) = 1 and φ(z0) = z0, the affine linear form forces a = 1 and b = 0, i.e., φ is the identity on Ω, which is stronger than merely being affine. So the conclusion matches or is even sharper than the informal phrasing.

Step 3: Differences and assessment.
- Boundedness: The original assumes Ω is bounded; the Lean statement omits boundedness. This is a generalization. As a translation, this is a slight difference in hypotheses. The rest of the structure is the same.
- Domain/codomain formalization: φ : ℂ → ℂ with restrictions is a faithful way to encode φ : Ω → Ω. No issue.
- Terminology “linear” vs “affine linear”: In context, this is acceptable and arguably more precise. Given the derivative and fixed point conditions, the affine form collapses to the identity anyway.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib, and the theorem is a proper statement (proof omitted via sorry is allowed for our auditing task).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization with a mild generalization (dropping boundedness). This fits the guideline that slight generalizations are acceptable.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: States the theorem: If G is a nonabelian group of order 6, then G is isomorphic to S_3, with no proof provided.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_37 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: Let G be a type with a group structure and finitely many elements.
- Hypotheses:
  - `h_card : Fintype.card G = 6`: The order (cardinality) of G is 6.
  - `h_nonabel : ¬(∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a)`: G is nonabelian (not commutative; i.e., it is not true that a*b = b*a for all a,b).
- Conclusion: `Nonempty (MulEquiv G (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))`: There exists a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between G and `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`, the group of permutations of a 3-element set (i.e., S_3).
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; this is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: If G is a nonabelian group of order 6, then G ≅ S_3. The Lean statement assumes G is a group, finite of order 6, and nonabelian, and concludes the existence of a group isomorphism to the permutation group on Fin 3, which is precisely S_3. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- S_3 is represented as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)`, which is standard.
- ""G ≅ S_3"" is represented as `Nonempty (MulEquiv G (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))`, meaning there exists a group isomorphism.
- Nonabelian is correctly encoded as `¬ ∀ a b, a * b = b * a`.
- No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The proof is omitted but allowed.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem herstein_exercise_4_2_5 {R : Type _} [Ring R] (h : ∀ x : R, x ^ 3 = x) : ∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a := by sorry`
  • This declares a theorem for an arbitrary type R equipped with a `Ring` structure.
  • Assumption `h : ∀ x : R, x ^ 3 = x` states that every element of R satisfies x cubed equals x.
  • Conclusion `∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a` asserts that multiplication in R is commutative.
  • The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for assessing translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: Let R be a ring in which x^3 = x for every x in R. Prove that R is commutative.
- The Lean theorem exactly captures this: under the hypothesis that every x satisfies x^3 = x, conclude that all pairs commute under multiplication.
- The use of `Ring R` in Mathlib indicates a (not-necessarily commutative) ring with 1. The conclusion is precisely multiplicative commutativity.

3) Final check for differences:
- Minor technical nuance: Lean’s `x ^ 3` uses the monoid power (requiring a 1), so `Ring R` includes a 1. Some texts define rings without 1, but the statement uses x^3 notation anyway; this is at most a mild specialization and is standard in Mathlib. This does not materially change the meaning of the problem.
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which contains the definitions for matrices, ideals, and related algebraic structures.
- Comment: States the mathematical intent — showing the ring of 2×2 real matrices has no nontrivial two-sided ideals, framed as an exercise.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_4_3_25 (I : Ideal (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)) : I = ⊥ ∨ I = ⊤ := by sorry`
  - This declares a theorem for any `I` which is an `Ideal` of the ring `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ` (i.e., 2×2 real matrices).
  - In Mathlib, `Ideal R` for a (possibly noncommutative) ring `R` is a two-sided ideal.
  - The conclusion `I = ⊥ ∨ I = ⊤` reads: either `I` is the zero ideal (⊥) or `I` is the whole ring (⊤).
  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but for translation auditing we only check the statement.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let R be the ring of 2×2 matrices over ℝ; if I is an ideal of R, then I = (0) or I = R.
- Lean: Exactly the same ring `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ`, and `Ideal` means two-sided ideal. Conclusion matches: `I = ⊥ ∨ I = ⊤` is precisely `I = (0)` or `I = R`.

Checks for discrepancies or red flags:
- No auxiliary or placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ` and `Ideal`.
- The statement is neither stronger nor weaker than the original; it is an exact match.

- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib for topology notions like connectedness and interior.
- Docstring: States the exercise and gives the illustrative example (two closed unit disks in R^2 touching at one boundary point), aligning with the intended counterexample.
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_57 : ∃ s : Set (ℝ × ℝ), IsConnected s ∧ ¬ IsConnected (interior s) := by sorry`: Formal statement that there exists a subset s of R^2 that is connected but whose interior (in R^2) is not connected. No auxiliary definitions; uses standard Mathlib notions `IsConnected` and `interior`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement claims: it is not true in general that the interior of a connected set is connected. Providing a single counterexample in a familiar space (R^2) suffices to establish this. The Lean theorem asserts the existence of such a set in R^2, exactly as in the example mentioned in the docstring. Thus, it captures the intended content.

3) Final check for differences:
- The original phrasing is general; the Lean statement specializes to subsets of R^2. This is a standard and acceptable specialization to demonstrate ""not true in general.""
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the terms are from Mathlib.
- The statement requires existence only, with no proof content, which is acceptable per instructions.
Overall, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the claim via a concrete ambient space.

  The `by sorry` is a placeholder for the proof, but it does not alter the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that any two nonabelian groups of order 21 are isomorphic.""
- The Lean statement quantifies over arbitrary groups `G` and `H`, assumes they are finite with 21 elements (order 21), and assumes they are nonabelian (via existence of non-commuting elements), and concludes `G ≃* H` (an isomorphism). This is exactly the formal counterpart of the English statement.
- Using `∃ a b, a * b ≠ b * a` is a standard and correct formulation of ""nonabelian"" (i.e., not abelian).
- Requiring `Fintype` and `Fintype.card = 21` correctly captures ""order 21"".
- Providing a specific isomorphism `G ≃* H` rather than stating `Nonempty (G ≃* H)` is a conventional, and faithful, strengthening in Lean of an existence claim; it matches the mathematical content.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No extraneous or missing hypotheses relative to the natural language statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions are introduced; the only declaration is the main statement itself.
- The conclusion is exactly that `G` and `H` are isomorphic as groups.

Therefore, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: ""If G is an abelian group and if G has an element of order m and one of order n, where m and n are relatively prime, prove that G has an element of order mn."" The Lean statement matches this closely: G is an abelian group (`[CommGroup G]`), there exist elements a, b with orders m, n, respectively, and gcd(m, n) = 1, then there exists x with order m*n.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The only subtle difference is that in Mathlib, `orderOf : G → ℕ` can be 0 to encode infinite order, and the code does not explicitly exclude `m = 0` or `n = 0`. With `gcd m n = 1`, the only additional cases included are (m, n) = (0, 1) or (1, 0). In those cases, the conclusion asserts existence of an element of order 0 (infinite order), which is a slight generalization beyond the usual textbook convention that an element’s order is a positive integer.
- Apart from this slight generalization, the statement is a faithful formalization. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib notions (`CommGroup`, `orderOf`, `Nat.gcd`).

Given the instructions, this is a near-exact translation with a minimal generalization due to Mathlib’s convention for `orderOf`. This warrants a high score.

  Natural language: For any finite group G (given by `[Group G] [Fintype G]`) whose order is even (`h : 2 ∣ Fintype.card G`), there exists an element `g` in G that is not the identity and satisfies `g * g = 1`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that a group of even order contains an element of order 2."" This means: for a finite group with even cardinality, there exists an element whose order is exactly 2.
- In any group, having `g ≠ 1` and `g * g = 1` is equivalent to saying `g` has order 2 (since `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1` implies the order divides 2 and is not 1, hence exactly 2). Thus the goal `∃ g, g ≠ 1 ∧ g * g = 1` faithfully expresses the existence of an element of order 2.

- The natural language statement asks to show there are infinitely many integers a such that f(x) = x^7 + 15x^2 - 30x + a is irreducible in ℚ[x].
- The Lean statement precisely asserts that the set of integers a with the property that the polynomial over ℚ, x^7 + 15x^2 - 30x + a, is irreducible, is infinite. The coefficients 15 and −30 are embedded as rationals; the constant term a is an integer coerced to ℚ, so the polynomial is in ℚ[x]. This matches exactly.

- `{p m : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hm : ¬ p ∣ m) (hcardG : Fintype.card G = p * m)` states p and m are natural numbers, p is prime, p does not divide m, and |G| = p m. This matches the hypothesis |G| = pm with p ∤ m and p prime.
- `(H : Subgroup G) [Fintype H] (hcardH : Fintype.card H = p)` introduces a subgroup H of G with |H| = p. The `[Fintype H]` is a harmless typeclass assumption (and follows from finite G), consistent with H being finite of order p.
- `(Hnormal : ∀ (g : G) {h : G}, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H)` encodes that H is normal: closed under conjugation by any g ∈ G. This is the standard characterization of normality for a subgroup.
- Conclusion: `∀ e : G ≃* G, Subgroup.map (e.toMonoidHom) H = H` says that for every group automorphism e of G (a multiplicative equivalence from G to itself), the image of H under e equals H. This is exactly the statement that H is characteristic.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let |G| = pm with p prime and p ∤ m. If H is a normal subgroup of order p in G, prove H is characteristic. The Lean statement assumes the same numerical conditions on |G|, assumes H is a subgroup of order p and normal, and concludes that for every automorphism, the image of H is H.
- The use of `Subgroup.map (e.toMonoidHom) H = H` is a standard formal translation of ""H is characteristic."" The domain/codomain of e is G, so these are automorphisms. No extraneous or missing hypotheses relative to the intended statement.

Checks for red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced.
- The presence of `[Fintype H]` is not problematic; it is consistent and often convenient in Lean.

Final comparison:
- The formal Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same mathematically. There are no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: Let G be a group.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_2_4_19 {a : G} (ha : a ≠ 1) (ha2 : a * a = 1) (huniq : ∀ x : G, x ≠ 1 → x * x = 1 → x = a) : ∀ g : G, a * g = g * a := by sorry`
  This states: Suppose a ∈ G satisfies a ≠ 1 and a*a = 1 (so a has order 2), and moreover for any x ∈ G, if x ≠ 1 and x*x = 1 then x = a (uniqueness of the nontrivial element squaring to 1). Then for every g ∈ G, a*g = g*a (i.e., a commutes with all elements, so a is central).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: If a group contains exactly one element of order 2, then that element is in the center of the group.
- In a group, “order 2” is equivalent to x ≠ 1 and x^2 = 1. The code encodes existence by providing an element a with a ≠ 1 and a*a = 1, and encodes uniqueness with `huniq: ∀ x, x ≠ 1 → x*x = 1 → x = a`. The conclusion `∀ g, a*g = g*a` exactly states that a is in the center.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code’s hypotheses precisely capture “there exists exactly one element of order 2,” and the conclusion matches “that element is central.” No extraneous assumptions are added, and no weaker/stronger statement is proven. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. The formulation is a standard and faithful formalization.

Hence, the translation is faithful.

- Variables: G is a finite group; p is a natural number with hp: p is prime; hcard: |G| = p^2.
- Conclusion: There exists a subgroup H ≤ G such that |H| = p and Subgroup.normalizer H = H.

In words, the theorem asserts the existence of a subgroup of order p that is self-normalizing (its normalizer equals itself).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim: A group of order p^2 has a normal subgroup of order p.
In Mathlib, “H is normal in G” is expressed by H.Normal or equivalently Subgroup.normalizer H = ⊤ (the whole group), not Subgroup.normalizer H = H. The code imposes the very different (and much stronger) property that H is self-normalizing. In a group of order p^2, a subgroup of order p is actually normal, hence its normalizer is all of G, not just H. So the code’s condition contradicts the intended normality condition.

3) Final check:
They are not the same. The code asks for a subgroup H of order p with normalizer equal to H (self-normalizing), whereas the statement asks for a normal subgroup (normalizer equal to G or H.Normal). The correct formal translation would be something like: ∃ H : Subgroup G, Nat.card H = p ∧ H.Normal (or Subgroup.normalizer H = ⊤). No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present, but the main property is mistranslated.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- `∀ x y : Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G), (x : G) * (y : G) = (y : G) * (x : G)` states that for all elements x and y in the subgroup generated by {a, b} (i.e., Subgroup.closure {a, b}), their images in G commute: (x : G) * (y : G) = (y : G) * (x : G).
- Using the coercions `(x : G)` and `(y : G)` is standard: the multiplication in the subgroup is inherited from G, so commutativity expressed in G for the elements of the subgroup is equivalent to commutativity in the subgroup itself.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let H be the subgroup generated by a and b in G. If ab = ba, then H is an abelian group.
- The code asserts precisely that every pair of elements in `Subgroup.closure ({a, b})` (which is H) commute. This is exactly the condition that H is abelian.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; `Subgroup.closure` is the standard Mathlib notion for the subgroup generated by a set.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code’s statement ""∀ x y in H, (x : G) * (y : G) = (y : G) * (x : G)"" is equivalent to saying H is abelian, since the group structure on H is inherited from G. There is no substantive difference.
- Thus, the translation is faithful and precise.

- The theorem `herstein_exercise_5_2_20 {F V : Type*} [Field F] [Infinite F] [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]` sets up: F is a field, infinite; V is an additive commutative group with a scalar action by F (i.e., a vector space over F).
- Statement: `∀ {n : Nat} (Ws : Fin n → Submodule F V), (∀ i, Ws i ≠ ⊤) → ∃ v : V, ∀ i, v ∉ (Ws i : Set V)`.
  • For any natural number n and any family of submodules Ws indexed by Fin n (i.e., a finite family of subspaces),
  • assuming each Ws i is proper (formalized as `Ws i ≠ ⊤`),
  • there exists a vector v in V such that for all i, v is not in the submodule Ws i (coercion `(Ws i : Set V)` is the underlying set).
  This is equivalent to saying the union of these finitely many proper subspaces does not cover V.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The original statement: ""Let V be a vector space over an infinite field F. Show that V cannot be the set-theoretic union of a finite number of proper subspaces of V."" The Lean statement asserts that for any finite family of proper subspaces, there exists a vector not contained in any of them. This is logically equivalent to saying the finite union is not equal to V. The use of `Submodule F V`, `Ws i ≠ ⊤` (properness), and indexing by `Fin n` (finiteness) matches the mathematical content precisely. The typeclass `[Infinite F]` captures the ""infinite field"" hypothesis.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Proper subspace is correctly formalized as `≠ ⊤`.
- Finite union is captured by indexing over `Fin n`.
- The conclusion is an equivalent reformulation (existence of v outside the union). No weakening/strengthening is introduced.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present; only the theorem statement is given.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_4_2_9 {p : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hp_odd : p ≠ 2)` states p is a natural number, prime, and not equal to 2 (so p is an odd prime).
- `(a b : Int) (hb : b ≠ 0)` introduces integers a, b with b ≠ 0 (so a/b is a defined rational).
- `(h : (a : ℚ) / (b : ℚ) = (Finset.range (p - 1)).sum (fun i : ℕ => (1 : ℚ) / (i + 1 : ℚ)))` asserts the rational equality a/b = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p − 1). Indeed, `Finset.range (p - 1)` is {0,1,...,p−2} and the term is 1/(i+1), so the sum is 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p−1).
- `(hcop : Int.gcd a b = 1)` says a and b are coprime (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms).
- `: (p : Int) ∣ a` is the conclusion that p, viewed as an integer, divides a.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: For an odd prime p, write 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p − 1) = a/b with integers a, b, and show p | a.
- The Lean theorem matches the context (odd prime p, the harmonic sum as a rational) and the desired conclusion (p divides the numerator). It explicitly works over ℚ and uses a finite sum corresponding to 1 through p−1.
- The code adds an extra hypothesis `Int.gcd a b = 1` (lowest terms). The natural statement did not explicitly say the fraction is reduced. Often such problems intend a/b to be in lowest terms, but even if not, the key classical result is that the numerator in lowest terms is divisible by p, which implies p divides any numerator of any representation too. The added hypothesis is thus a harmless specialization rather than a distortion of meaning.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Differences:
  - Extra assumption `gcd(a,b)=1` not stated explicitly in the natural language. This is a slight specialization. The b ≠ 0 condition is implicit in forming a/b and is fine.
- Otherwise, the sum, domain, and conclusion match exactly.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to a minor, standard additional hypothesis. No vacuous or placeholder definitions. Statement is on point.

  `theorem Artin_exercise_10_4_6 (I J : Ideal R) {x : R} (hx : x ∈ I ∧ x ∈ J) : IsNilpotent (Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J) x) := by sorry`
  reads: For any commutative ring R, any ideals I and J of R, and any element x of R such that x ∈ I and x ∈ J (equivalently, x ∈ I ∩ J), the image of x in the quotient ring R/(I*J) is nilpotent. Here `Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J) x` denotes the residue class of x in the quotient ring R ⧸ (I*J). `IsNilpotent` asserts nilpotency of that class.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: “Let I, J be ideals in a ring R. Prove that the residue of any element of I ∩ J in R / I J is nilpotent.”
- Lean: For any I, J ideals and any x with x ∈ I ∧ x ∈ J, the residue class of x in R/(I*J) is nilpotent.
- This matches exactly: membership in I ∩ J is expressed as `x ∈ I ∧ x ∈ J`, the quotient is by the product ideal `I * J`, and nilpotency is expressed by `IsNilpotent` of the residue. The theorem is universally quantified over I, J, and x, so it captures “any element.”

Checks for potential issues:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the only statement is the theorem with an unfilled proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- The requirement `[CommRing R]` is a standard formalization choice for quotient rings in Mathlib and is a slight specialization of “ring” that is acceptable per the guidelines.
- The use of `Ideal.Quotient.mk (I * J) x` is the standard way to denote the residue class of x in R/(I*J).

- The theorem states: `(Ideal.span ({C (2 : Int)} : Set (Polynomial Int))) ⊓ (Ideal.span ({X} : Set (Polynomial Int))) = Ideal.span ({C (2 : Int) * X} : Set (Polynomial Int))`.
  - `Polynomial Int` is the ring ℤ[x].
  - `Ideal.span ({C (2 : Int)} : Set (Polynomial Int))` is the ideal in ℤ[x] generated by the constant polynomial 2, i.e., the ideal (2) in ℤ[x].
  - `Ideal.span ({X} : Set (Polynomial Int))` is the ideal generated by `X`, i.e., the ideal (x) in ℤ[x].
  - `⊓` is the infimum of ideals, which for ideals in a ring is their intersection.
  - `Ideal.span ({C (2 : Int) * X} : Set (Polynomial Int))` is the ideal generated by the single polynomial `2 * X`, i.e., the ideal (2x) in ℤ[x].
  - Therefore, the statement is: (2) ∩ (x) = (2x) in ℤ[x].

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is exactly “In the ring ℤ[x], (2) ∩ (x) = (2x).”
- The Lean code precisely formalizes this equality of ideals in ℤ[x], using the standard mathlib notions: `C 2` for the constant polynomial 2, `X` for the variable x, `Ideal.span` for principal ideals, and `⊓` for intersection.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; it is a direct formalization of the statement.

Final check: The two math statements are the same.

- `def is_normal (H : Subgroup G) : Prop := ∀ a x, x ∈ (H : Set G) → a * x * a⁻¹ ∈ (H : Set G)`: Define normality of H as being closed under conjugation by every group element. This is a standard and correct characterization of normality for subgroups.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The intended statement: “If P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G and P is normal in G, then P is the only p-Sylow subgroup of G.” A faithful formalization would state: for any Q that is a p-Sylow subgroup, Q = P. The theorem indeed takes an arbitrary Q with `is_p_sylow p Q` and concludes `P = Q`, which expresses uniqueness.

3) Discrepancies:
- Major issue: `is_p_sylow` is not defined; it is an arbitrary predicate variable, not tied to Mathlib’s actual definition of a p-Sylow subgroup (e.g., `Sylow p G` or a predicate like `IsSylow p P`). This makes the statement vacuous with respect to the intended mathematical content; it could be any property at all. This violates the guideline to use actual Mathlib concepts or faithful definitions.
- The code does not assume or encode that `p` is prime, which is implicit in the term “p-Sylow subgroup.” In Mathlib, Sylow theory typically requires `Fact p.Prime`.
- The custom `is_normal` definition is fine mathematically (equivalent to normality), though not using Mathlib’s `Subgroup.Normal`; that alone would be acceptable, but the main deficiency remains the placeholder `is_p_sylow`.

Conclusion: While the quantifier structure of the theorem matches the uniqueness claim, the crucial concept of “p-Sylow subgroup” is left as an uninterpreted predicate, so the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial` are just setup; they import Mathlib and open the Polynomial namespace.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_1b : Irreducible (X ^ 3 + 6 * X + 12 : ℚ[X]) := by ...` states exactly that the polynomial X^3 + 6·X + 12, viewed as an element of the polynomial ring over the rationals ℚ[X], is irreducible. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks to prove that x^3 + 6x + 12 is irreducible in ℚ (i.e., over the rationals). The Lean statement formalizes this as `Irreducible (X ^ 3 + 6 * X + 12 : ℚ[X])`, which is the standard formalization of “irreducible over ℚ”. The polynomial matches exactly (no x^2 term), and the coefficient ring is ℚ.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The comment about Eisenstein at p = 3 is consistent with the intended proof but does not affect the statement. The presence of `sorry` is about proof, not the statement; the task concerns translation of the statement, which is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Artin_exercise_10_7_10 {R : Type _} [Ring R] {M : Ideal R}`: Let R be a ring (not necessarily commutative; with 1) and M an ideal of R.
- `(h : ∀ x : R, x ∉ M → IsUnit x)`: Hypothesis: every element of R that is not in M is a unit of R.
- `: M.IsMaximal ∧ (∀ I : Ideal R, I.IsMaximal → I = M)`: Conclusion: M is a maximal ideal and, moreover, for any ideal I of R, if I is maximal then I equals M. That is, M is the unique maximal ideal.
- `:= by sorry`: No proof provided; just the statement.

2) Overall faithfulness:
The Lean statement exactly mirrors the natural language statement: given a ring R and an ideal M such that all elements outside M are units, conclude M is maximal and is the only maximal ideal. The second conjunct expresses uniqueness of the maximal ideal precisely.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The Lean code assumes `[Ring R]` (not necessarily commutative). The natural statement did not specify commutativity, so this is at worst a slight generalization, which is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is stated directly in Mathlib terms (`Ideal`, `IsUnit`, `IsMaximal`).
- Potential edge cases (like the zero ring) are not handled in either the Lean or the natural language text; this does not affect faithfulness of the translation.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_13_4_10 (p r : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hr : p = 2 ^ r + 1) : ∃ k : ℕ, r = 2 ^ k := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: for natural numbers p and r, if p is prime and p = 2^r + 1, then there exists k : ℕ such that r = 2^k. No proof is provided (sorry), but the statement is clear and uses standard Mathlib notions (Nat.Prime, exponentiation on ℕ).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: If a prime integer p has the form 2^r + 1, then p actually has the form 2^{2^k} + 1. The Lean statement concludes ∃ k, r = 2^k under the same hypotheses. Given the hypothesis hr: p = 2^r + 1, the conclusion r = 2^k is equivalent to saying p = 2^{2^k} + 1 by substitution. Thus the formal statement is logically equivalent to the natural language claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: natural numbers vs integers: using ℕ for a prime p is standard and matches the usual meaning of a positive prime integer; no substantive difference.
- Conclusion phrasing: Lean concludes about r being a power of 2, whereas the natural language concludes about p being of the form 2^{2^k} + 1. With the given hypothesis hr, these are equivalent. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_22a {G : Type*} [Group G] (x g : G) : orderOf x = orderOf (g⁻¹ * x * g) := by sorry`
  This states: For any type G equipped with a group structure, and for any elements x and g of G, the order of x equals the order of the element g⁻¹ * x * g (i.e., the conjugate of x by g, using the convention g⁻¹ x g). No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; `orderOf` is Mathlib's standard notion of the order of a group element.

2) Overall faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: If x and g are elements of the group G, prove that |x| = |g^{-1} x g|, where |x| denotes the order of x. The Lean statement exactly asserts `orderOf x = orderOf (g⁻¹ * x * g)` under the assumption `[Group G]`. This is a direct formalization of the invariance of order under conjugation, with the same conjugation convention as in the natural language statement (g^{-1} x g).

3) Final check for differences:
- Notation: `|x|` in the statement corresponds to `orderOf x` in Lean; this is standard.
- Conjugation: Both use g⁻¹ x g; consistent.
- Assumptions: Both assume a group G and elements x, g; consistent.
- No extra or missing conditions. No vacuous placeholders. The theorem is stated exactly as the natural language claim.
Thus the translation is faithful.

  1) x*y = y*x if and only if y^{-1}*x*y = x.
  2) y^{-1}*x*y = x if and only if x^{-1}*y^{-1}*x*y = 1.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original says: For x, y in G, prove that xy = yx iff y^{-1}xy = x iff x^{-1}y^{-1}xy = 1.
- In formal logic, the chain ""A iff B iff C"" is commonly captured by (A ↔ B) ∧ (B ↔ C). The Lean statement is exactly that, with A = (x*y = y*x), B = (y^{-1}*x*y = x), and C = (x^{-1}*y^{-1}*x*y = 1).

  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we are only auditing the statement/translation.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that if x^2=1 for all x in G then G is abelian.""
- The Lean theorem precisely states: if every element squares to the identity in a (multiplicative) group, then all elements commute. This is exactly the same as the natural language statement. Using `x * x = 1` instead of `x^2 = 1` is a standard equivalent phrasing in groups.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The code directly states the theorem with a clear hypothesis and conclusion. Using `∀ a b, a * b = b * a` to represent ""G is abelian"" is faithful.

Final check:
- Same problem: yes. No generalization or specialization beyond the original claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_11_22 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] {p n : ℕ} (H : Subgroup G)`: Let G be a finite group (type with a Group structure and Fintype), p and n are natural numbers, and H is a subgroup of G.
- `(hp : Nat.Prime p)`: Assume p is prime.
- `(hG : Nat.card G = p ^ n)`: The order of G is p^n.
- `(hH : Nat.card (↥H) = p ^ (n - 1))`: The order of the subgroup H is p^(n-1). Here `(↥H)` denotes the underlying set of H.
- `: H.Normal := by sorry`: Conclude that H is normal in G. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation fidelity.

2) Whole statement faithfulness:
The code asserts that for a finite group G of order p^n and a subgroup H of order p^(n−1), with p prime, H is normal in G. This matches the standard group theory result: in a finite p-group, any subgroup of index p (equivalently of order p^(n−1)) is normal.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean statement explicitly assumes `Nat.Prime p`. The natural language statement implicitly assumes p is prime (this is standard when discussing groups of order p^n), so this is a faithful and appropriate explicitness.
- The Lean statement takes a particular subgroup `H` and concludes it is normal under the cardinality hypothesis, which corresponds to the universal claim ""any subgroup ... is normal"".
- Allowing `n = 0` via `n - 1` being truncated to 0 in `ℕ` slightly generalizes the domain, but it remains consistent: the only subgroup has order 1 and is normal. This does not harm faithfulness.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement with proper Mathlib notions (`Subgroup`, `Normal`, `Nat.card`).

Conclusion: The translation is faithful to the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: Fix an arbitrary type G with a group structure.
- The theorem statement `theorem inv_is_hom_iff_comm : (∀ x y : G, (x * y)⁻¹ = x⁻¹ * y⁻¹) ↔ (∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x)` says: For all elements x,y in G, the condition that the inverse map satisfies (x*y)^{-1} = x^{-1} * y^{-1} (i.e., the inverse map is a homomorphism) is equivalent to the condition that for all x,y, x*y = y*x (i.e., G is abelian). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation.

2) Whole translation assessment:
- The left side exactly encodes “the map g ↦ g^{-1} is a homomorphism” via the homomorphism condition f(xy) = f(x)f(y) with f(g) = g^{-1}.
- The right side encodes “G is abelian” as ∀ x y, x*y = y*x.
- Hence the Lean statement faithfully matches the natural language claim.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem statement is exactly the intended equivalence. Using a pointwise condition for homomorphism rather than `MonoidHom` is a standard and faithful formalization.
- No scope or generality issues. The code aligns perfectly with the statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open set-theoretic notation.

- The theorem statement:
  `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_2_4_4 (H : Subgroup G) : H = Subgroup.closure ((H : Set G) \ { (1 : G) }) := by sorry`
  In words: For any subgroup H of G, H equals the subgroup generated by the set of elements of H with the identity 1 removed. Here `(H : Set G)` is the underlying set of H, `\ {1}` removes the identity from that set, and `Subgroup.closure` denotes the subgroup generated by a set.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement says: If H is a subgroup of G then H is generated by the set H − {1}. In Lean, “generated by a set S” is expressed as `Subgroup.closure S`. The code states exactly that `H = Subgroup.closure ((H : Set G) \ {1})`. This is a faithful formalization. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check and differences:
The mathematical content matches precisely. Edge cases (e.g., H = {1}) are correctly handled since `Subgroup.closure ∅ = ⊥ = {1}`. There are no discrepancies between the natural language statement and the Lean theorem statement.

- The theorem declaration: `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_8 {p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (n : ℕ) : Irreducible (X ^ n - C (p : ℚ)) := by ...`
  This states: For any natural number p that is prime and any natural number n, the polynomial X^n − C(p : ℚ) (i.e., x^n − p viewed in ℚ[x]) is irreducible in ℚ[x]. The comment notes proof by Eisenstein at p.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Let p be a prime integer. Prove that the polynomial x^n − p is irreducible in ℚ[x].” Standardly, this is intended for n ≥ 1. The Lean statement asserts irreducibility for all n : ℕ, including n = 0. When n = 0, the polynomial is X^0 − p = 1 − p, a nonzero constant in ℚ[x], hence a unit, thus not irreducible. Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly stronger and actually false in the n = 0 case.

Aside from that, the representation of a prime integer as `p : ℕ` with `p.Prime` is appropriate, and the polynomial is correctly represented as `X ^ n - C (p : ℚ)` in ℚ[x]. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the only issue is the missing hypothesis n ≥ 1.

3) Final check:
The two statements are not the same because the Lean version includes the invalid case n = 0. With the added condition `n ≥ 1` (or `0 < n`), the theorem would faithfully match the natural language statement. As written, it is almost faithful but not correct due to this edge case.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We work with a group G.
- `def center (G : Type*) [Group G] : Set G := { z | ∀ g : G, z * g = g * z }`: The center of G is defined as the set of elements commuting with every element of G. This matches the usual definition of the center Z(G), albeit as a Set rather than a Subgroup.
- Theorem statement:
  Hypothesis `h : ∃ a : G, ∀ g : G, ∃ n : Int, ∃ z : G, (∀ t : G, z * t = t * z) ∧ g = a ^ n * z` reads: There exists an element a in G such that for every g in G, there exist an integer n and an element z that commutes with all elements of G (i.e., z ∈ Z(G)) with g = a^n z. This is precisely the statement that every coset gZ equals (aZ)^n, i.e., G/Z is generated by the coset aZ, so G/Z is cyclic.
  Conclusion `(∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x) ∧ center G = Set.univ`: G is abelian, and the center (as a set) equals the whole set G; i.e., Z(G) = G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If G/Z is cyclic, then G is abelian and hence G = Z. The hypothesis `h` gives exactly the standard characterization of G/Z being cyclic, by existence of a ∈ G such that every g lies in a^n Z, i.e., g = a^n z with z central. Using Int exponents is appropriate for a cyclic group (covers both finite and infinite cases). The conclusion asserts that G is abelian and that the center equals the whole group, which matches “and hence G = Z”.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definition of center is correct. The hypothesis is an exact formalization of “G/Z is cyclic.” The conclusion exactly matches “G is abelian and hence G = Z,” expressed as a conjunction. Minor technical choices (Set vs Subgroup center, Int powers) are legitimate and do not change meaning.
- Therefore the Lean statement is a faithful translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement precisely matches the natural-language statement: it uses group-theoretic power `x ^ 2`, the identity `1 : G`, and `orderOf x` to capture |x|. The disjunction `orderOf x = 1 ∨ orderOf x = 2` matches “either 1 or 2.”

3) Final comparison: The two math problems are not comparable because the Lean side is missing. A faithful formalization would need to assert: for primes p, q and a finite group G with card G = p^2 * q (or q * p^2), there does not exist a simple group structure on G (i.e., G is not simple). In Lean/Mathlib, one would expect hypotheses involving [Group G], [Fintype G], Nat.Prime p, Nat.Prime q, and a statement like ¬ IsSimpleGroup G or IsSimpleGroup G → False under the card hypothesis. None of this is present.

- The natural language statement: If x has infinite order in G, then the elements x^n for n ∈ ℤ are all distinct. Equivalently, the map n ↦ x^n is injective: x^m = x^n implies m = n.
- The Lean theorem exactly states injectivity of n ↦ x^n under the hypothesis `orderOf x = 0` (infinite order) and uses a group so that negative powers are defined. This is precisely the same mathematical content.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; no placeholders other than the proof `sorry`. The use of `orderOf x = 0` is the standard Mathlib expression of infinite order. The domain is a group, matching the need for negative powers.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- They are the same. The Lean statement is exactly the injectivity claim over ℤ-powers under infinite order. No generalization or restriction beyond what is intended. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- Comment explains the intended mathematical statement: show the multiplicative groups R \ {0} and C \ {0} are not isomorphic, expressed in Lean via the units groups `Units ℝ` and `Units ℂ`.
- `theorem units_real_not_iso_units_complex : ¬ Nonempty (Units ℝ ≃* Units ℂ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: There does not exist a group isomorphism between the units group of ℝ and the units group of ℂ. Equivalently, `Units ℝ` and `Units ℂ` are not isomorphic as groups.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- For a field `F`, `Units F` is exactly the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of `F`. Thus `Units ℝ` is the multiplicative group ℝ \ {0}, and `Units ℂ` is the multiplicative group ℂ \ {0}.
- The statement `¬ Nonempty (Units ℝ ≃* Units ℂ)` exactly says there is no group isomorphism between these multiplicative groups. This matches the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given (with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language statement is about the multiplicative groups ℝ \ {0} and ℂ \ {0}. The Lean code uses `Units ℝ` and `Units ℂ`, which in fields are precisely these groups. No change in meaning.
- No generalization or specialization occurs. The objects and the claim coincide.

  ∀ t : Set V, LinearIndependent K (fun x : t => (x : V)) → (t.Finite ∨ Countable t) := by
  sorry

Natural language for the theorem statement:
- Let K be a field and V a K-vector space.
- Assume there is a subset s ⊆ V such that s is countable (at most countable) and its K-span is the whole space V.
- Then for every subset t ⊆ V, if t is linearly independent (interpreted as the family of elements of the subtype t included in V is linearly independent), then t is finite or countable (at most countable).

Assessment against the original statement:
- Original: “Let V be a vector space which is spanned by a countably infinite set. Prove that every linearly independent subset of V is finite or countably infinite.”
- Code hypothesis: hs : Countable s (at most countable), not explicitly “countably infinite.” This is a slight generalization: it allows s to be finite as well as countably infinite. This does not harm the conclusion; in fact, the conclusion remains true (and is strictly stronger as a theorem) under the weaker assumption. Per the guidelines, slight generalizations are acceptable.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement concludes t.Finite ∨ Countable t. In Mathlib, Countable includes finite sets. The natural language’s “finite or countably infinite” is exactly the usual definition of “countable,” so the Lean conclusion matches the intended meaning. While the Lean phrasing does not enforce “infinite” in the second case, the disjunction “finite or countable” is equivalent to “countable,” aligning with the natural statement’s intended dichotomy.
- Quantification: The code takes s as a parameter satisfying the spanning/countability assumptions. This corresponds to the natural language “V is spanned by a countably infinite set” (i.e., there exists such an s); fixing such an s is a standard formalization and is faithful.
- Technical details: Standard Mathlib notions are used: Field/Module, Submodule.span K s = ⊤ for spanning, LinearIndependent on the subtype coercion, and Countable/Finiite for sets. No vacuous or placeholder definitions. The proof is omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Final comparison:
- Only discrepancy: “countably infinite” vs. “countable” in the hypothesis on s. The Lean code assumes merely countable, which is a slight generalization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- Conclusion faithfully matches the intended meaning (“finite or countably infinite” ≡ “countable”).

Therefore, the code is an essentially faithful formalization with a mild generalization in the hypothesis.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial Ideal`: Use mathlib and open namespaces for polynomials and ideals.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_5_16 (p : ℕ) [Fact (Nat.Prime p)] (q : Polynomial (ZMod p)) (n : ℕ) (hq_irred : Irreducible q) (hq_deg : q.natDegree = n) : ...` 
  • Parameters: p is a natural number with a typeclass witness that p is prime; q is a polynomial over ZMod p; n is a natural number; hypotheses: q is irreducible and has natural degree n.
  • Conclusion: A conjunction of three statements about the quotient ring `Polynomial (ZMod p) ⧸ Ideal.span ({q} : Set (Polynomial (ZMod p)))`:
    1) `IsField ...`: the quotient is a field.
    2) `Fintype ...`: the quotient has finitely many elements.
    3) `Fintype.card ... = p ^ n`: the number of elements is exactly p^n.
- The ideal used is `Ideal.span {q}`, i.e., the principal ideal (q), matching the usual notation (q(x)).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let F = Z_p with p prime, and q(x) ∈ F[x] irreducible of degree n. Show that F[x]/(q(x)) is a field with exactly p^n elements.
- Lean code: Takes F = ZMod p with p prime; q ∈ (ZMod p)[x] irreducible, degree n; concludes the quotient by (q) is a field and has cardinality p^n. This precisely matches the statement. The extra separate statement `Fintype ...` is implied by the cardinality claim and is consistent, not a discrepancy.

Step 3: Final check for mismatches or red flags.
- The quotient ring is exactly F[x]/(q). Using `Ideal.span {q}` is standard for the principal ideal (q).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions.
- Degree handling: `hq_deg : q.natDegree = n` encodes ""degree n"" correctly; irreducibility ensures q is nonconstant (so n ≥ 1 implicitly), consistent with the math.
- Base field F identified as `ZMod p` with p prime, matching Z_p.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with no substantive discrepancies.

  Natural language: Let G be a finite group, and let H be a subgroup of G (also finite). Assume the order of G satisfies |G| > 2. Then the order of H is not equal to |G| − 1.

- The natural language statement says: “Prove that G cannot have a subgroup H with |H| = n − 1, where n = |G| > 2.” This is exactly the assertion that, for a finite group G with |G| > 2, no subgroup has order |G| − 1.
- The Lean lemma asserts, for arbitrary H ≤ G, that |H| ≠ |G| − 1 under the hypothesis |G| > 2. This is a universal version of “cannot have,” which is logically equivalent to the intended statement.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: Bring in Mathlib and equivalence/permutation machinery.

This is the standard definition of transitivity for a permutation group.
- `theorem exists_derangement_of_transitive (G : Subgroup (Perm A)) (htrans : IsTransitive G) (hne : Fintype.card A > 1) : ∃ σ : Perm A, σ ∈ G ∧ ∀ a : A, σ a ≠ a := by sorry`: States that if `G` is a subgroup of `Perm A` acting transitively on finite `A` with `|A| > 1`, then there exists a permutation `σ ∈ G` with no fixed points, i.e., `∀ a, σ a ≠ a` (a derangement). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for a translation audit.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: A transitive permutation group `G` on finite `A` with `|A| > 1` has some `σ ∈ G` such that `σ(a) ≠ a` for all `a ∈ A`.
- Lean: Exactly the same content: `G : Subgroup (Perm A)` (a permutation group on `A`), `IsTransitive G` as defined, `Fintype.card A > 1`, and existence of `σ ∈ G` with no fixed points.

Checks and potential discrepancies:
- The auxiliary definition `IsTransitive` is legitimate and standard, not vacuous.
- Using `Subgroup (Perm A)` precisely models a permutation group.
- The cardinality condition `Fintype.card A > 1` faithfully encodes `|A| > 1`.
- The conclusion uses `∀ a : A, σ a ≠ a`, which is the derangement property required.
- No extraneous assumptions or restrictions are introduced; no generalization or specialization beyond the original statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library.
- The docstring explains the intent: show that for n > 1, ZMod n is not a group under multiplication by showing that not every element is a unit (e.g., 0 is not a unit).
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_1_1_5 (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) : ¬(∀ x : ZMod n, IsUnit x) := by sorry` translates to: For any natural number n with 1 < n, it is not the case that every element x in ZMod n is a unit (multiplicatively invertible).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that for all n > 1, Z/nZ is not a group under multiplication of residue classes.” In algebraic terms, a monoid is a group iff every element is invertible. ZMod n (the ring of residue classes modulo n) already has a multiplicative monoid structure; showing that not every element is a unit (invertible) is exactly the obstruction to it being a group under that multiplication. The Lean statement `¬(∀ x : ZMod n, IsUnit x)` precisely expresses that there exists some residue class (indeed 0) that does not have a multiplicative inverse. Thus the formal statement is equivalent to the original claim.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Quantifiers: both have “for all n > 1.” Matches Lean’s `(hn : 1 < n)`.
- Object: ZMod n is the standard Lean encoding of Z/nZ.
- Property: “not a group under multiplication” is equivalent to “not every element is a unit” in this context. The Lean theorem precisely asserts this.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it uses Mathlib’s genuine `ZMod` and `IsUnit`.
Therefore, the translation is legitimate and faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_2_14 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: Let G be a finite group.
- Hypothesis `h_sub : ∀ k : ℕ, k ∣ Fintype.card G → ∃ (H : Subgroup G) (s : Fintype (H : Type)), Fintype.card (H : Type) = k`:
  For every natural number k that divides the order of G, there exists a subgroup H of G such that the number of elements of H is exactly k. The `s : Fintype (H : Type)` is a technical witness that H is finite (so its cardinality makes sense), which is standard; it does not change the mathematical content.
- Hypothesis `h_comp : ¬ Nat.Prime (Fintype.card G) ∧ Fintype.card G > 1`:
  The order of G is composite, encoded as “not prime and greater than 1.”
- Conclusion `¬ IsSimpleGroup G`:
  G is not simple.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “Let G be a finite group of composite order n with the property that G has a subgroup of order k for each positive integer k dividing n. Prove that G is not simple.”
- The Lean hypotheses match: G finite; order composite (¬prime ∧ > 1); for each k dividing |G|, there is a subgroup of order k. The positivity condition on k is implicitly satisfied because if k ∣ |G| and |G| > 1 in ℕ, then k ≠ 0. The code’s divisibility condition already restricts to valid k, and includes k = 1 and k = |G| as expected.
- Conclusion matches: G is not simple.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: all terms are from Mathlib; no fake definitions are introduced. The presence of `sorry` is only in the proof, not in definitions.
- The slight technical addition of providing a `Fintype` instance for H is standard and faithful to expressing “order k.”
- No extra or missing assumptions relative to the statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code: There is no Lean code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""), so there are no lines to translate into natural language.

2) Faithfulness assessment: Since no Lean code is present, there is nothing to compare against the natural language statement (""Prove that a group of order 200 has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup""). Thus, the translation cannot be faithful.

3) Final check: The mathematical statement concerns the existence and normality of a Sylow 5-subgroup in a group of order 200. With no Lean code supplied, the two are not comparable; the formal component is missing entirely. Therefore, this fails the criteria for a faithful translation.

2) Fidelity assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the classical theorem: every subgroup of a solvable group is solvable. It quantifies over an arbitrary group G, an arbitrary subgroup H ≤ G, and asserts `IsSolvable H` from `IsSolvable G`.
- It uses Mathlib's legitimate definitions: `Subgroup G` for subgroups and `IsSolvable` as the solvability predicate on groups. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.

- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_7_1_11 {R : Type*} [Ring R] [IsDomain R] {x : R} (h : x * x = 1) : x = 1 ∨ x = -1 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with ring structure and which is an integral domain (`[IsDomain R]`), and any element x ∈ R such that x * x = 1 (i.e., x^2 = 1), we have x = 1 or x = -1.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Hypotheses: The natural statement assumes R is an integral domain. In Mathlib, `[IsDomain R]` encodes the integral domain condition (nontrivial ring with no zero divisors; in Mathlib this is typically for commutative semirings/rings, but even if it allowed noncommutativity, the conclusion still holds). The code also assumes `[Ring R]`, which is compatible and standard.
- Condition x^2 = 1 is expressed as `h : x * x = 1`.
- Conclusion x = ±1 is expressed as `x = 1 ∨ x = -1`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement with an omitted proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions.

3) Final comparison:
- The code precisely states the same mathematical claim as the natural language statement. If anything, using `[IsDomain R]` together with `[Ring R]` is either exactly the integral domain assumption or a slight generalization (allowing the standard argument to go through), which is acceptable by the guidelines.
- There are no discrepancies: quantification over R and x is correct, the hypothesis and conclusion match exactly.

- The theorem declaration:

  - `∃ (p : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ Nonempty (G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p))`
    States: There exists a natural number p such that p is prime and there exists a group isomorphism between G and `Multiplicative (ZMod p)`. Here, `ZMod p` is the additive cyclic group of order p (integers modulo p), and `Multiplicative` is the standard wrapper that converts the additive group structure into a multiplicative one, so this expresses that G is (multiplicatively) isomorphic to the additive cyclic group of order p.
  - `by sorry`: Proof omitted (allowed per the task; we only check the statement).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that if G is an abelian simple group then G ≅ Z_p for some prime p (do not assume G is a finite group).""
- The Lean statement assumes G is a commutative (abelian) group and simple, and concludes existence of a prime p and a group isomorphism `G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p)`. This is a faithful formalization: in Lean, `ZMod p` models the cyclic group of order p under addition; wrapping with `Multiplicative` yields a multiplicative group isomorphic to the additive `ZMod p`, matching the informal ""G ≅ Z_p"".
- The statement does not assume finiteness; rather, it concludes isomorphism to `ZMod p` for prime p, which indeed forces finiteness, aligning with the parenthetical comment.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions (`IsSimpleGroup`, `ZMod`, `Nat.Prime`, `≃*`, `Multiplicative`).
- The only potential notational difference is using `Multiplicative (ZMod p)` instead of writing explicitly the additive group `ZMod p`. This is standard and equivalent for expressing a group isomorphism in multiplicative notation. There is no substantive mismatch.
- Redundancy `[Group G] [CommGroup G]` is harmless and does not change meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a legitimate, faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the math library.
- The comment block restates the exercise: a Boolean ring is one where `a^2 = a` for all `a`, and we want to prove it is commutative.
- `theorem boolean_ring_comm {R : Type _} [Ring R] (h : ∀ a : R, a * a = a) : ∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: For any type `R` with a ring structure `[Ring R]`, if every element is idempotent under multiplication (`∀ a, a * a = a`), then multiplication in `R` is commutative (`∀ a b, a * b = b * a`). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypothesis `h : ∀ a : R, a * a = a` exactly formalizes “a^2 = a for all a ∈ R”. Using `a * a` instead of `a ^ 2` is a standard and equivalent way to express the same in noncommutative rings.
- The conclusion `∀ a b : R, a * b = b * a` exactly states that the ring is commutative (with respect to multiplication).
- The context `[Ring R]` matches the conventional setting where “ring” in mathlib is not assumed commutative a priori and includes `1`. The natural language statement typically also uses this convention; even if one allowed rings without `1`, the theorem remains correct, so this is at worst a mild specialization, not a mismatch.
- The theorem states the commutativity property directly (rather than asserting `[IsCommutative R (·*·)]` or `[CommRing R]`), which is an equivalent way to state the ring is commutative for the purposes of this exercise.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; no placeholders other than the unfilled proof (`sorry`).
- The formal statement precisely captures the natural language claim: Boolean ring (all elements idempotent) implies commutativity.
- Minor technical note: `[Ring R]` assumes a `1`, while the natural language did not explicitly specify presence or absence of unity. This does not change the content of the claim and is standard in mathlib; the translation remains faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This states: For any integer n, if there exist rationals a and b such that a^2 + b^2 (computed in ℚ) equals n (viewed as a rational), then there exist integers x and y such that x^2 + y^2 (computed in ℤ) equals n. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean theorem exactly formalizes the natural language statement: it universally quantifies over integers n and asserts that if n is a sum of two rational squares, then it is a sum of two integer squares. The coercion `(n : ℚ)` ensures the equation is in ℚ when needed. There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; only the theorem statement.

3) Final check:
The two statements match precisely. No extra assumptions or restrictions are added; no generalization or specialization beyond the intended content. Edge cases (e.g., negative n) are handled implicitly the same way: the hypothesis would be false, making the implication trivially true, which aligns with the natural language implication.

- `def commutator_of_G_H (H : Subgroup G) : Subgroup G := Subgroup.closure { x : G | ∃ g h : G, h ∈ (H : Set G) ∧ x = g * h * g⁻¹ * h⁻¹ }`:
  This defines the subgroup [G, H] as the subgroup generated by all commutators g h g^{-1} h^{-1} with g ∈ G and h ∈ H. This matches the standard definition of the commutator subgroup [G,H].
- `theorem subgroup_normal_iff_commutator_le (H : Subgroup G) : (∀ g x, x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H) ↔ commutator_of_G_H H ≤ H := by sorry`:
  This states that H is invariant under conjugation by any g ∈ G (i.e., ∀ g ∈ G, ∀ x ∈ H, g x g^{-1} ∈ H), which is exactly the usual condition for H being normal, if and only if the commutator subgroup [G, H] is contained in H. The proof is omitted (`sorry`) but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: a subgroup H of G is normal if and only if [G, H] ≤ H. The Lean theorem expresses normality via the standard conjugation-closure predicate `(∀ g x, x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H)` and asserts its equivalence with `commutator_of_G_H H ≤ H`. The definition of `commutator_of_G_H` matches [G, H] as the subgroup generated by commutators with g ∈ G and h ∈ H. This is a faithful translation.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous placeholders: the commutator subgroup is defined legitimately via `Subgroup.closure` of actual commutators. There is no fake definition like `:= True`.
- The left side characterizes normality in a standard way, even though it does not use Mathlib's `Subgroup.Normal`. This is acceptable and faithful.
- The statement direction and content exactly match the natural language theorem. No extra assumptions or restrictions are introduced. No generalization/specialization discrepancies.

  In words: The polynomial over the integers given by X^6 + 30 X^5 − 15 X^3 + 6 X − 120 is irreducible in ℤ[x]. Here, `X` is the polynomial variable, and `C (n : Int)` embeds the integer coefficient n into the polynomial ring. The ring is explicitly `Polynomial Int`, i.e., ℤ[x].

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to prove that x^6 + 30x^5 − 15x^3 + 6x − 120 is irreducible in ℤ[x].
- The Lean statement asserts exactly that irreducibility in `Polynomial Int` of the same polynomial. All coefficients and terms match: degree 6 term 1, degree 5 term 30, degree 3 term −15, degree 1 term 6, and constant term −120; missing degrees have zero coefficients implicitly. This is a direct, faithful formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The presence of `sorry` only indicates the proof is omitted; it does not affect the statement’s faithfulness to the original claim. The ambient ring ℤ[x] is correctly represented as `Polynomial Int`.
- No discrepancies in the polynomial or in the notion of irreducibility. The problems are the same.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language and assess it.
- variable {G : Type u} [Group G]: We work in a group G.
- def leftRel (H : Subgroup G) : G → G → Prop := fun a b => (b⁻¹ * a) ∈ H: Define a relation on G: a ~ b iff b⁻¹ a ∈ H. This is the standard relation whose equivalence classes are left cosets of H in G.
- def leftRelOn (H K : Subgroup G) : K → K → Prop := fun a b => ((b : G)⁻¹ * (a : G)) ∈ H: Define a relation on the subgroup K: for a, b ∈ K, a ~ b iff b⁻¹ a ∈ H. When H ≤ K, this gives cosets of H inside K; without H ≤ K it classifies intersections K ∩ aH. The intended use here is with H ≤ K.
- def leftSetoid (H : Subgroup G) : Setoid G := Setoid.mk (leftRel H) (by sorry): Declare the setoid of left cosets of H in G, but the proof that leftRel H is an equivalence relation is omitted via sorry. Conceptually correct, but uses a placeholder proof.
- def leftSetoidOn (H K : Subgroup G) : Setoid K := Setoid.mk (leftRelOn H K) (by sorry): Similarly, the setoid on K induced by H, with the equivalence proof omitted (sorry). Again conceptually correct if H ≤ K, but relies on a placeholder proof.
- def leftCosets (H : Subgroup G) : Type u := Quotient (leftSetoid H): The type of left cosets G/H as a quotient by the setoid.
- def leftCosetsIn (H K : Subgroup G) : Type u := Quotient (leftSetoidOn H K): The type of left cosets of H in K (i.e., K/H) as a quotient by the setoid on K.
- theorem index_mul_cardinal {H K : Subgroup G} (hHK : H ≤ K) : Cardinal.mk (leftCosets H) = Cardinal.mk (leftCosets K) * Cardinal.mk (leftCosetsIn H K) := by sorry: States that if H ≤ K ≤ G, then the cardinality of G/H equals the product of the cardinalities of G/K and K/H. This matches |G:H| = |G:K| · |K:H|, with indices interpreted as cardinals. The proof is omitted via sorry.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- The original statement: For H ≤ K ≤ G, prove |G:H| = |G:K| · |K:H| without assuming finiteness. The Lean version models indices as Cardinal.mk of left-coset quotient types—appropriate for infinite groups—and includes the assumption hHK : H ≤ K. K ≤ G is implicit since K is a Subgroup G. The equation exactly matches the desired equality.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness and discrepancies.
- Semantic faithfulness: The statements and constructions (relations, cosets, cardinals) align with the mathematical statement.
- Issues per guidelines: The setoid constructions leftSetoid and leftSetoidOn use `by sorry` for the equivalence proofs, which are auxiliary definition components. The guidelines specify that auxiliary definitions filled with sorry constitute a red flag and cause the translation to fail. Although the relations themselves are correct and non-vacuous, the use of sorry in these definitions violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and not placeholders.
- The main theorem also has `by sorry` for its proof, which is acceptable per the task's allowance of omitted proofs, but the auxiliary uses of sorry are not.

Conclusion: While the content is essentially a faithful formalization of |G:H| = |G:K| · |K:H| in terms of cardinalities, the presence of `sorry` in the setoid definitions counts as an invalid placeholder per the auditing guidelines, so the translation fails on that technical ground.

  Natural language: For any finite group G of order 312, there exists a subgroup H of G such that |H| = 13 and H is normal in G.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language claim to prove: A group of order 312 has a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing its order.
- The Lean theorem asserts existence of a normal subgroup of order 13. Since 13 is the highest power of 13 dividing 312 (indeed 13^1 || 312), any subgroup of order 13 is a Sylow 13-subgroup. Thus the theorem proves a stronger, more specific instance (p = 13) of the original statement. This is a valid specialization that implies the original claim.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it uses standard Mathlib structures (`Subgroup`, `Normal`, `Nat.card`). The proof is omitted via `sorry`, but per the instructions we only assess the statement.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: existence of a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some p | 312.
- Lean: existence of a normal subgroup of order 13 (hence a normal Sylow 13-subgroup). This is stronger and implies the original. No discrepancies that weaken the claim; rather, it strengthens it. Therefore the translation is faithful (indeed more specific but acceptable per guidelines).

f(x) g(x) has integer coefficients, then the product of any coefficient of g(x)
with any coefficient of f(x) is an integer.

We state the hypothesis as: for all n, (f * g).coeff n is an integer when viewed
as a rational number, i.e. there exists z : Int with (f*g).coeff n = (z : ℚ).
The conclusion is: for all i j, f.coeff i * g.coeff j is an integer (as a rational).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib; nothing unusual.
- Docstring explains the intended translation: f, g ∈ ℚ[x], (f*g) has integer coefficients, conclude every product of a coefficient of f with a coefficient of g is an integer. It clarifies the Lean formulation: coefficients of (f*g) are equal to some integer cast to ℚ; conclusion: for all i, j, f.coeff i * g.coeff j is an integer in ℚ.
- `open Polynomial`: Opens the polynomial namespace.
- The theorem: `theorem dummit_foote_exercise_9_3_2 (f g : Polynomial ℚ) (h : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ z : ℤ, (f * g).coeff n = (z : ℚ)) : ∀ i j : ℕ, ∃ z : ℤ, (f.coeff i * g.coeff j : ℚ) = (z : ℚ) := by sorry`
  - Hypotheses: `f g : Polynomial ℚ` means f and g are polynomials with rational coefficients.
  - `h : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ z : ℤ, (f * g).coeff n = (z : ℚ)` states that for each coefficient index n, the nth coefficient of f*g (viewed as a rational number) equals some integer cast to ℚ. This is precisely the statement that f*g has integer coefficients.
  - Conclusion: `∀ i j : ℕ, ∃ z : ℤ, (f.coeff i * g.coeff j : ℚ) = (z : ℚ)` says for any indices i, j, the product of the ith coefficient of f and the jth coefficient of g is equal to some integer cast to ℚ, i.e., is an integer.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: f and g are polynomials with rational coefficients; f*g has integer coefficients; conclude the product of any coefficient of g with any coefficient of f is an integer.
- Lean: Precisely matches this with standard Mathlib notions: polynomials over ℚ, coefficient function `coeff : Polynomial ℚ → ℕ → ℚ`, integer-valued coefficients represented as equality to `(z : ℚ)`. The universal quantification over all i, j ensures any pair of coefficients’ product is an integer.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Indexing by ℕ for coefficients is standard; includes zero coefficients, which is consistent with “any coefficient.” The order of multiplication (f.coeff i * g.coeff j) vs. the English (coeff of g times coeff of f) is immaterial.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same. No changes in generality, no missing hypotheses, and no extraneous conditions. The encoding of “integer coefficients” via existence of z : ℤ with equality in ℚ is correct.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib; open Subgroup; variable {G : Type _} [Group G]: We work in a general group G.
- def IsCharacteristic (H : Subgroup G) : Prop := ∀ (f : G ≃* G) (x : G), x ∈ H ↔ f x ∈ H: Defines ""H is characteristic"" to mean that for every group automorphism f of G and every element x, x belongs to H if and only if f(x) belongs to H. This is equivalent to saying f(H) = H for all automorphisms f, i.e., H is fixed by every automorphism.
- theorem characteristic_subgroup_normal (H : Subgroup G) (h : IsCharacteristic H) : ∀ g x, x ∈ H → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ H := by sorry: States that if H is characteristic then for every g, and every x ∈ H, the conjugate g x g⁻¹ lies in H. That is the usual closure-under-conjugation condition characterizing normal subgroups.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that characteristic subgroups are normal."" The theorem asserts that a characteristic subgroup is invariant under conjugation by any element, i.e., for all g and x ∈ H, g x g⁻¹ ∈ H. This is exactly the standard property defining normality. Therefore, the theorem statement matches the intended result.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- The definition of characteristic used is standard and non-vacuous.
- The conclusion is stated as the conjugation-invariance property rather than explicitly as Subgroup.Normal H, but these are equivalent characterizations of normality. There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions or placeholders apart from the proof (which is allowed for this task). Thus, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MvPolynomial`: bring in Mathlib and open the multivariable polynomial namespace.
- The theorem states: `¬ ∃ p : MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ, Ideal.span ({X (0 : Fin 2), X (1 : Fin 2)} : Set (MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ)) = Ideal.span ({p} : Set (MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ))`. In words: In the ring of multivariable polynomials over ℚ in two variables indexed by `Fin 2` (i.e., ℚ[x, y]), there does not exist a single polynomial p such that the ideal generated by X(0) and X(1) (i.e., the ideal (x, y)) equals the principal ideal generated by p. Equivalently, the ideal (x, y) is not principal.
- The `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided; this is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: Prove that (x, y) is not a principal ideal in ℚ[x, y].
- The Lean statement uses `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` to model ℚ[x, y] with variables `X 0` and `X 1` standing for x and y, and asserts that the ideal `Ideal.span {X 0, X 1}` is not equal to any principal ideal `Ideal.span {p}`. This is exactly the formal expression of “(x, y) is not principal.”

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement is given.
- The use of `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ` accurately models ℚ[x, y].
- The formulation via `Ideal.span ({X 0, X 1})` and the negation of existence of `p` with equality to `Ideal.span {p}` matches the mathematical content precisely.

  ∀ φ : G ≃* G, Subgroup.map (φ.toMonoidHom) H = H := by sorry",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Context: G is a group, H is a subgroup of G, and P is a predicate on subgroups of G.
- Theorem statement unique_subgroup_property_characteristic:
  Hypotheses:
  • h_unique : ∀ K, P K → K = H. This says: whenever a subgroup K satisfies P, then K must equal H. This is a uniqueness statement without asserting that H actually satisfies P.
  • h_invariant : ∀ φ : G ≃* G, ∀ K : Subgroup G, P K → P (Subgroup.map (φ.toMonoidHom) K). This says: the property P is preserved under automorphisms (mapping by φ).
  Conclusion:
  • ∀ φ : G ≃* G, Subgroup.map (φ.toMonoidHom) H = H. For every automorphism φ of G, the image of H under φ equals H. This is exactly the definition that H is characteristic.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: “If H is the unique subgroup of a given order in a group G prove H is characteristic in G.”
- The Lean theorem generalizes from the specific property “having a given order” to an arbitrary property P preserved by automorphisms, which is a reasonable and standard generalization. Under this generalization, to model the original statement one would take P(K) to be “K has the given order,” which is indeed preserved by automorphisms.
- However, the natural language statement entails both uniqueness and existence: “H is the unique subgroup of a given order” means (i) H has that order and (ii) any subgroup with that order equals H. In the Lean hypotheses, h_unique expresses only (ii) (at most one subgroup has P), but there is no assumption that P H holds (existence). For the standard argument to go through, one needs P H to deduce P (map φ H) by invariance and then apply uniqueness to conclude map φ H = H. The current Lean statement omits the assumption P H and thus strengthens the result improperly: it would (if proved) claim H is characteristic even in cases where no subgroup satisfies P at all (i.e., h_unique holds vacuously), which does not correspond to the original mathematical claim.

Step 3: Final check: are the two statements the same?
- They are not exactly the same. The Lean statement is an intended generalization but is missing the crucial existence assumption P H. This omission makes the theorem’s hypotheses strictly weaker than the natural-language hypotheses, and the resulting statement is a non-faithful strengthening of the original.
- Everything else aligns: the conclusion that map φ H = H for all automorphisms is the correct formalization of “H is characteristic,” and the framework of a P preserved by automorphisms correctly captures “given order.” There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only issue is the missing P H.

Verdict
- Not fully faithful due to missing existence (P H). Otherwise it’s a good generalization format. Hence near-pass, but not faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library.
- `open Ideal` opens the Ideal namespace to use ideal-related notation and definitions conveniently.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem zmod_p_ideal_nilpotent {p m : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hm : 1 ≤ m) : (Ideal.span { (p : ZMod (p ^ m)) } : Ideal (ZMod (p ^ m))) ^ m = ⊥ := by sorry`
  translates to: For natural numbers p and m, assuming p is a prime number and m ≥ 1, the m-th power of the ideal generated by the element p (viewed inside the ring ZMod (p^m), i.e., ℤ/p^mℤ) equals the zero ideal. Here `(Ideal.span { (p : ZMod (p ^ m)) })` is the ideal (p) inside ℤ/p^mℤ, and `^ m = ⊥` asserts its m-th power is the zero ideal.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asserts: In the ring ℤ/p^mℤ, the ideal p ℤ / p^m ℤ is a nilpotent ideal. Concretely, since p^m = 0 in ℤ/p^mℤ, one expects (p)^m = (p^m) = 0, so the ideal generated by p is nilpotent. The Lean statement proves exactly the stronger, concrete claim that the m-th power of the ideal generated by p is the zero ideal. This directly implies the ideal is nilpotent.

3) Comparison and potential differences:
- The Lean code assumes `hp : Nat.Prime p` and `hm : 1 ≤ m`. The natural language uses the notation p and p^m, which typically presumes p is a prime and m ≥ 1; these are natural and harmless specializations consistent with the intended meaning. The result itself does not rely essentially on primality for nilpotence of the ideal generated by p in ℤ/p^mℤ, but requiring primeness does not weaken the correctness; it's a slight specialization that still proves the intended statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement (with a placeholder proof), so no red flags.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful and even slightly stronger formalization of the claim that the ideal p ℤ / p^m ℤ in ℤ/p^mℤ is nilpotent, by explicitly stating its m-th power is zero.

This exactly expands the polynomial ((X+2)^p - 2^p)/X: indeed, (X+2)^p = Σ_{k=0}^p binom(p,k) X^k 2^{p-k}; subtract 2^p removes the k=0 term, leaving Σ_{k=1}^p binom(p,k) 2^{p-k} X^k; dividing by X yields Σ_{k=1}^p binom(p,k) 2^{p-k} X^{k-1}. Setting j=k-1 gives the definition used.
- Theorem statement: `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_9_4_2d (p : ℕ) [Fact (Nat.Prime p)] (hp : p ≠ 2) : Irreducible (g p) := by sorry`
  Interpreted: For a natural number p that is prime (via the typeclass `[Fact (Nat.Prime p)]`) and not equal to 2 (so p is an odd prime), the polynomial g p is irreducible in ℤ[x]. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural-language statement: Prove that ((x+2)^p - 2^p)/x is irreducible in ℤ[x] for p an odd prime.
- The code defines g p to be the explicit expanded form of that same polynomial in ℤ[x], then states that g p is irreducible under the hypothesis that p is a prime and p ≠ 2 (equivalent to p being an odd prime). Thus the mathematical content matches exactly.

3) Final comparison and any differences:
- The only potential difference is that the code does not explicitly assert g p = ((X+2)^p - 2^p)/X; instead it defines g p by the expanded coefficient formula. Since the formula is exactly the expansion of that quotient, this is a faithful reformulation, not a change in meaning.
- The assumptions `[Fact (Nat.Prime p)]` and `hp : p ≠ 2` correspond precisely to “p is an odd prime.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `g` is a concrete polynomial. The theorem statement matches the intended irreducibility claim in ℤ[x].

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural-language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:

- The Lean statement asserts irreducibility of `X 0 ^ 2 + X 1 ^ 2 − C 1` in `MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℚ`, which is the standard formalization of Q[x,y] (two-variable polynomial ring over ℚ) up to renaming variables. Hence it is a faithful translation.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_4_5_28 (G : Type _) [Group G] [Fintype G]` introduces a finite group G.
- `(hG : Fintype.card G = 105)` assumes the order of G is 105.
- `(P : Subgroup G) [Fintype P] (hP_card : Fintype.card P = 3)` fixes a subgroup P of G of order 3 (finite).
- `(hP_normal : ∀ g : G, ∀ p : P, g * (p : G) * g⁻¹ ∈ P)` assumes P is normal in G, i.e., closed under conjugation by any element of G.
- `: ∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x` states the conclusion that G is abelian (every pair of elements commute).

Step 2: Assess if this matches the natural language statement.
- A Sylow 3-subgroup in a group of order 105 has order 3 (since 105 = 3·5·7 and the 3-Sylow has size 3). Thus, any subgroup P of order 3 is a Sylow 3-subgroup.
- The normality hypothesis is expressed correctly with `∀ g : G, ∀ p : P, g * (p : G) * g⁻¹ ∈ P`, which is equivalent to P being normal.
- The conclusion `∀ x y, x * y = y * x` is precisely that G is abelian.
- The code does not introduce any vacuous or placeholder definitions; it merely states the theorem with hypotheses corresponding to the natural language statement and omits the proof with `sorry`.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
- The natural language says: If a Sylow 3-subgroup of G is normal, then G is abelian. The Lean statement fixes a subgroup P of order 3 (hence a Sylow 3-subgroup) and assumes it is normal, then concludes G is abelian. This is a faithful formalization. The universal quantification over P in the Lean statement is standard and does not change the meaning, since the conclusion is about G alone and does not depend on which P was chosen.
- No secondary or vacuous definitions are present; all assumptions are mathematically standard and legitimate in Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully states the natural language theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Dummit_Foote_exercise_8_1_12 (N : ℕ) (hN : 0 < N) (M M1 : Int) (d d' : ℕ)` introduces: a positive natural number N, integers M and M1, and natural numbers d and d'. This matches the problem's N > 0, M, M1 ∈ ℤ, and d an integer (here specialized to ℕ), d' the inverse mod φ(N).
- `(hd : Nat.gcd d (Nat.totient N) = 1)` encodes “d is relatively prime to φ(N)”.
- `(hrel : Int.gcd M (N : Int) = 1)` encodes “M is relatively prime to N”.
- `(hM1 : Int.ModEq (N : Int) M1 (M ^ d))` encodes the congruence M1 ≡ M^d (mod N).
- `(hinv : (d * d') % (Nat.totient N) = 1)` intends to encode “d' is the inverse of d modulo φ(N)”, i.e., d d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(N)). Note: this is a stronger formulation than mere congruence, because it asserts the canonical remainder equals 1.
- Conclusion: `Int.ModEq (N : Int) M (M1 ^ d')` is exactly M ≡ M1^{d'} (mod N).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- All the mathematical objects match the natural-language statement (N positive, M coprime to N, d coprime to φ(N), congruence M1 ≡ M^d mod N, and the goal M ≡ M1^{d'} mod N).
- Using Int.ModEq matches modular congruence modulo N.
- Making d, d' natural numbers is a reasonable specialization (exponents are natural in this context); the original says “integer” but negative exponents over integers are not intended, so this is appropriate.
- The only subtle difference: `(d * d') % φ(N) = 1` is stronger than `d d' ≡ 1 (mod φ(N))`, especially when φ(N) = 1 (i.e., N ∈ {1,2}). In those cases, `≡ 1 (mod 1)` is always true, but `a % 1 = 1` is impossible. So the Lean statement slightly specializes the hypothesis by excluding the modulus-1 case. This is a mild strengthening and does not introduce vacuity or misrepresentation for φ(N) ≥ 2.
- No auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct formalization. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation checking.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical content and structure match the natural-language statement. The only discrepancy is the stronger inverse condition via `% = 1`, which slightly specializes the statement by effectively requiring φ(N) > 1. This is a minor specialization and acceptable under the guidelines.

Overall, the code is a faithful formalization with a small, acceptable specialization.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open MonoidAlgebra`: Using Mathlib and opening the MonoidAlgebra namespace.
- `variable {R : Type _} {G : Type _} [Semiring R] [Group G] [Fintype G]`: Fix a semiring R, a group G, and assume G is finite (Fintype G). This matches the natural language assumption of a finite group, and allows a slightly more general coefficient semiring than a ring.
- `noncomputable def N : MonoidAlgebra R G := (Finset.univ : Finset G).sum fun g => MonoidAlgebra.single g (1 : R)`: Defines the element N in the group ring R[G] (realized as MonoidAlgebra R G) to be the sum over all g in G of the basis element corresponding to g with coefficient 1_R. This is exactly the formal counterpart of N = g1 + ... + gn.
- `theorem N_is_central : ∀ x : MonoidAlgebra R G, Commute (N : MonoidAlgebra R G) x := by sorry`: States that for every x in R[G], N commutes with x, i.e., N is central in the group ring. Using Commute captures the center condition.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Let G be finite with elements g1, ..., gn. Prove N = g1 + ... + gn is in the center of the group ring RG.
- The code defines exactly this N as the sum of all group elements with coefficient 1 and asserts it commutes with every element in R[G]. This is exactly the center condition.
- The use of MonoidAlgebra R G for the group ring and allowing R to be a Semiring is a standard generalization; the statement remains valid and is acceptable per the guidelines.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Minor generalization: R is a Semiring instead of a Ring, and MonoidAlgebra is used (standard in Mathlib). This does not change the meaning materially and is acceptable.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: N is a genuine definition; the theorem statement itself (with `sorry` proof) is fine for translation auditing.
- Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variables {G : Type*} [Group G]` sets up an arbitrary group G.
- The theorem takes elements `r s : G` and a natural number `n : ℕ`, with hypotheses:
  - `h_rn : r ^ n = 1`: the rotation `r` has order dividing n.
  - `h_s2 : s ^ 2 = 1`: the reflection `s` has order 2.
  - `h_conj : s * r * s = r⁻¹`: conjugation by `s` inverts `r` (equivalent to `srs⁻¹ = r⁻¹` since `s = s⁻¹`).
  - `h_gen : Subgroup.closure ({r, s} : Set G) = ⊤`: `r` and `s` generate the whole group G.
- Conclusion: For any subgroup `H` of G, if `⟨r⟩ ≤ H` and `H ≠ ⟨r⟩`, then `H = ⊤`. In words: any subgroup properly containing the rotation subgroup must be the whole group.

Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: “Show that the subgroup of all rotations in a dihedral group is a maximal subgroup.” In a dihedral group with generators `r` (rotation) and `s` (reflection), the rotation subgroup is `⟨r⟩`. Saying it is maximal means: it is a proper subgroup of G and any subgroup strictly between it and G is equal to G, i.e., there is no intermediate subgroup.
- The code captures the “no intermediate subgroup” part: for any H containing `⟨r⟩`, if `H ≠ ⟨r⟩`, then `H = ⊤`.
- However, the code does not assert that `⟨r⟩ ≠ ⊤` (properness). Therefore it does not fully formalize “maximal subgroup” in the usual sense (proper + no intermediate). The statement in Lean would be vacuously true even in degenerate cases where `⟨r⟩ = ⊤` (e.g., possible when n=1 or 2 with s=r), which are not genuine dihedral groups in the standard sense n ≥ 3.
- Additionally, the code uses a presentation-style characterization (relations and generation) instead of Mathlib’s `DihedralGroup` type. That is acceptable, but it only assumes `r^n=1` (order divides n), not that the order of `r` is exactly n, and allows n to be any natural (including 0), so it includes degenerate cases.

Final comparison:
- Same core idea: The subgroup of rotations `⟨r⟩` is maximal in the sense that any larger subgroup is the whole group. This is faithful to the maximality aspect.
- Differences:
  1) Missing the explicit properness condition `⟨r⟩ ≠ ⊤`, which is part of the standard definition of a maximal subgroup.
  2) The hypotheses allow degenerate non-dihedral groups (e.g., n = 0, 1, or 2, or extra relations), so the scope is broader than “a dihedral group” in the usual sense (n ≥ 3 and |r| = n).

Given these, the translation is very close but not fully faithful due to the missing properness and allowance of degenerate cases. No vacuous or fake definitions are used.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `G` is a type with a group structure `[Group G]` and is finite `[Fintype G]`.
- Parameters: natural numbers `p q r` together with proofs they are primes (`Fact (Nat.Prime p)`, etc.). Hypotheses `hpq : p < q` and `hqr : q < r` encode p < q < r. The order of the group is specified as `Fintype.card G = p * q * r`.
- Goal (conclusion): There exists a subgroup `H : Subgroup G` such that:
  1) `Fintype (H : Type*)` — H is finite (redundant here since any subgroup of a finite group is finite, but harmless and automatic in Mathlib),
  2) `Fintype.card (H : Type*) = p ∨ ... = q ∨ ... = r` — the order of H is one of p, q, or r,
  3) `∀ g h, h ∈ H → g * h * g⁻¹ ∈ H` — H is normal (closed under conjugation by every element g of G).

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original claim: If |G| = p q r with distinct primes p < q < r, then G has a normal Sylow subgroup for either p, q, or r.
- In a group of order p q r (distinct primes), the Sylow p-subgroup has order p, the Sylow q-subgroup has order q, and the Sylow r-subgroup has order r. Any subgroup of order p (respectively q or r) is automatically a Sylow p- (resp. q-, r-) subgroup. Thus, exhibiting a normal subgroup of order p or q or r is exactly exhibiting a normal Sylow subgroup for one of those primes.
- The code’s conclusion is precisely: there exists a normal subgroup whose order is p or q or r. Therefore this is a faithful formalization of the statement.

Checks for red flags:
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib notions only.
- The extra conjunct `Fintype (H : Type*)` is redundant but automatically satisfied and does not change the mathematical content.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language claim.
