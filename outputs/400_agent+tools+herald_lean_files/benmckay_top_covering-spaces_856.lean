/-- Main statement (formalized as a placeholder): Let X be a path connected and locally simply
    connected space, Γ a group, and φ : π₁(X) → Γ a group homomorphism. Suppose Γ acts on a space
    X_φ giving a projection p_φ : X_φ → X. Then p_φ is a Γ-covering of X with Γ ≃ π₁(X), and any
    connected Γ-covering space Y → X arises from this construction for some φ. -/
