Take a free group action on a metric space X by a group of isometries Γ with discrete orbits.
Prove that the quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map.

This file gives a high-level formal translation of the statement. All technical predicates are left as
opaque propositions; the proof is omitted (``sorry'').
