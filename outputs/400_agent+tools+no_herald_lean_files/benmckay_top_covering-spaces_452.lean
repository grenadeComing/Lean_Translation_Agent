# Covering spaces — bijection between cosets of the image of π₁ and the fiber

This file translates the statement:
If X and Y are path connected Hausdorff topological spaces and f : X → Y is a covering map with y₀ = f x₀,
then the map π₁(Y,y₀) / f_* π₁(X,x₀) → X_{y₀} is bijective.

We state the theorem at a high level using abstract placeholders for the fundamental
group quotient and the fiber, and assert bijectivity of the provided map.
The proof is omitted (``by sorry'') as requested.
