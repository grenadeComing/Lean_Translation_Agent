Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space X has a universal
covering space. This file gives a high-level statement; the proof is omitted (sorry).

We provide a minimal placeholder predicate for "locally simply connected" so that the
statement type-checks in Lean. In a full development one would use the definitions from
Mathlib for covering maps and local simple connectivity.
