A translation of: Let X be a topological space and let x : [0,1] → X be a path.
Let x̄ denote the reverse path x̄(t) = x(1 - t). Prove that x * x̄ is homotopic
relative to {0,1} to the constant loop at x(0).

This file gives a formal statement placeholder using Mathlib's Path API.
The actual homotopy relation is represented here by a placeholder predicate
`homotopy_rel` (to be replaced by the appropriate definition in a full
formalisation). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
