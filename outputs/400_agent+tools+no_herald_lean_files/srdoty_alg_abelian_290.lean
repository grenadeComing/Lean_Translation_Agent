/-- Classification of finite abelian groups: every finite abelian (additive) group
    is (additively) isomorphic to a finite product of cyclic groups Z/nZ. -/
theorem finite_abelian_group_is_product_of_cyclic (G : Type*) [AddCommGroup G] [Fintype G] :
  ∃ (n : ℕ) (f : Fin n → ℕ), Nonempty (G ≃+ ∀ i, ZMod (f i)) := by sorry

/-- Informal statement (placeholder): If n = ∏_{j=1}^r p_j^{k_j} is the prime-power
    factorization of n, then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups
    of order n is p(k_1) * ... * p(k_r), where p(k) is the partition function.
    (This theorem is stated informally here; a full formalization would require defining
    the set of isomorphism classes and the partition-counting function.) -/
