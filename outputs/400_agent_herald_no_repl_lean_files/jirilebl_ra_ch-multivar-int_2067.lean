/-- Translation of the statement:

Let m^* be the outer measure on R^n defined by
  m^*(S) = inf { sum_{j=1}^\infty V(R_j) : S ⊆ ⋃_{j=1}^\infty R_j, R_j open rectangles }.

Define instead
  μ^*(S) = inf { sum_{j∈I} V(R_j) : S ⊆ ⋃_{j∈I} R_j, I finite or countably infinite, R_j open rectangles }.

Then for every S ⊆ R^n, μ^*(S) = m^*(S).

Remarks: the file below records the above statement in a form suitable for filling in a formal proof. We treat the ambient space as (Fin n → ℝ) and we keep the notions of ``volume of a rectangle'' and ``open rectangle'' as given predicates/functions, so that the equality of the two definitions can be stated without developing the full machinery here. -/

variable {n : ℕ}

-- Notation for R^n
def Rn := Fin n → ℝ

-- Abstract definitions left as parameters: volume of a rectangle and the predicate for open rectangles
variable (V : Set Rn → Ennreal)
variable (is_open_rectangle : Set Rn → Prop)

/-- Two versions of the outer measure described in the statement; here they are left abstract. -/
variable (m_star mu_star : (Set Rn) → Ennreal)

/-- The translated theorem: for every S ⊆ R^n, the two definitions coincide. -/
