  Translation of:
  "Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups.
   If n = p_1^{k_1} ... p_r^{k_r} is the prime power factorization of n,
   then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n is
   p(k_1) ... p(k_r), where p(k) denotes the number of partitions of k."

  This file provides a direct formal-style translation (statements only, proofs omitted).
  Several auxiliary notions (partition counting function, count of isomorphism classes)
  are left as placeholders; the intention is to mirror the mathematical statements and
  connect them to Mathlib's basic types (AddCommGroup, Fintype, ZMod, AddEquiv, Fin).

/-- Structure theorem (finite abelian groups are direct products of cyclic groups).

    Formulated for additive abelian groups: if G is a finite additive commutative group
    then there exists a finite family of positive integers a_i such that G is additively
    equivalent to the product (Π i, ZMod (a_i)). -/

/-- Counting statement: given a factorization n = ∏_{i=0}^{r-1} p_i^{k_i} with the p_i
    distinct primes, the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n
    equals the product over i of partition_count(k_i).

    This is stated here using placeholders for the prime-indexed data and for the
    function iso_classes_count which would compute the desired cardinality. -/
