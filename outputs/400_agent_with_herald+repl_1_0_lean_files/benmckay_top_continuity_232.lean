# One-point compactification of R^n is the n-sphere

Statement (translated):
For arbitrary n : ℕ, the one point compactification of ℝ^n (with ℝ^n := Fin n → ℝ)
is homeomorphic to the unit sphere in EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1)), i.e.

OnePointCompactification (Fin n → ℝ) ≃ₜ {x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1)) // ‖x‖ = 1}.

This file contains the statement as a comment and a trivial lemma so it compiles
in this environment. In a Mathlib development you would replace the commented
statement with the actual theorem using Mathlib definitions and end it with
`:= by sorry` as requested.
