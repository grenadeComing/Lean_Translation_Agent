Take a path connected and locally simply connected space X, a group Γ, and a group morphism
φ : π1(X) → Γ. Suppose that Γ acts on a space X_φ. Then p_φ : X_φ → X is a Γ-covering space with
Γ ≅ π1(X), and any connected Γ-covering space Y → X comes from this construction with some
group morphism φ : π1(X) → Γ.
