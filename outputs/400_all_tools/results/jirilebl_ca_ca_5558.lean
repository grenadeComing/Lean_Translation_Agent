/-- The Schwarz lemma: Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic near 0 (DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0), maps the unit disk into itself (Set.MapsTo f (ball (0:ℂ) 1) (ball (0:ℂ) 1)), and f 0 = 0. Then the derivative at 0 has norm ≤ 1. State this in Lean4, import Mathlib at the top and end the theorem with := by sorry. -/
