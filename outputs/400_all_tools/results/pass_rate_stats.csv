1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load the Mathlib library (standard).
- `open Function`: Open the `Function` namespace; not used, but harmless.
- Docstring: `/-- Let R be a ring and let a ∈ R. Show that (-1) a = -a. -/` matches the natural language statement.
- `theorem neg_one_mul_ext (R : Type u) [Ring R] (a : R) : (-1) * a = -a := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type `R` equipped with a ring structure, and any element `a : R`, we have `(-1) * a = -a`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The Lean statement universally quantifies over any ring `R` and element `a : R`, asserting exactly the equality `(-1) * a = -a`. This matches the original: ""Let R be a ring and let a ∈ R. Show that (-1)a = -a.""
- The use of `*` for multiplication and unary minus for additive inverse is standard. The original implicit multiplication `(-1)a` is expressed as `(-1) * a`.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it's a single theorem statement with an unprovided proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same mathematical statement. No generalization/specialization discrepancy (uses Ring exactly, not weaker/stronger structure). No extra hypotheses or conclusions.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- Comment describes the theorem: exactly the natural language statement.
- `theorem modEq_iff_mod_eq_int {a b n : ℤ} (hn : 0 < n) : a ≡ b [ZMOD n] ↔ a % n = b % n := by sorry`
  • Variables `a b n : ℤ`: a, b, n are integers.
  • Hypothesis `hn : 0 < n`: n is a positive integer.
  • Statement `a ≡ b [ZMOD n] ↔ a % n = b % n`: “a is congruent to b modulo n” if and only if the (Euclidean) remainders of a and b upon division by n are equal. Here `%` is Int.mod, and with `0 < n` it represents the standard remainder in [0, n-1]. The notation `[ZMOD n]` is the standard Mathlib notation for congruence modulo the integer n.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement matches the natural language precisely: it assumes n > 0 (integer), a, b are integers, and asserts the equivalence between congruence modulo n and equality of remainders upon division by n. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same mathematically. The Lean formulation uses standard Mathlib notions (Int.ModEq via `≡ [ZMOD n]` and `%` for remainder) and the positivity assumption ensures the usual notion of remainder. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, giving access to standard definitions like integer congruence.
- Docstring: States exactly the natural language proposition: for a fixed positive integer n and integers a, b, c, if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n).
- `theorem trans_ext {n a b c : ℤ} (h1 : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) (h2 : b ≡ c [ZMOD n]) : a ≡ c [ZMOD n] := by sorry`:
  • Declares n, a, b, c as integers.
  • Hypotheses: `h1` is the congruence a ≡ b modulo n; `h2` is b ≡ c modulo n.
  • Conclusion: a ≡ c modulo n.
  • The notation `[ZMOD n]` denotes integer congruence modulo n (Int.ModEq n a b).

2) Whole translation check:
The Lean statement asserts the transitivity of integer congruence modulo n, exactly matching the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The natural language assumes n is a fixed positive integer. The Lean version allows any integer n (possibly 0 or negative). This is a slight generalization; the statement remains true for all integers n (since Int.ModEq is defined by divisibility n ∣ (a - b)). No vacuous definitions are introduced, and the theorem statement reflects the intended property. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The docstring restates the natural language statement: given integers a, b, c, d and a fixed integer n, with a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), show ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- `theorem mul_modEq_mul {a b c d n : ℤ} (h1 : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) (h2 : c ≡ d [ZMOD n]) : a * c ≡ b * d [ZMOD n] := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem over integers a, b, c, d, n, assuming `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, and concludes `a*c ≡ b*d (mod n)`. The `[ZMOD n]` notation is Mathlib’s standard for congruence modulo an integer n. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c, d ∈ ℤ. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- Lean theorem states exactly that congruence implication for integers, with modulus n.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only discrepancy: the natural language requires n > 0, while the Lean code allows any integer n (including 0 or negative). This is a slight generalization; the result remains true for any integer modulus (mod 0 congruence is equality; negative modulus is equivalent to positive via divisibility). As per the guidelines, such a slight generalization is acceptable.
- No fake or placeholder definitions; the theorem is stated directly with standard Mathlib notation.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful (slightly more general) formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib; no mathematical content change.
- Docstring: Restates the natural language goal: For a ring R and a,b,c in R, show a(b−c) = ab − ac.
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_511_mul_sub {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry` translates to: For any type R equipped with a ring structure, and any elements a, b, c in R, we have a·(b − c) = a·b − a·c. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing translation.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the algebraic identity requested: distribution of multiplication over subtraction on the left in a ring. It quantifies over a ring R and elements a, b, c ∈ R. The expression a*(b - c) = a*b - a*c is precisely the same as a(b−c) = ab − ac.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Same. The only potential nuance is that Mathlib’s `Ring` includes a multiplicative identity, whereas the identity also holds in a rng (ring without 1). However, the natural language “ring” commonly includes 1, and in any case the presence of 1 is irrelevant to the statement. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. Hence the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: For integers n, a, b, c, d, if n divides (a − b) and n divides (c − d), then n divides (a + c − (b + d)). The comment explains that this is exactly restating congruences modulo n as divisibility.

2) Faithfulness to the original:
- Original statement: For a fixed positive integer n and integers a, b, c, d, if a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod n).
- In ℤ, a ≡ b (mod n) is equivalent to n ∣ (a − b). Likewise for c, d. The conclusion a + c ≡ b + d (mod n) is equivalent to n ∣ ((a + c) − (b + d)). Thus the lemma’s statement is exactly the same property, expressed via divisibility.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean code allows any integer n (possibly 0 or negative), whereas the natural language specifies n is a positive integer. The result still holds for any integer n (for n=0 it reduces to equality; for negative n it’s equivalent to the positive modulus), so this is a slight generalization, not a mismatch. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. Therefore the translation is faithful.

  In natural language: For any type R with a multiplication and a zero satisfying the MulZeroClass axioms, and any element a of R, we have a * 0 = 0. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The original statement asks to prove both equalities: a * 0 = 0 and 0 * a = 0, i.e., the chain equality a * 0 = 0 = 0 * a. 
- The Lean theorem only asserts a * 0 = 0. It does not include 0 * a = 0.
- The typeclass assumption is `[MulZeroClass R]` rather than ""ring"". This is a mild generalization (weaker assumptions) and would be acceptable if the content matched, but the missing second equality is a substantive omission.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean statement proves only half of the requested result. It does not assert `0 * a = 0`, nor the combined chain equality `a * 0 = 0 = 0 * a`.
- Additional minor difference: the code uses `[MulZeroClass R]` instead of `Ring R`. This is a generalization and would be fine if both equalities were included, but as-is the main mismatch is the missing `0 * a = 0`.

  Natural language: Let n be a natural number with 1 < n. Let a and b be elements of ZMod n (i.e., classes mod n). If a is a unit in ZMod n, then there exists x in ZMod n such that a * x = b in ZMod n.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: “Let n>1 be an integer. Prove that the linear congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) has a solution in Z_n whenever the class [a] in Z_n is a unit.”
- The Lean theorem captures exactly: given n>1, a,b in Z_n, if a is a unit, then there exists x in Z_n solving a*x = b (which is the same as ax ≡ b mod n). The use of equality in ZMod n corresponds to congruence mod n on integers. The quantification over b is handled by taking b as an arbitrary parameter.

3) Final check and possible differences:
- The name includes “iff”, but the statement only gives the implication; this does not affect the content.
- The original says n is an integer > 1; the Lean code uses n : ℕ with 1 < n. This is a standard harmless specialization aligning with how ZMod is defined in Mathlib.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement defines a relation on ℝ by a ≈ b iff a − b ∈ ℤ, and asks to prove it is an equivalence relation. The Lean code defines exactly that relation (using the standard way to express “a − b is an integer” in Lean via ∃ z : ℤ, a − b = (z : ℝ)), and then states the theorem that this relation is an equivalence relation. This matches precisely.

3) Final check for differences:

- Relation definition: a − b ∈ ℤ versus ∃ z : ℤ, a − b = (z : ℝ). These are equivalent in Lean’s type-theoretic setting. Check.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- `example {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a b : R) : ... := by sorry`: States an example (a theorem without a provided proof) for an arbitrary type `R` with a ring structure, and elements `a b : R`.
- The proposition is `a * -b = -(a * b) ∧ (-a) * b = -(a * b)`: This asserts two equalities hold simultaneously in any ring: (1) `a * (-b) = -(a * b)` and (2) `(-a) * b = -(a * b)`.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural language statement is: For a ring R and elements a, b in R, show that `a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b`.
- This chain equality means two things: `a(-b) = -(ab)` and `-(ab) = (-a)b`.
- The Lean code explicitly states the first equality, and for the second it states the reverse, `(-a) * b = -(a * b)`. Since equality is symmetric, this is equivalent to `-(a*b) = (-a)*b`. Thus the Lean code captures exactly the two required equalities.
- No extra assumptions (like commutativity) are imposed: `[Ring R]` is appropriate.

Step 3: Final check for equivalence.
- The Lean statement is logically equivalent to the natural language statement. It presents both equalities comprising the chain, with one written in the reverse direction, which is fine. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the use of `sorry` only omits the proof and does not affect the statement. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  - Conclusion: there exists `r : ℕ` with `1 ≤ r` and `|G| = p^r`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If G is a finite group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime p, then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.""
- The code assumes G is a finite group and that every element has order a p-power of a fixed prime p. This matches the premise: `[Fintype G]`, `hp : Nat.Prime p`, and `h : ∀ g, ∃ k, orderOf g = p ^ k`.
- The conclusion exactly matches: `∃ r, 1 ≤ r ∧ Fintype.card G = p ^ r`.
- The code includes an extra assumption `[Nontrivial G]`. This aligns with the natural language conclusion requiring `r ≥ 1`. Without nontriviality, the trivial group would give `|G| = 1 = p^0`, contradicting `r ≥ 1`. So the Lean statement is a faithful formalization consistent with the intended (nontrivial) interpretation of the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib concepts are used, and the theorem is stated (proof omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable per instructions).

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes, modulo the explicit nontriviality assumption that is already implicit in the natural language by requiring `r ≥ 1`. The code faithfully captures the intended statement: finite group, fixed prime p, all elements have order a power of p, conclusion that the group order is p^r with r ≥ 1. No other discrepancies.

The natural language claim is: ""Let n be a positive integer. Then Z_n is a field if and only if n is a prime number."" The Lean statement matches this exactly in mathematical content, except it allows n = 0 as well (since n : ℕ without a positivity assumption). This is a slight generalization, but the equivalence still holds for n = 0: ZMod 0 ≅ ℤ is not a field and 0 is not prime, so both sides are false and the equivalence remains valid. Thus, the code captures the intended theorem and even slightly generalizes it legitimately.

3) Final check:
- Concepts used are standard Mathlib ones: `ZMod n`, `IsField`, `Nat.Prime`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only difference is the omission of the ""positive"" qualifier on n; this is a harmless and correct generalization. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- theorem srdoty_mul_zero (a : R) : a * 0 = 0: For all a in R, a·0 = 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Item 1 in NL: a·0 = 0 = 0·a. The Lean code splits this into two theorems a·0 = 0 and 0·a = 0, which together imply the chained equality; this is faithful.
- Item 2 in NL: a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b. The Lean code gives the two equalities a(−b) = −(ab) and (−a)b = −(ab), which jointly imply the chain; this is faithful.
- Item 3: (−a)(−b) = ab. Exactly matched.
- Item 4: a(b − c) = ab − ac. Exactly matched.
- Item 5: (−1)a = −a. Exactly matched.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with sorry proofs (allowed as per instructions). The only stylistic difference is splitting chained equalities into separate theorems, which preserves the mathematical content. No domain mismatch: works for any ring R and elements a, b, c ∈ R, as in the natural statement. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem center_perm_eq_bot {n : ℕ} (hn : 3 ≤ n) : Subgroup.center (Perm (Fin n)) = ⊥ := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem with hypothesis `hn : 3 ≤ n` and conclusion `Subgroup.center (Perm (Fin n)) = ⊥`.
  • `Perm (Fin n)` is the symmetric group on n letters (permutations of an n-element type).
  • `Subgroup.center G` is the center of a group `G` as a subgroup.
  • `⊥` is the trivial subgroup.
  Therefore the statement says: If n ≥ 3, then the center of the symmetric group on n letters is the trivial subgroup.

Whole translation vs original:
- Original: “Let n ≥ 3. Prove that the center Z(Sym_n) of the symmetric group on n letters is trivial.”
- Lean: With hypothesis `3 ≤ n`, prove `Subgroup.center (Perm (Fin n)) = ⊥`.
These are the same: `Perm (Fin n)` = Sym_n, `Subgroup.center` = Z(Sym_n), and equality to `⊥` exactly means the center is trivial.

Checks and discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem is exactly the desired statement, with the correct hypothesis and conclusion.
- Using `sorry` for the proof is acceptable per the auditing task (we only assess the statement).
There are no differences in meaning or scope.

- `theorem subgroups_int_eq_zmultiples : ∀ H : AddSubgroup ℤ, ∃ n : ℕ, H = AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every additive subgroup H of the integers, there exists a natural number n such that H equals the subgroup of integer multiples of n, i.e., H = nℤ. Here `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` denotes the subgroup { k * n | k ∈ ℤ } of ℤ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: subgroups of (Z, +) are exactly the subgroups nZ for integers n. The Lean statement asserts that every subgroup H is equal to nℤ for some n (here taken in ℕ and cast to ℤ). This captures the essential classification.
- The converse direction (that each nℤ is a subgroup) is built-in by the constructor `AddSubgroup.zmultiples`, so it need not be separately stated.
- Using n ∈ ℕ instead of n ∈ ℤ is a standard normalization since nℤ = (−n)ℤ, so this is an equivalent formulation and not a substantive restriction.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same content: Both assert that every subgroup of ℤ is of the form nℤ. The Lean version uses ℕ to avoid sign ambiguity; this is equivalent to the natural language statement allowing integer n. No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced, and the terminology is standard Mathlib (`AddSubgroup.zmultiples`).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language classification.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the full Mathlib library.
- `open Set Function
open Pointwise` opens namespaces; not essential to the statement but harmless.
- The docstring states the intended theorem: for a commutative ring R, R is a field iff every nonzero element is a unit, i.e., Rˣ = R \ {0}.
- `theorem isField_iff_forall_isUnit_ext (R : Type*) [CommRing R] : IsField R ↔ (range (Units.coeHom R) = { x : R | x ≠ 0 }) := by sorry`
  • This asserts: for a type R with a commutative ring structure, `IsField R` is equivalent to `range (Units.coeHom R) = {x : R | x ≠ 0}`.
  • Here, `Units.coeHom R : Units R →* R` is the canonical monoid hom sending a unit to its underlying element in R; as a function, its set-theoretic range is exactly the subset of R consisting of units. Thus `range (Units.coeHom R)` is `{x : R | IsUnit x}`.
  • `{x : R | x ≠ 0}` is the set of nonzero elements of R, i.e., `R \ {0}`.

2) Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement is: a commutative ring R is a field iff R× = R \ {0}.
- In Lean, since `R×` (the type `Units R`) is not literally a subset of `R`, the faithful formalization is to compare the image of `Units R` in `R`, i.e., `range (Units.coeHom R)`, with the set of nonzero elements `{x | x ≠ 0}`. This is exactly what the theorem states.
- Thus, the code captures precisely the intended equivalence: every nonzero element is a unit and conversely, which matches the field characterization.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematics match: both assert `IsField R` if and only if the units of R, viewed as elements of R, coincide with the nonzero elements. The minor formal nuance (using `range (Units.coeHom R)` instead of writing `R×`) is the standard way to reconcile type/set differences in Lean and is faithful to the natural statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; no red flags. The only omission is the proof (replaced by `sorry`), which is allowed per instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The hypothesis [NeZero n] matches “n a positive integer.” In ℕ, n > 0 is equivalent to n ≠ 0.
- Left-hand set: {x : ZMod n | IsUnit x} is the set of units in ℤ_n; this matches ℤ_n^×.
- Right-hand set: {x : ZMod n | Nat.gcd x.val n = 1} encodes the property gcd(a, n) = 1 using the canonical representative x.val ∈ {0, ..., n−1}. This is equivalent to gcd(a, n) = 1 for any integer representative a of x, so it matches the intended property.
- There are no auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement is given. The use of x.val is a standard way in mathlib to refer to the canonical representative in ZMod when n ≠ 0.

  Natural language: Given natural numbers m and n with m ≠ 0 and n ≠ 0 (hence m, n ≥ 1) and gcd(m, n) = 1, we define a (noncomputable) equivalence of types between ZMod m × ZMod n and ZMod (m * n). No proof is provided (`sorry`).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The mathematical content of the natural language statement is an isomorphism of the finite cyclic groups (or rings) Z_m × Z_n and Z_{mn} when gcd(m, n) = 1. In Mathlib, this should be stated as a ring isomorphism (`ZMod (m*n) ≃+* ZMod m × ZMod n`) or at least an additive group isomorphism (`ZMod m × ZMod n ≃+ ZMod (m*n)`).
- The code, however, only asserts a bare type equivalence (`Equiv`), which is a bijection of underlying sets without any requirement to respect addition or multiplication. This is strictly weaker and misses the algebraic structure central to the statement. Moreover, as sets, `ZMod m × ZMod n` and `ZMod (m*n)` both have cardinality m*n (for m, n ≠ 0), so such an `Equiv` exists regardless of gcd(m, n) = 1. Thus the gcd hypothesis becomes superfluous at the level of `Equiv`.
- The use of `ℕ` with `[NeZero m] [NeZero n]` aligns with “integers ≥ 1”, and using `ZMod` matches the intended objects. The direction of the equivalence is immaterial. The presence of `sorry` affects proof, not statement; the task is about translation of the statement type.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: an isomorphism of cyclic groups/rings (structure-preserving) under the coprime condition.
- Code: a mere bijection of underlying sets under the coprime condition (unnecessarily strong hypothesis for the claimed conclusion).
They are different in a crucial way: the code’s statement is too weak and does not capture the algebraic isomorphism claim. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Cardinal`: bring Mathlib into scope; Cardinal is not used later.
- The theorem statement:
  - Inputs: `G` is a type with a `Group` structure and `Fintype` (so G is a finite group). `p : ℕ` with `hp : Nat.Prime p` and `hp' : p ≠ 2` (so p is an odd prime). `hG : Fintype.card G = 2 * p` (|G| = 2p).
  - Conclusion: `(Nonempty (G ≃* ZMod (2 * p))) ∨ Nonempty (G ≃* DihedralGroup p)`.
  - Interpreted: Either there exists a group isomorphism from G to `ZMod (2*p)` or there exists a group isomorphism from G to `DihedralGroup p`.

Faithfulness check against the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: If |G| = 2p with p an odd prime, then G ≅ Z_{2p} or D_p.
- The dihedral side is faithful: `DihedralGroup p` is the standard dihedral group of order 2p in Mathlib.
- The cyclic side is not faithful as written: `Z_{2p}` denotes the cyclic group of order 2p, which in Mathlib is modeled by the additive group of `ZMod (2 * p)`. The code uses `G ≃* ZMod (2 * p)`, i.e., a multiplicative group isomorphism to `ZMod (2*p)` viewed as a multiplicative group. But `ZMod n`’s canonical group structure is additive, not multiplicative. As a multiplicative structure, `ZMod n` is a ring and its multiplicative monoid is not a group when n > 2 (and in general does not even have a `Group` instance). The correct formal target for “Z_{2p}” would be either `G ≃+ ZMod (2 * p)` (if G were written additively) or `G ≃* Additive (ZMod (2 * p))` to view the additive group of `ZMod` as a multiplicative group. Therefore, the current statement does not faithfully encode “G is cyclic of order 2p.”
- The hypotheses correctly encode “p is an odd prime” via `Nat.Prime p` and `p ≠ 2`, and `Fintype.card G = 2 * p` matches |G| = 2p.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; the only issue is the incorrect use of `ZMod` in the target.

Final comparison:
- The dihedral alternative matches.
- The cyclic alternative is incorrectly expressed (wrong group structure on `ZMod`). Hence the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale:
- Aside from the incorrect group structure on `ZMod`, everything else aligns well, and fixing it to `Additive (ZMod (2*p))` (or changing to an additive isomorphism) would make it faithful. This is a significant but isolated issue, so the translation is “almost the same but not faithful.”

  Natural language: For each natural number n, we (purport to) define a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes of the symmetric group on n letters (implemented as the quotient of Perm (Fin n) by the conjugacy setoid) and the set of multisets of positive natural numbers whose sum is n (a standard model of integer partitions of n). The term is filled by sorry, so no actual construction is given.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The natural language statement: Two permutations in S_n are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type; hence partitions of n label conjugacy classes of S_n; the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of partitions of n.
- The Lean statement proposes an explicit equivalence between the quotient by conjugacy and the subtype of multisets of positive integers summing to n. This exactly formalizes “conjugacy classes are in bijection with partitions of n.” From such an equivalence, it follows that two permutations are conjugate iff they have the same partition (cycle type), and the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of partitions. Using Multiset ℕ with the predicate a ≠ 0 for elements faithfully models partitions as multisets of positive integers; 1-cycles (fixed points) are allowed because 1 ≠ 0.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Mathematically, the statement being asserted is faithful to the original: it gives a bijection between conjugacy classes in S_n and integer partitions of n. This formulation even encapsulates both the classification and the counting result.
- Minor technical choices (Perm (Fin n) for S_n, quotients by IsConj, partitions as multisets of positive integers) are standard and faithful.
- However, the provided Lean definition uses ‘by sorry’, making the equivalence a vacuous placeholder rather than a legitimate construction. Per the guidelines, such a vacuous term means the translation fails despite the statement being correct in spirit.

Conclusion: The intended statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim, but the use of ‘sorry’ renders the code vacuous, so it does not pass the audit.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem is stated for a natural number n with hypothesis hn : 6 ≤ n.
- N is a Subgroup of Equiv.Perm (Fin n), i.e., a subgroup of the full symmetric group S_n on Fin n.
- hN_sub : N ≤ alternatingGroup (Fin n) asserts that N is contained in A_n (so N is a subgroup of A_n, albeit typed as a subgroup of S_n).
- hN_normal : ∀ g, g ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) → ∀ x, x ∈ N → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N states that for all g ∈ A_n and all x ∈ N, the conjugate g x g⁻¹ lies in N. Together with hN_sub, this is exactly “N is normal in A_n”.
- hN_proper : N ≠ alternatingGroup (Fin n) asserts that N is a proper subset of A_n; combined with hN_sub, this means “N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n”.
- The conclusion: ∀ i : Fin n, ∀ σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), σ ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) → σ i = i → σ ∈ N says: for every i and every even permutation σ that fixes i, σ belongs to N. Equivalently, for each i, the set Gi = {σ ∈ A_n | σ i = i} is contained in N.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: For n ≥ 6, if N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n, then N contains every subgroup Gi = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i} for each i. The code’s conclusion “∀ i, ∀ σ ∈ A_n, σ i = i → σ ∈ N” matches exactly that Gi ⊆ N for each i. The premises encode that N ≤ A_n, N is normal in A_n, and N ≠ A_n, which is precisely “proper normal subgroup of A_n”. Using N as a subgroup of S_n with N ≤ A_n is a standard formalization choice and is mathematically equivalent in this context.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The ambient type and group (Equiv.Perm (Fin n) and alternatingGroup (Fin n)) are correct.
- Normality is expressed correctly relative to A_n.
- Properness is correctly expressed via inequality N ≠ A_n, with inclusion N ≤ A_n given.
- The conclusion is exactly Gi ⊆ N for each i.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms come from Mathlib. There are no mismatches or unintended generalizations/restrictions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: imports Mathlib.
- `variable (iso_classes_of_order : ℕ → Type)`: introduces an arbitrary family of types indexed by n, purportedly representing “isomorphism classes of order n,” but with no connection to groups or abelian groups.
- `variable (partitions : ℕ → ℕ)`: introduces an arbitrary function from ℕ to ℕ, presumably intended to be the partition function p(k), but not enforced.
- `variable (iso_classes_fintype : ∀ n, Fintype (iso_classes_of_order n))`: asserts each `iso_classes_of_order n` is a finite type so that one can take `Fintype.card`.
- `theorem finite_abelian_groups_count (n : ℕ) (ps ks : List ℕ) (h : ps.length = ks.length ∧ (∀ p ∈ ps, Nat.Prime p) ∧ n = List.prod (List.map (fun x => x.fst ^ x.snd) (List.zip ps ks))) : Fintype.card (iso_classes_of_order n) = List.prod (List.map partitions ks) := by sorry`
  This states: for any natural number n and lists ps, ks of equal length with ps consisting of primes and n equal to the product over zipped pairs (p^k), the cardinality of the arbitrary type `iso_classes_of_order n` equals the product over `partitions k` for k in ks. There is no link to groups, abelian groups, or classification.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language has two parts:
  (A) Structure theorem: Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups.
  (B) Counting isomorphism classes: If n = p1^{k1} ... pr^{kr} is the prime power factorization, then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n equals p(k1)...p(kr), where p(k) is the partition function.
- The Lean theorem addresses only a counting equality and even that is entirely abstracted away via placeholder variables `iso_classes_of_order` and `partitions` with no semantics tying them to finite abelian groups or the partition function. It does not include the structural statement (A) at all.
- Moreover, even for (B), the hypotheses on ps and ks are too weak and not canonical: it allows repeated primes in `ps`, allows exponents in `ks` to be zero, and does not enforce that `ps` lists distinct primes or that the factorization is the prime power factorization of n. The original statement presumes the distinct-prime factorization with ki ≥ 1.
- There is no use of Mathlib’s group structures (no `Group`, `Abelian`, `Fintype`, `IsCyclic`, direct products, etc.), nor any reference to standard Mathlib definitions of isomorphism classes of groups or partitions.
- The auxiliary “definitions” (`iso_classes_of_order`, `partitions`) are entirely vacuous placeholders, not legitimate Mathlib concepts; they sever the statement from the intended mathematical content.

3) Final comparison:
- The code does not formalize the structure theorem at all.
- The counting statement is presented with vacuous placeholders and too-weak/incorrect hypotheses on the factorization, and thus is not a faithful formalization of the intended classification result.
- Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Given these discrepancies (vacuous placeholders, missing the first statement entirely, and an imprecise encoding of the prime power factorization), this does not pass.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library.
- Docstring: States the intended meaning: for a prime p and a finite abelian p-group G, if G is simple (i.e., a composition factor), then G ≅ ZMod p (as a multiplicative group). This is the usual classification that a nontrivial simple abelian p-group has order p.
- Theorem statement:
  - Parameters: `p : ℕ` with `hp : p.Prime`.
  - `G : Type*` with `[Group G] [Finite G] [CommGroup G]`: G is a finite abelian group.
  - `hP : IsPGroup p G`: G is a p-group.
  - `hsimple : IsSimpleGroup G`: G is simple (and thus nontrivial).
  - Conclusion: `Nonempty (MulEquiv G (Multiplicative (ZMod p)))`: there exists a group isomorphism between G and the multiplicative version of ZMod p (i.e., the additive cyclic group of order p viewed multiplicatively).
  - `by sorry`: proof omitted; this is acceptable for our auditing purposes as long as the statement is faithful.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement says: ""Let p be a prime. Show that the composition factors of any finite abelian p-group are all isomorphic to Z_p."" A composition factor is, by definition, a simple quotient appearing in a composition series; in a finite abelian p-group, any composition factor is a simple, finite, abelian p-group. The Lean theorem exactly asserts: any simple, finite, abelian p-group (for a given prime p) is isomorphic to ZMod p. This is precisely the per-factor claim needed to conclude that every composition factor is Z_p. Thus the theorem captures the core content of the original statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Original: universal claim about all composition factors of any finite abelian p-group being Z_p.
- Lean: for any simple finite abelian p-group, the group is isomorphic to ZMod p.
These are equivalent in content for composition factors because composition factors satisfy the Lean theorem’s hypotheses. The slight difference in framing (talking directly about simple groups rather than composition factors) is standard and faithful. Technical choices (using `Multiplicative (ZMod p)` to match multiplicative group structure) are standard and do not change the meaning.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all used notions (`IsPGroup`, `IsSimpleGroup`, `Finite`, `CommGroup`, `ZMod`) are Mathlib concepts. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Use mathlib.
- The theorem `center_card_prime_pow` has parameters `p r : ℕ`, `hp : Nat.Prime p`, a type `G` with `[Group G] [Fintype G]`, and also `[Fintype (Subgroup.center G)]`. It assumes `hG : Fintype.card G = p ^ r`.
- Conclusion: `∃ k : ℕ, 1 ≤ k ∧ Fintype.card (Subgroup.center G) = p ^ k`.

In words: For a finite group G of order p^r with p prime, the center has cardinality p^k for some k ≥ 1.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let G be a group of order p^r with p prime and r ≥ 1. Then |Z(G)| = p^k for some integer k ≥ 1.
- Lean: Assumes p is prime and |G| = p^r, but does not assume r ≥ 1. It concludes existence of k with 1 ≤ k and |Z(G)| = p^k.

Step 3: Are they the same?
- The key discrepancy: the Lean statement omits the hypothesis r ≥ 1.
- This omission matters: if r = 0, then |G| = 1 and |Z(G)| = 1 = p^0, so the correct exponent is k = 0, contradicting the stated `1 ≤ k`. Thus the Lean statement is strictly stronger (and false) when r = 0.
- All other aspects match: p prime, group order p^r, center cardinality expressed as p^k with k ≥ 1. The extra typeclass `[Fintype (Subgroup.center G)]` is benign/redundant (derivable from `[Fintype G]`) and not a vacuous placeholder.

Conclusion: The translation is almost correct but misses the crucial r ≥ 1 hypothesis, changing the meaning. Therefore it is not a faithful translation.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens are standard Mathlib setup; no custom/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem is named `isCyclic_units_zmod_iff` and states: for a natural number n with 2 ≤ n, the group of units of ZMod n (i.e., (ZMod n)ˣ) is cyclic if and only if n = 2 or n = 4 or there exist natural numbers p and t such that p is prime, p ≠ 2 (so p is odd), t > 0, and n = p^t or n = 2 * p^t.
- The statement uses `IsCyclic (ZMod n)ˣ`, which is precisely the property that the multiplicative group of units modulo n is cyclic.
- The right-hand side encodes exactly the classification: n equals 2, 4, an odd prime power p^t with t > 0, or twice such a prime power 2*p^t.
- The hypothesis `hn : 2 ≤ n` intentionally excludes n = 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: “There is a primitive root in the multiplicative group Z_n^× iff n = 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t, where p is an odd prime.”
- In group-theoretic terms, “there is a primitive root in Z_n^×” means the multiplicative group of units modulo n is cyclic (i.e., has a generator). Thus, it matches `IsCyclic (ZMod n)ˣ`.
- The classification given matches exactly: the code requires either n = 2, n = 4, or n is an odd prime power p^t with t > 0, or twice an odd prime power. The condition `p ≠ 2` encodes “p odd,” and `t > 0` enforces a positive exponent.
- The natural language statement does not mention n = 1, and the code similarly restricts to n ≥ 2, so there is no mismatch here; this is a standard convention for this theorem.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly encodes the intended content.
- The Lean formalization uses the standard equivalence: “primitive root exists” ↔ “units group is cyclic.” This is mathematically faithful.
- The small technical detail `2 ≤ n` aligns with the omission of n = 1 in the natural language.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- to_matrix (a b : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ... defines the 2×2 real matrix [[a, -b], [b, a]]. Indexing is via Fin 2 with entries at (0,0)=a, (0,1)=-b, (1,0)=b, (1,1)=a.
- G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { M | ∃ a b : ℝ, M = to_matrix a b } defines G as the set of exactly those matrices of the above form. This matches the natural language definition.
- G_add_closed, G_neg_closed, G_zero_mem are stated as theorems (with proofs omitted by sorry) asserting: if M,N ∈ G then M+N ∈ G; if M ∈ G then −M ∈ G; and 0 ∈ G. These are the standard closure properties showing that G is an additive subgroup (hence a group under matrix addition, since associativity and commutativity are inherited from matrix addition on all matrices).
- phi (z : ℂ) := to_matrix z.re z.im is the obvious map ℂ → matrices, sending a+bi ↦ [[a, −b],[b, a]]. This targets the ambient matrix type (not the subtype), but is conceptually the intended embedding.
- complex_equiv_G : AddEquiv ℂ (Subtype G) defines an additive equivalence (i.e., an additive group isomorphism) between ℂ and the subtype of matrices lying in G. The toFun sends z to its associated matrix together with the proof it lies in G; the invFun extracts the real and imaginary parts from the matrix entries (M 0 0 and M 1 0). The fields left_inv, right_inv, and map_add are marked sorry, but they are the correct properties to verify to establish the isomorphism.

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
- The code faithfully defines the set G as in the problem.
- It states the necessary closure properties to show G is a group under addition (zero, additive closure, and additive inverses); associativity and commutativity come from the ambient matrix addition, so the intent matches the claim that G is a group under matrix addition.
- It constructs the standard isomorphism (ℂ, +) ≅ G by packaging the map z ↦ [[Re z, −Im z], [Im z, Re z]] into an AddEquiv with the obvious inverse. This exactly matches the required isomorphism.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not explicitly bundle G as an AddSubgroup or give an instance [AddGroup (Subtype G)], but it provides the closure lemmas that would be used to do so and then directly defines an AddEquiv to (Subtype G). This is a mild formalization choice and does not change the mathematical content of the statement.
- Proofs are omitted via sorry, which is acceptable under the instruction ""No proofs are used""; there are no vacuous or fake definitions (no placeholders like True/none). The constructions themselves are the standard ones.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only minor formalization differences (not bundling an AddSubgroup structure explicitly), and gives the correct isomorphism as an AddEquiv.

- `by sorry`: Proof omitted, which is acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For finite subgroups H, K of a group G with |H| = m and |K| = n, if gcd(m, n) = 1, then H ∩ K = {1}.
- Lean: For finite subgroups H, K of G with coprime cardinalities, conclude H ⊓ K = ⊥.
- In Lean, `H ⊓ K` denotes the subgroup intersection, and `⊥` denotes the trivial subgroup `{1}`. Using `Fintype.card` corresponds to |H| and |K|. Requiring finiteness via `[Fintype ↥H] [Fintype ↥K]` matches the hypothesis that H and K are finite. The coprime hypothesis `Nat.Coprime` is exactly `gcd(m, n) = 1`.
- Therefore, the theorem statement exactly matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement uses the lattice notation `⊓` and `⊥` instead of set notation `∩` and `{1}`; these are standard equivalents for subgroup intersection and the trivial subgroup. 
- The natural language names the orders m and n explicitly, while Lean directly uses `Fintype.card` without naming them. This is purely notational and not a mathematical difference.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The code compiles in the sense of declarations; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is permitted for this audit.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the given natural language statement.

2) Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: ""Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ of integers. Any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ_n of integers modulo n, for some positive integer n.""
- The Lean statements exactly capture this, in the additive-group setting: they assume cyclicity explicitly via `hg` (existence of a generator g such that every element is an integer multiple of g), and then conclude existence of an additive isomorphism to ℤ in the infinite case and to ZMod n with n > 0 in the finite case. The use of `Nonempty (G ≃+ Int)` and `Nonempty (G ≃+ ZMod n)` is the formal way to state existence of a group isomorphism. The finite case quantifies over some n with `0 < n`, matching the ""for some positive integer n"" phrasing.
- The choice to present groups additively is consistent with the target groups ℤ and ℤ_n, which are customarily written additively. The requirement of `Infinite G` in the first theorem and `[Fintype G]` in the second properly distinguishes the infinite and finite cyclic cases.
- The generator `g` is chosen as a parameter with the hypothesis that it generates (rather than quantifying `∃ g`), which is a standard and logically equivalent way to formalize “G is cyclic”.

3) Final check: Are the math problems the same?
- Yes. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary fake definitions are introduced. The theorems faithfully state exactly the intended results for cyclic additive groups, distinguishing the infinite and finite cases and matching the isomorphism targets ℤ and ZMod n (with n > 0).

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {F : Type _} [Field F]`: Let F be a field.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: Let n be a finite index type with decidable equality (this is the mathlib way to model n×n matrices; it slightly generalizes the usual n ∈ ℕ case by allowing any finite type of size n).
- `def H_set (G : Subgroup (GL n F)) : Set (GL n F) := ...`: Given a subgroup G of GL(n, F), define H_set G to be the subset of GL(n, F) consisting of those A such that A ∈ G and det(A) = 1 or det(A) = -1. Here det(A) is computed by viewing A as a matrix `A : Matrix n n F`.
- `theorem H_is_subgroup (G : Subgroup (GL n F)) : ∃ H : Subgroup (GL n F), (H : Set (GL n F)) = H_set G := ...`: For any subgroup G of GL(n, F), there exists a subgroup H of GL(n, F) whose underlying set equals H_set G. In other words, the set of elements of G with determinant ±1 is closed under the group operations, hence forms a subgroup (of GL(n, F)) and is contained in G.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement defines H = {A ∈ G : det A = ±1} and asks to prove that H is a subgroup of G. The Lean code defines the corresponding set H_set G and asserts the existence of a subgroup H of GL(n, F) whose carrier equals H_set G. This exactly formalizes that H_set G is a subgroup (of the ambient GL(n, F)); since its carrier requires membership in G, it is in particular a subgroup of GL(n, F) contained in G, i.e., “a subgroup of G” in the usual mathematical sense. The code’s use of a finite index type n (instead of a natural number) is a standard, slightly more general formulation in mathlib and is acceptable.

Step 3: Final comparison for differences.
- Ambient group and subgroup relationship: The code establishes H as a Subgroup (GL n F) whose elements are precisely those in G with determinant ±1. This implies H ≤ G. That matches “H is a subgroup of G”.
- Definition of ±1: Implemented as det = 1 ∨ det = -1, which is faithful, even in characteristic 2 where -1 = 1.
- Slight generalization of n: Using any finite type instead of ℕ, which is harmless and standard.
- No vacuous placeholders: H_set is a genuine definition; the theorem statement is the correct goal. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed per the instructions as long as the statement is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- inductive RowOp (R) (n): defines the three kinds of row operations on n×n matrices over R:
  • swap i j: swap rows i and j.
  • scale i c: multiply row i by scalar c.
  • add i j c: replace row i by row i + c · row j.
- apply_row_op [Semiring R] op A: applies the specified row operation to matrix A by defining the resulting matrix entrywise:
  • swap: row i becomes row j and row j becomes row i; other rows unchanged.
  • scale: row i is scaled by a.
  • add: row i is replaced by row i plus a times row j.
- elementary_matrix op: the matrix obtained by applying op to the identity matrix; i.e., the elementary matrix corresponding to op.
- mat_mul A B: the usual matrix product defined as (i,k) ↦ ∑_{j} A i j * B j k.
- theorem apply_row_op_eq_mat_mul: for any op and A, applying op to A equals left-multiplying A by the corresponding elementary matrix: apply_row_op op A = mat_mul (elementary_matrix op) A. Proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For any positive integer n, if A is n×n and B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, then B = U A where U is the corresponding elementary n×n elementary matrix of the same type.
- The Lean theorem expresses exactly that relationship: for any A and any single row operation op, the result of applying op to A equals the product of the elementary matrix for op with A. If one sets B := apply_row_op op A and U := elementary_matrix op, then the theorem states B = U · A. The definitions of apply_row_op and elementary_matrix are standard.

3) Differences and potential discrepancies:
- Scaling by zero: The inductive constructor scale allows any c : R, not requiring c ≠ 0. In many texts, elementary row operations restrict scaling to nonzero scalars. The Lean code thus slightly generalizes the class of operations. The stated equality still holds in this more general setting; however, for c = 0, the operation is not an elementary operation in the usual sense and the resulting matrix is not invertible.
- Swap with i = j is allowed (a no-op). Typically, elementary operations are between distinct rows, but including the trivial case does not harm the statement; the equality remains true.
- n is Nat (possibly 0) rather than a positive integer. If n = 0 there are no indices, hence no op values; the theorem is still appropriately formulated (there are no instances to apply). This is a benign generalization.
- The product is written via a custom mat_mul rather than using the built-in Matrix.mul; it is definitionally the standard matrix product, so this is faithful.
- No vacuous placeholders: All auxiliary definitions are meaningful and model the intended concepts; there are no fake predicates or dummy definitions.

Conclusion: The code gives a faithful formalization of the statement, with minor generalizations (allowing zero scaling, possibly equal indices in swap, and n = 0). These do not undermine the essence of the claim that performing a single row operation corresponds to left multiplication by the associated elementary matrix.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Load Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- `universe u v`: Universe levels.
- `def SL (n : Type u) (R : Type v) [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n] [CommRing R] : Type _ := { A : Matrix n n R // A.det = 1 }`
  Natural language: Define SL(n, R) as the subtype of n×n matrices over R whose determinant equals 1. Here, n is an arbitrary finite index type (not necessarily {1, …, n}) and R is a commutative ring. This matches the intended set {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(R) : det A = 1}, but in greater generality (arbitrary commutative ring R and arbitrary finite index type n).
- `instance SL_group ... : Group (SL n R) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Assert that this subtype carries a group structure (implicitly under matrix multiplication). However, the group instance is provided with `by sorry`, i.e., no construction or proof; it’s a placeholder.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The definition of the set SL matches the intended set of matrices with determinant 1, though generalized from R = ℝ to any commutative ring R and from n ∈ ℕ to any finite type index n. This is a harmless and common generalization in mathlib.
- The natural language asks to show (i.e., prove) that SL(n) is a group under matrix multiplication. The Lean code attempts to provide a `Group` instance for `SL n R`, which would exactly formalize that claim, but the instance is filled with `sorry` and thus is vacuous. It does not actually define the group operation and axioms (closure, associativity inherited, identity, inverses) on the subtype—these are asserted without proof/content. By the auditing guidelines, this is a red flag and means the translation does not faithfully establish the statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - Generalization: The code uses any commutative ring R and any finite index type n instead of ℝ and an n×n matrix over ℕ-indexed dimension. This is acceptable as a slight generalization.
  - Crucial issue: The group structure is claimed via `by sorry`, i.e., not actually provided. Therefore, the code does not legitimately show that SL is a group under matrix multiplication. It fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions/theorems not be vacuous.

Conclusion: Despite a correct definition of the set and a reasonable generalization, the core claim (that it is a group under multiplication) is asserted without proof via `sorry`. Hence the translation is not faithful.

- import Mathlib: Brings in the Mathlib library, including matrices over ℝ and determinants.
- def row_swap (n) (i j) : Matrix ... ℝ := ...: Defines the n×n matrix over ℝ that swaps rows i and j when left-multiplying. Concretely, the matrix has 1 in positions (i, j) and (j, i), 1s on the diagonal for all r ≠ i, j, and 0 elsewhere (so it is the standard row-swap elementary matrix; if i = j it reduces to the identity).
- def row_scale (n) (i) (a) (ha : a ≠ 0) : Matrix ... ℝ := ...: Defines the elementary diagonal matrix which multiplies row i by a when left-multiplying. It is the identity except that the (i, i) entry is a.
- def row_add (n) (i j) (a) (h : i ≠ j) : Matrix ... ℝ := ...: Defines the elementary matrix that adds a times row j to row i when left-multiplying. This is the identity plus an a in the (i, j) entry; i ≠ j is required.
- inductive IsElementaryMatrix (n) : Matrix ... ℝ → Prop: A predicate indicating a matrix is elementary if it is exactly one of the three types: swap, scale (with nonzero a), or add (with i ≠ j), via the three constructors.
- theorem exists_list_of_det_ne_zero {n} (A) (h : A.det ≠ 0) : ∃ l : List (Matrix ...), (∀ B ∈ l, IsElementaryMatrix n B) ∧ (List.foldr (fun x y => x * y) 1 l) = A := by sorry: States that for any n×n real matrix A with nonzero determinant (nonsingular), there exists a finite list l of matrices, each an elementary matrix (as defined), whose product (taken as foldr with multiplication and identity, i.e., E1 * E2 * ... * Ek) equals A.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement says: Any nonsingular n×n real matrix A can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.
- The Lean theorem assumes A.det ≠ 0 (nonsingular over ℝ) and concludes the existence of a finite product of matrices, each declared elementary by the IsElementaryMatrix predicate matching standard elementary row matrices, whose product equals A. This matches exactly the natural language statement.
- The definitions of the three elementary matrices (row swap, row scaling by nonzero factor, and row addition with i ≠ j) are standard. Allowing, e.g., a = 1 or i = j results in identity being considered elementary via scale; this is a benign detail and consistent with many conventions. The presence of identity in the set of elementary matrices does not violate the statement.
- The product is represented via List.foldr with multiplication and identity, which corresponds to multiplying the listed elementary matrices to obtain A. Order conventions are implicit but irrelevant to existence.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous placeholders: all auxiliary definitions are concrete matrix definitions, not props like True. No use of sorry in definitions; only the theorem proof is omitted, which is allowed per instructions.
- Domain matches: real matrices, n×n, nonsingular ⇔ det ≠ 0. Conclusion matches: exists a finite product of elementary matrices equal to A.
- Slight technical generality (allowing n = 0) is standard and consistent with the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `def GLn (n : Nat) : Type := { A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real // Matrix.det A ≠ 0 }`: Define GLn(n, ℝ) as the subtype of n×n real matrices whose determinant is nonzero. This matches the set {A in Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A ≠ 0}.
- `instance (n : Nat) : Group (GLn n) := by sorry`: Declare that GLn(n) has a `Group` structure, but leave the entire construction and verification as `sorry`. In Lean, a `Group` instance includes providing the multiplication, identity, inverse, and proofs of the axioms. Using `sorry` here leaves all of that unspecified.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
The natural statement is: “Show that GL(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A ≠ 0} is a group under matrix multiplication.”
- The set/type is correctly defined.
- The group structure is only asserted to exist (via an instance) but not constructed. Crucially, the statement requires the group operation to be matrix multiplication restricted to the subtype, and inverses to be matrix inverses. The code does not actually specify that the multiplication in the instance coincides with matrix multiplication; because the entire instance is `sorry`, the multiplication and other fields are not given. Thus the code does not faithfully encode “under matrix multiplication,” it only asserts that there exists some group structure.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Natural language: GL(n) with the operation being matrix multiplication is a group.
- Lean: GLn is some group (operation and axioms left opaque by `sorry`). The intended comment suggests matrix multiplication, but the code does not enforce it. Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful formalization of “under matrix multiplication.” It is close (correct set, correct goal shape), but the core content tying the group operation to matrix multiplication is missing due to the `sorry` in the instance, which hides not only proofs but also the actual operations.

Given the guidelines, while the auxiliary definition GLn is legitimate, the final instance is effectively vacuous regarding the required operation. Hence, the translation is not fully faithful.

  Translating: For a natural number n with 2 ≤ n, there exists a permutation σ of Fin n such that the subgroup generated (closure) by the set containing the transposition swapping 0 and 1 and σ is the whole symmetric group on Fin n (i.e., top subgroup). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
  Important technical details:
  - `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is the symmetric group on n elements indexed 0,…,n−1 (standard formalization of Sym_n).
  - `Equiv.swap (Fin.mk 0 ...) (Fin.mk 1 ...)` is the transposition (0 1) on Fin n, with witnesses ensuring 0 < n and 1 < n derived from 2 ≤ n.
  - The set `{..., σ}` is a two-element set of permutations whose closure is asserted to be ⊤.
  - There is no predicate asserting that σ is an n-cycle; σ is arbitrary.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Original: “Let n ≥ 2. Prove that Sym_n is generated by the set S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,…,n)}.” This says the specific pair consisting of the transposition (1 2) and the explicit n-cycle (1 2 3 … n) generates the whole symmetric group.
- Lean: Asserts existence of some σ such that { (0 1), σ } generates Sym_n. It does not specify that σ is the specific cycle (0 1 2 … n−1), nor even that σ is any n-cycle at all. It is strictly weaker (existential vs asserting a specific generator) and misses the ""n-cycle"" property entirely, despite the comment.
- Indexing difference (1-based vs 0-based) is harmless and acceptable.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- Differences:
  - The original statement specifies the exact generating set S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,…,n)}; the Lean statement only claims there exists some σ (no condition) such that {(0,1), σ} generates.
  - The Lean code does not enforce that σ is an n-cycle, contrary to its comment.
- Conclusion: The Lean theorem is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement; it is a weaker and different claim.

Given there are no vacuous auxiliary definitions and the structure is close in spirit (generation of Sym_n by two elements including a transposition), but the core property (σ being the explicit n-cycle) is missing and the quantification is weaker (existential), the translation is not faithful.

- O_set (R) (n) := { A | IsUnit (Matrix.det A) ∧ A * Aᵀ = 1 }. Natural language: the orthogonal group (as a set of matrices) consists of matrices in GL(n, R) whose product with their transpose is the identity. This aligns with the standard definition O(n, R) = { A ∈ GL(n, R) | A Aᵀ = I }. The explicit IsUnit det condition is redundant but consistent since A Aᵀ = I already implies A is invertible.
- Theorem O_set_eq_GL_set: O_set R n = { A ∈ GL_set R n | A * Aᵀ = 1 }. This states exactly that the set defined as orthogonal matrices equals the subset of GL(n, R) consisting of matrices satisfying A Aᵀ = I. This is a direct restatement of the definition.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
The natural language claim is “Prove that O(n) = {A ∈ GL(n) : A A^T = I}.” The code defines the two sets and states their equality, matching the statement precisely. The parameter R is a field, which is a standard context (and a slight generalization from the usual R = ℝ), and transpose is well-defined for matrices over any field. This is faithful.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code uses a general field R rather than specifically ℝ; this is a harmless generalization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- GL(n) is encoded via IsUnit det, which is equivalent to invertibility over a field. No issue.
- No vacuous placeholders: both GL_set and O_set are legitimate definitions using Mathlib primitives. The theorem is a definitional equality. The presence of `sorry` in the proof is not relevant for translation fidelity per the task instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and open matrix notation.
- Docstring: states the intent to show that the orthogonal matrices O(n) form a group: the subtype of n×n real matrices satisfying A * Aᵀ = 1 carries a Group structure.
- `noncomputable def orthogonal_group (n : ℕ) : Group (Subtype fun A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ => A * Aᵀ = 1) := by sorry`
  This claims to define a concrete Group structure on the subtype {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ | A * Aᵀ = 1}. The idea is that the multiplication is inherited from matrix multiplication, the identity is the identity matrix (which is in the subtype), and the inverse is given by transpose, with group axioms holding by matrix algebra. However, the entire structure is left as `by sorry`, i.e., a placeholder that does not actually construct the group operations or prove the axioms.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Prove that O(n) = {A in Mat_{n×n}(ℝ): A Aᵀ = I} is a group under matrix multiplication, using the identities (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1} and (AB)ᵀ = Bᵀ Aᵀ.
- The Lean code aims to assert precisely that the subtype {A | A * Aᵀ = 1} has a Group structure. Using transpose as inverse aligns with the intended proof approach (since A Aᵀ = I implies Aᵀ = A^{-1}). The condition A Aᵀ = I is equivalent to Aᵀ A = I over ℝ for square matrices, so the chosen defining property is fine.
- However, the code does not actually provide the structure or proofs: it uses `sorry` to fill the entire Group structure. This is a vacuous placeholder.

3) Final comparison:
- Conceptually, if the `sorry` were replaced by a correct construction, the code would faithfully formalize that O(n) forms a group under multiplication, matching the natural language statement.
- But per the auditing guidelines, the presence of a `sorry` in the key definition means the auxiliary definition is vacuous. Therefore, the translation fails despite being on the right track.

Grade rationale: The target statement and the intended formal object match well; the only issue is the vacuous placeholder. According to the rubric, this warrants a score where fixing the placeholder would make it faithful (grade ~6).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Uses Mathlib's matrix and algebra infrastructure.
- variable {n : Type} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]: The matrix index set is an arbitrary finite type n with decidable equality, which is Mathlib's standard way to represent n×n matrices. This is a mild generalization of ""n is a natural number"", but equivalent for finite dimensions.
- def idMat : Matrix n n ℝ := fun i j => if i = j then (1 : ℝ) else 0: Defines the identity matrix explicitly by its entries. This is the usual identity matrix.
- Theorem statement:
  identity_mem_of_nonempty_closed_under_products_and_inverses
  Given G : Set (Matrix n n ℝ),
  hypotheses:
  • h_nonempty : G.Nonempty (G is nonempty),
  • h_mul : ∀ A B, A ∈ G → B ∈ G → A * B ∈ G (closure under products),
  • h_inv : ∀ A ∈ G, ∃ B ∈ G, A * B = idMat ∧ B * A = idMat (closure under inverses, expressed as existence of a two-sided inverse within G),
  conclusion: idMat ∈ G.
- Proof:
  • Pick A ∈ G from nonemptiness.
  • From h_inv, get B ∈ G with A*B = idMat and B*A = idMat.
  • Using closure under multiplication, A*B ∈ G.
  • Rewrite A*B as idMat to conclude idMat ∈ G.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: ""Let G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) be a nonempty set closed under products and inverses (i.e., a matrix group). Prove that the identity matrix I belongs to G.""
- The Lean code assumes precisely: nonempty, closure under products, and closure under inverses (formulated as existence of a two-sided inverse in G for each A ∈ G). This is equivalent to the usual ""closed under inverses"" in the matrix setting, since A*B = I = B*A implies B is the matrix inverse of A.
- The proof follows the standard argument: pick A ∈ G and its inverse B ∈ G; then A*B = I ∈ G by closure.
- Minor formalization detail: n is an arbitrary finite type rather than a natural number, which is a standard harmless generalization in Mathlib.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; idMat is properly defined and used.

Final check: The two statements are essentially the same. The code exactly formalizes the intended assumptions and conclusion, with only a standard generalization of the index set. No discrepancies affecting meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem prod_of_reflections_is_rotation (A B : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)` introduces two real 2×2 matrices A and B.
- Hypotheses `hA : A.transpose * A = 1` and `hB : B.transpose * B = 1` assert that A and B are orthogonal matrices (AᵀA = I and BᵀB = I), i.e., A, B ∈ O(2).
- Hypotheses `hA' : A.det = -1` and `hB' : B.det = -1` assert that both A and B have determinant −1. In O(2), this characterizes reflections (improper orthogonal transformations) in 2D.
- The conclusion `(A * B).transpose * (A * B) = 1 ∧ (A * B).det = 1` asserts that the product AB is orthogonal and has determinant +1. This is exactly the condition for AB to be in SO(2), i.e., a rotation matrix.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: the product of any two reflection matrices in O(2) is a rotation matrix (i.e., an element of SO(2)). In 2D, a reflection matrix is precisely an orthogonal matrix with determinant −1. The code assumes exactly these properties for A and B, and concludes that AB is orthogonal with determinant +1, i.e., AB ∈ SO(2). This matches the statement precisely.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses the standard matrix characterizations: orthogonality via AᵀA = I, membership in SO(2) via AᵀA = I and det = 1. This aligns with the intended meanings.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions (matrices, transpose, determinant, identity).
- No strengthening or weakening: the dimension is fixed at 2, over ℝ, consistent with O(2) and SO(2). The conclusion is exactly that the product is in SO(2).
Thus, the translation is faithful with no discrepancies.

- `variable {F : Type} [Field F]`: Let F be a type equipped with a field structure; i.e., F is a field.
- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Define the 2×2 matrix E(t) with entries over F, indexed by Fin 2 for rows and columns.
  The definition `fun i j => if i = 0 then if j = 0 then 1 else t else if j = 0 then 0 else 1` gives:
  - Row i = 0: column j = 0 → 1; column j = 1 → t.

  Thus E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]] as intended.
- `theorem E_mul_E (s t : F) : E s * E t = E (s + t)`: States that for all s, t in F, the product of these matrices equals E(s + t).

- The Lean definition of E(t) exactly matches that matrix using Fin 2 indexing.
- The theorem statement exactly matches the desired identity for all s, t in F.

- The theorem is stated exactly as in the natural language. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the auditing instructions since we only assess translation faithfulness, not the proof.
- No generalization or specialization beyond the original statement; indices and matrix shape are correct.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- It fixes n ≥ 6 and considers two subgroups A, N of Perm (Fin n) (the full symmetric group on n letters represented as permutations of Fin n).
- Assumptions:
  - hN_subA: N ≤ A (N is a subgroup of A).
  - hN_normal: ∀ g ∈ A, ∀ x ∈ N, g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N (N is normal in A).
  - hN_proper: N ≠ A (N is a proper subgroup of A).
  - i : Fin n is a fixed point index.
- Conclusion: ∀ σ : Perm (Fin n), if σ ∈ A and σ i = i, then σ ∈ N. Equivalently, the point-stabilizer in A at i (the set of elements of A fixing i) is contained in N.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The original statement is specifically about A_n (the alternating group on n letters), not an arbitrary subgroup A ≤ Sym(n). It says: Let N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n; for fixed i, the subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n | σ(i) = i} is contained in N.
- The Lean code, however, never specifies that A is the alternating group A_n. It treats A as an arbitrary subgroup of Perm (Fin n) and aims to prove the stabilizer in A lies in N.
- The part “N contains G_i” is correctly reflected in the form “∀ σ ∈ A, σ i = i → σ ∈ N”. But the crucial identification A = A_n is missing; the code works for any subgroup A, which is a major change.

Step 3: Final check: Are the problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a strong and generally false generalization: for any subgroup A of Sym(n), any proper normal subgroup N of A contains the stabilizer of a point in A. The original is specifically about A_n and its point-stabilizer inside A_n.
- Additional minor notes:
  - Using Fin n vs {1, …, n} is fine.
  - The code includes hN_subA explicitly; in the original this is implicit since N ≤ A_n.
  - The comment says “intended to be A_n,” but comments are not formal content. The formal statement omits the alternating group.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it omits the defining feature A = A_n and thereby substantially changes the mathematical meaning.

  This defines a matrix over ℝ indexed by a finite type `n` such that: it has 1's on the diagonal, a `t` in the (i,j) entry, and 0 elsewhere. This is exactly the elementary matrix usually denoted I + t E_{ij}, corresponding to adding t times row j to row i when left-multiplying.

  This states that if i ≠ j, then the determinant of the above elementary matrix is 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines E_{ij}(t) as the elementary matrix obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i. The Lean definition implements precisely this: I on the diagonal, and t at (i,j).
- The statement to prove is that E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n). In Mathlib, membership in SL(n, ℝ) is equivalent to determinant equal to 1 (indeed SL is the special linear group det=1); thus proving `det = 1` is the correct formal target. The theorem asserts exactly this determinant equality under the condition i ≠ j.
- The index set is generalized from {1,…,n} to an arbitrary finite type `n`; this is a standard and acceptable generalization in Mathlib and does not change the substance.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `elementary_add_row` is concrete and correct.
- The theorem states `det = 1` rather than explicit membership in `SpecialLinearGroup`; this is mathematically equivalent and is the expected formalization step to conclude membership in SL(n). The comment clarifies the intended consequence.
- The ring is ℝ as in the natural language statement.

  States that for any t ∈ F, the product E(t)E(−t) equals the identity matrix, and also E(−t)E(t) equals the identity. This asserts that E(−t) is a two-sided inverse of E(t).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For a field F and E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]], show E(t)^{-1} = E(−t) for all t ∈ F.
- The Lean theorem states both E t * E (−t) = 1 and E (−t) * E t = 1. In a monoid (and in particular for matrices), a two-sided inverse is unique, so these equalities are equivalent to saying that E(−t) is the inverse of E(t), i.e., (E t)⁻¹ = E (−t). Thus the theorem statement is fully faithful (even slightly stronger by giving both left and right identities explicitly).
- The auxiliary definition E is correctly and faithfully defined as the given shear matrix; no vacuous placeholders are used. The proof is a `sorry`, but per the instructions we only evaluate the statement/translation, not the proof.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The code’s theorem is equivalent to the claim that E(−t) is the inverse of E(t) for all t ∈ F. There are no mismatches in hypotheses (field F), object (2×2 matrix), or conclusion. The code even provides both-sided identity equalities, which entail the inverse equality.

  This attempts to define a function that, given two subgroups G and H of GL n R, produces a subgroup of GL n R. However, it provides no construction and ends with `sorry`, a placeholder. Moreover, the type does not assert that the returned subgroup is the set-theoretic intersection G ∩ H (the meet G ⊓ H in lattice of subgroups); it merely returns some subgroup. So the body does not define the intersection nor prove any property about it.

2) Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let G, H ⊂ GL(n) be matrix groups (subgroups). Prove that G ∩ H is a matrix group. In Lean, a faithful formalization would either:
  - Define `G ⊓ H : Subgroup (GL n R)` (which is already available in Mathlib) or set `def subgroup_inter_GL (G H) := G ⊓ H` without any `sorry`, or
  - State a theorem relating the carrier set of the intersection and prove the subgroup axioms.
- The provided code fails because:
  - It uses `sorry`, a vacuous placeholder, so no legitimate construction or proof is given.
  - The signature returns an arbitrary `Subgroup (GL n R)` without tying it to the intersection. Even if it compiled, it could define any subgroup (e.g., ⊥), not necessarily G ∩ H.
- The generalization to an arbitrary commutative ring `R` and index type `n` with `[Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]` is acceptable and standard for `GL n R`, so that part is fine.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Natural language: explicitly about the intersection G ∩ H being a subgroup.
- Lean code: does not specify intersection; it just produces some subgroup and leaves it as `sorry`. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation. It is both vacuous (due to `sorry`) and too weak (no assertion that the result is G ∩ H).

- theorem H_mul_H0_in_SO ... : is_special_orthogonal_2 (H * H0): Similarly, H * H0 is in SO(2).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: For any 2×2 improper orthogonal matrix H (H ∈ O(2) and det H = -1), both H0 H and H H0 lie in SO(2), with H0 = diag(1, -1).
- The Lean code exactly encodes this: it works over 2×2 real matrices, defines H0 as diag(1, -1), defines O(2) by MᵀM = I, defines SO(2) by orthogonality plus det = 1, and states two theorems asserting H0H and HH0 are in SO(2) under the hypothesis that H is orthogonal with det = -1.

Checks and potential discrepancies:
- The predicates are non-vacuous and standard. No placeholder or vacuous definitions are used.
- Using transpose instead of conjugate transpose is appropriate over ℝ.
- Stating the two conclusions as separate theorems is faithful to “both belong to SO(2)”.
- The absence of proofs (sorry) is acceptable for translation auditing per the instructions.
- Restriction to ℝ matches the usual interpretation of O(2), SO(2).

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- noncomputable section: Standard, not relevant to the mathematical content.
- def H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), -cos(2θ)]]: This defines, for each real θ, a 2×2 real matrix H(θ) whose entries are cos(2θ), sin(2θ), etc. This is precisely the standard matrix of the reflection across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis.
- theorem H_linear (θ : ℝ) ...: States that the map v ↦ (H θ).mulVec v is linear, i.e., it respects linear combinations a•v + b•w. This matches the claim that the reflection is a linear operator.
- theorem H_is_orthogonal (θ : ℝ) : (H θ)ᵀ * (H θ) = 1: States that H(θ) is orthogonal in the matrix sense (its transpose is its inverse). This is the defining matrix condition for orthogonality and hence membership in O(2).
- theorem H_det_neg_one (θ : ℝ) : (H θ).det = -1: States that the determinant of H(θ) is −1, i.e., it is an improper orthogonal matrix.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: for each θ, the reflection across the specified line is linear, and its matrix H_θ is an improper orthogonal matrix (in O(2) with det = −1).
- The code defines the standard reflection matrix for that line and proves linearity of the induced linear map via mulVec (H_linear). It also states orthogonality ((H θ)^T H θ = I) and determinant −1. These match exactly the two properties in the statement.
- The code does not explicitly use the OrthogonalGroup O(2) type but uses the equivalent matrix equation for orthogonality, which is standard and faithful.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The matrix defined is the standard reflection matrix for a line at angle θ. The code asserts linearity of the operator and the properties characterizing an improper orthogonal matrix: orthogonality and det = −1. There are no vacuous placeholders; the only uses of `sorry` are in proofs, not in definitions or in weakening the statements. The translation is faithful to the original mathematical statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib's library.
- Comment explains the intended interpretation: α = (0 1), β = (0 1 2) in Perm (Fin 3), and G = ⟨α, β⟩; show G = S_3 (the full symmetric group on 3 letters).
- def α : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 1: Define α to be the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in the permutation group on Fin 3 = {0,1,2}. This corresponds to the cycle (0 1).
- def β : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := (Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 2) * (Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 1): Define β as the product of swaps (0 2) and (0 1). In Mathlib, group multiplication is function composition with (p * q) x = p (q x), so β maps 0→1, 1→2, 2→0, i.e., the 3-cycle (0 1 2).
- theorem generated_is_S3 : Subgroup.closure ({α, β} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3))) := by sorry: The subgroup generated by α and β equals the top subgroup of Equiv.Perm (Fin 3), i.e., the whole symmetric group S_3. Proof omitted (sorry), but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement uses S_3 on {1,2,3} with α=(1,2) and β=(1,2,3). The Lean code uses Fin 3 = {0,1,2}. The mapping from {1,2,3} to {0,1,2} (1↦0, 2↦1, 3↦2) translates (1,2) to (0,1) and (1,2,3) to (0,1,2). β is constructed as (0 2)(0 1), which indeed equals the 3-cycle (0 1 2) under Mathlib's composition convention. So α and β correspond exactly to the intended permutations.
- The theorem states the subgroup generated by {α, β} is the entire group Equiv.Perm (Fin 3), which is precisely S_3. This matches “Show that G = S_3.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Only a notational/indexing shift (1-based vs 0-based). No change in mathematical content.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: α and β are genuine permutations; the theorem states a genuine equality of subgroups. Proof is omitted, which is allowed.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {n : Type _} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: We work over real n×n matrices indexed by a finite type n (not necessarily Nat, but any finite type). This is a standard generalization and fine.
- `def SO : Set ((Matrix n n ℝ)ˣ) := {A | (A : Matrix n n ℝ)ᵀ * (A : Matrix n n ℝ) = 1 ∧ Matrix.det (A : Matrix n n ℝ) = 1}`: Defines SO(n) as the set of invertible matrices (units) whose underlying matrix satisfies Aᵀ A = I and det A = 1. This is exactly the usual definition {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1}, with the understanding that orthogonal matrices are invertible, so restricting to units is natural.
- `def SO_is_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix n n ℝ)ˣ) := by sorry`: Claims to construct a subgroup of the group of invertible matrices, intended to show SO(n) is a matrix group (a subgroup of GL_n(ℝ)). However, the entire subgroup structure is filled with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement asks to prove that SO(n) = {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group. The code’s definition of SO directly matches the set {A : Aᵀ A = I, det A = 1} within the invertible matrices, which is equivalent to the described set. So the set-level definition is faithful.
- The second part (“is a matrix group”) should be formalized as giving SO the structure of a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ). The code attempts this via `SO_is_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix n n ℝ)ˣ)`, but the construction is left as `sorry`. This is a vacuous placeholder for the crucial assertion and thus fails the guideline that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical content intended is correct: SO is defined as orthogonal with determinant 1, and claiming it forms a subgroup of invertible matrices matches “matrix group.”
- However, the key part (establishing the subgroup structure) is provided as a `sorry`, i.e., no actual definition/proof is given. According to the provided guidelines, this makes the translation fail.
- Minor differences (using a general finite type index n instead of Nat) are acceptable generalizations.

Conclusion: While the set-level definition of SO is faithful, the claim that it is a matrix group is not actually formalized (vacuously filled by `sorry`). Therefore, the translation is not faithful overall.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `structure ring_axioms (R : Type u) where` defines a structure intended to package the three listed axioms.
  - `add_comm_group : AddCommGroup R` says that (R, +) is an abelian group with identity 0 (this includes +, 0, neg, associativity, commutativity, inverses).
  - `monoid : Monoid R` says that (R, ·) is a monoid with identity 1 (this includes ·, 1, associativity).
  - `left_distrib   : ∀ a b c : R, (a * (b + c) : R) = (a * b + a * c : R)` is the left distributive law a(b+c)=ab+ac for all a,b,c.
  - `right_distrib  : ∀ a b c : R, ((b + c) * a : R) = (b * a + c * a : R)` is the right distributive law (b+c)a=ba+ca for all a,b,c.
  These fields match exactly the three numbered conditions in the natural language statement.

- `def ring_equiv_axioms (R : Type u) : Ring R ≃ ring_axioms R := by sorry` states a type-level equivalence between Lean’s `Ring R` structure and the freshly defined `ring_axioms R`. This is a formalization of “R is a ring iff the three axioms hold,” phrased as an equivalence of the data/axioms that define those structures.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- Conceptually, `ring_axioms R` captures precisely the three conditions: (1) additive abelian group, (2) multiplicative monoid, (3) both distributive laws. That matches the natural language statement.
- Expressing the “iff” as an equivalence of structures `Ring R ≃ ring_axioms R` is a reasonable formalization.

Issues:
- The definition `ring_equiv_axioms` is given with `by sorry`, i.e., a placeholder proof. Per the guidelines, any auxiliary definition filled with `sorry` counts as vacuous and causes the translation to fail.
- A technical concern: inside `ring_axioms`, the distributive laws use `+` and `*` notations that Lean obtains from typeclass instances in scope. The fields `add_comm_group : AddCommGroup R` and `monoid : Monoid R` store operations, but they are not made into instances within the structure, so the `+` and `*` used in `left_distrib`/`right_distrib` may not be tied to those fields unless there are global instances already in scope that match. This could cause a mismatch between the operations used in the distributive axioms and those packaged by the fields, although conceptually the intent is clear. This is a design quirk that could be fixed by structuring the definition differently (e.g., parameterizing by instances or bundling operations explicitly), but as written it risks not strictly enforcing that the distributive laws refer to the same operations as in the fields.

Final check:
- Mathematically, the structure `ring_axioms` matches the listed conditions, and the stated equivalence expresses the desired “iff.”
- However, the presence of `sorry` means the main equivalence is a placeholder, which violates the no-vacuous-definitions guideline, so the translation fails on that ground.

Grade rationale:
- The idea is correct and close to faithful, but it uses a vacuous `sorry`. If that were fixed (and the minor instance-scoping issue addressed), the result would be faithful. This fits a grade of 6 per the rubric.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: n is a finite index type with decidable equality; R is a commutative ring. We are working with matrices Matrix n n R.
- def is_diagonal (A : Matrix n n R) : Prop := ∀ i j, i ≠ j → A i j = 0
  Translation: A matrix A is diagonal if all off-diagonal entries are zero. This is a legitimate definition matching the usual notion of a diagonal matrix.
- def D1 : Set (Units (Matrix n n R)) := {U | is_diagonal (U.val) ∧ (U.val).det = 1}
  Translation: D1 is the set of invertible n×n matrices (as units) whose underlying matrix is diagonal and has determinant 1. This matches “the diagonal matrices in SL(n)” interpreted as a subset of GL(n) (the units), since det = 1 implies invertibility over a commutative ring.
- def D1_is_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) := by sorry
  Translation: They intend to define a subgroup of the group of units, presumably consisting of the elements of D1, i.e., to show D1 forms a subgroup (a “matrix group”). However, this definition is left as a placeholder using `sorry` and does not even mention D1 in its type; it could define any subgroup. Thus it neither constructs nor proves that the carrier is exactly D1.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The statement: “Let D1(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n). Show that D1(n) is a matrix group.” In formal terms, this asks to prove that D1(n) is a subgroup of GL(n) (or equivalently to define a Subgroup whose carrier is D1). The code correctly defines the set D1 as the diagonal determinant-1 invertible matrices, which matches the intended D1(n), and works over a general commutative ring (a reasonable slight generalization).
- However, the crucial part—showing/defining that D1 is a subgroup—is not carried out: `D1_is_subgroup` is a bare `Subgroup` with `sorry`, and it does not tie the subgroup to the set `D1` at all. This is a significant mismatch.

Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? No. The Lean code does not faithfully assert or prove that D1 is a subgroup. It introduces D1 as a set but then gives an unrelated (and vacuous) `def` of a subgroup with a `sorry`. According to the guidelines, the presence of `sorry` and the lack of connection to `D1` mean the translation fails.

Grade rationale:
- There is one vacuous placeholder and the final subgroup is not linked to D1, but if the `def` were properly filled by constructing a Subgroup with carrier = D1 (and closure proofs), it would be faithful. Hence this fits the rubric: makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, the final result would be faithful.

No. The original statement asserts a specific group-theoretic fact: that the quaternion group Q is presented by generators a, b with relations a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2, i.e., that Q is isomorphic to the group with that presentation.

They are different. The natural language statement is a specific, meaningful group-theoretic isomorphism/presentation statement. The Lean code's theorem is unrelated (it states `True`).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: just imports and namespace opening.
- Comment: “Let A be an orthogonal n×n real matrix (Aᵀ ⬝ A = 1). Then its columns form an orthonormal family and span ℝ^n.” This is the intended meaning.
- Theorem statement:
  - Parameters: `n : Nat`, `[DecidableEq (Fin n)]`, `[InnerProductSpace ℝ (Fin n → ℝ)]`, `A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ`.
  - Hypothesis: `h : A.transpose ⬝ A = 1` (i.e., A is orthogonal: Aᵀ A = I).
  - Conclusion: `Orthonormal ℝ (fun i : Fin n => A.col i) ∧ span ℝ (Set.range fun i : Fin n => A.col i) = (⊤ : Submodule ℝ (Fin n → ℝ))`.
    - This says: the columns of A form an orthonormal family, and their ℝ-span is the whole space (Fin n → ℝ), i.e., ℝ^n. Together, this is equivalent to saying the columns form an orthonormal basis of ℝ^n.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let A ∈ O(n) with columns A₁, …, Aₙ. Deduce that {A₁, …, Aₙ} is an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ (with the standard Euclidean inner product).
- Lean: Assumes Aᵀ A = I and concludes the columns are orthonormal and span ℝ^n. This structurally matches the intended result: orthonormal family + span = ⊤ is an orthonormal basis.

Key discrepancy:
- The code introduces an arbitrary `[InnerProductSpace ℝ (Fin n → ℝ)]` instance and uses `Orthonormal ℝ` relative to that unspecified inner product. However, the hypothesis `A.transpose ⬝ A = 1` refers to the standard matrix multiplication and does not depend on that inner product. The classical implication “Aᵀ A = I ⇒ columns are orthonormal” is true specifically for the standard Euclidean inner product (dot product) on ℝ^n. For a general, possibly nonstandard inner product on `(Fin n → ℝ)`, `Aᵀ A = I` need not imply that the columns are orthonormal with respect to that inner product.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is actually stronger (and generally false) unless the inner product is the standard one. This makes the translation not faithful.

Other aspects:
- Using `(Fin n → ℝ)` for ℝ^n is fine.
- Concluding span = ⊤ is appropriate to say they form a basis (since orthonormal implies linear independence).
- No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions are introduced; only a theorem with a `sorry` proof.

Conclusion:
- While very close in spirit, the code fails to fix the standard inner product and thus does not faithfully translate the original statement. A faithful version should either:
  - Use `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` in place of `(Fin n → ℝ)`, or
  - Explicitly use the standard inner product (dot product) on `(Fin n → ℝ)`, or
  - Avoid typeclass polymorphism by referencing the dot product directly.

Grade rationale:
- Almost correct structure and conclusions, but the inner product mismatch is a substantive fidelity issue. Hence not faithful; grade 8.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code works in Mathlib with permutations `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, which model the symmetric group S_n on the set `Fin n = {0,1,...,n-1}`. This is standard and equivalent to S_n on `{1,...,n}` up to relabeling.
- The theorem `even_length_of_prod_eq_one_of_isSwap` takes:
  - `n : ℕ` with `hn : 1 ≤ n` (matching the natural statement's n ≥ 1),
  - a list `l : List (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` representing a product (composition) of permutations,
  - a hypothesis `hl` that every `g ∈ l` is a transposition, formally: there exist `a b : Fin n`, `a ≠ b`, with `g = Equiv.swap a b`,
  - a hypothesis `h : l.prod = 1`, saying the product of the list (composition of permutations) equals the identity permutation.
- The conclusion is `Even l.length`, i.e., the number of transpositions in the factorization is even.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For n ≥ 1, in S_n, any factorization of the identity permutation as a product of transpositions uses an even number of transpositions.
- The Lean formalization matches this precisely:
  - S_n is represented as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.
  - “Factorization as a product of transpositions” is realized by a list `l` whose elements are all swaps `Equiv.swap a b` with `a ≠ b`.
  - The product equals identity is `l.prod = 1`.
  - The conclusion is that the number of factors (`l.length`) is even.
- The slight notational difference `{1,...,n}` vs `Fin n` is a standard harmless change of indexing. The order of multiplication in the list product is also immaterial for the parity conclusion, and the statement quantifies over an arbitrary list, so it captures “every factorization”.
- There are no placeholder/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same in mathematical content. No extra or missing conditions. The `n ≥ 1` assumption matches. The formalization is accurate and uses standard Mathlib notions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def rho : ℝ → (Fin 2 → ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] (Fin 2 → ℝ) := fun _ => LinearIsometryEquiv.refl ℝ (Fin 2 → ℝ)`
  This defines a function rho that assigns to each real number θ the identity linear isometric equivalence on ℝ^2 (modeled as `Fin 2 → ℝ`). In other words, for every θ, `rho θ` is the identity map; it does not depend on θ and does not represent rotation by angle θ.

- `theorem so2_equiv_rotations : (↥(Matrix.specialOrthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ)) ≃ { f : (Fin 2 → ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] (Fin 2 → ℝ) | ∃ θ : ℝ, f = rho θ } := by sorry`
  This states there is a bijection of types between SO(2) (the special orthogonal group over ℝ in dimension 2) and the subtype of linear isometric equivalences of ℝ^2 consisting of those equal to `rho θ` for some θ. Since `rho θ` is constantly the identity, the right-hand set is just the singleton {id}. Moreover, the symbol `≃` denotes a type equivalence, not a group isomorphism.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: SO(2) is isomorphic (as a group) to the group {ρ_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} of rotations of ℝ^2.

Issues in the Lean code relative to this:
- The definition of `rho` is incorrect: it is the constant identity map, not the rotation by angle θ. Thus the set `{ f | ∃ θ, f = rho θ }` is just the singleton {id}, not the full group of rotations. This is a fundamental mismatch.
- The theorem claims a mere type equivalence `≃`, not a group isomorphism `≃*`. The natural language asserts a group isomorphism.
- The RHS is presented as a subtype of linear isometric equivalences; while this is a reasonable model for the group of rotations if `rho` were correctly defined and the group structure (composition) acknowledged, the current statement neither equips the RHS with a group structure nor claims a homomorphism property.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The Lean code, as stated, asserts a bijection between SO(2) and a singleton set (since `rho` is constant). This is false and not faithful to the intended claim. Even fixing `rho` to be the true rotation by θ, the statement would still only be a type equivalence, not a group isomorphism, so it would remain not faithful to ""isomorphic as groups.""

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language
- `variable {n : Type _} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: We work with n×n matrices indexed by a finite type n with decidable equality.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: The entries are in a commutative ring R.
- `def is_diagonal (A : Matrix n n R) : Prop := ∀ i j, i ≠ j → A i j = 0`: A matrix A is diagonal if every off-diagonal entry is zero.
- `theorem diag_units_subgroup : ∃ H : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)), ∀ u : Units (Matrix n n R), u ∈ H ↔ is_diagonal (u : Matrix n n R)`: There exists a subgroup H of the group of invertible matrices (i.e., GL(n,R) modeled as Units (Matrix n n R)) such that an invertible matrix u lies in H if and only if its underlying matrix is diagonal.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural statement defines D(n) as the set of all diagonal matrices in GL(n) and asks to show D(n) is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup of GL(n)).
- The Lean theorem asserts the existence of a subgroup H of GL(n,R) whose elements are precisely the invertible matrices whose underlying matrix is diagonal. This exactly captures “the set of diagonal matrices in GL(n) forms a subgroup.”
- Using Units (Matrix n n R) for GL(n,R) is standard and faithful. The definition of is_diagonal is standard. The equivalence `u ∈ H ↔ is_diagonal (u : Matrix ...)` ensures H’s carrier set equals D(n).

Step 3: Compare for differences
- Slight generalization: n is any finite index type, not necessarily {1,…,n}, and R is any commutative ring (not necessarily a field). This is a standard harmless generalization and remains faithful to the intent.
- No vacuous placeholders: is_diagonal is a genuine definition; the theorem is a clean existence statement of the subgroup.
- Domain restriction to Units ensures we are indeed talking about diagonal matrices in GL(n), not all diagonal matrices.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the statement that the set of diagonal invertible matrices forms a subgroup of GL(n).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: bring in Mathlib and the Equiv namespace for permutations.
- The theorem statement: For a natural number n with h: 2 ≤ n, consider the symmetric group on n letters modeled as `Equiv.Perm (Fin (n - 1 + 1))` (definitionally equal to `Fin n`). The set inside `Subgroup.closure` is `Set.range (fun k : Fin (n - 1) => Equiv.swap (Fin.castSucc k) (Fin.succ k))`. Here `k : Fin (n - 1)` ranges over 0,1,...,n-2. For each k, `Fin.castSucc k : Fin n` is the same index k viewed in `Fin n`, and `Fin.succ k : Fin n` is k+1. Thus `Equiv.swap (Fin.castSucc k) (Fin.succ k)` is the adjacent transposition swapping k and k+1 in `Fin n`. Taking `Set.range` collects exactly the adjacent transpositions (0,1), (1,2), ..., (n-2,n-1). The theorem asserts that the subgroup generated by these (i.e., the closure of that set in the subgroup lattice) equals `⊤`, the whole group `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For n ≥ 2, S_n is generated by the adjacent transpositions {(1,2),(2,3),...,(n-1,n)}.
- The Lean code states the same for permutations of `Fin n`, where indices run 0..n-1, so the adjacent transpositions are (0,1),...,(n-2,n-1). This is the usual off-by-one indexing shift between `Fin n` and {1,...,n}. The use of `Subgroup.closure` exactly captures “generated by”. Equality to `⊤` states that these generators produce the whole symmetric group.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing shift: the Lean code uses 0-based indexing (Fin n) instead of 1-based indexing. This is a harmless conventional difference.
- Writing `n` as `n - 1 + 1` is a technical device to avoid definitional equalities; it does not change the meaning.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. All objects are standard Mathlib constructs.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Use mathlib library.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem sgn_mul {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 ≤ n) (α β : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : ...` says: For a natural number n with n ≥ 1, and α, β permutations of Fin n (i.e., the set {0, ..., n-1}), we assert an equality about their sign.
- `Equiv.Perm.sign (α.trans β) = Equiv.Perm.sign α * Equiv.Perm.sign β`: The sign of the composition α.trans β equals the product of the signs of α and β. Here, `Equiv.Perm.sign` is the sign homomorphism taking values in the multiplicative group {±1}, and `trans` is composition of permutations (α followed by β or equivalently β ∘ α). No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is just a theorem statement with `sorry` proof (acceptable for translation auditing).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let n ≥ 1 and S_n be the symmetric group on {1,...,n}. For any α, β ∈ S_n, prove sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β).
- Lean: Works with `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, which is the standard formalization of S_n (on {0, ..., n-1}). This is a harmless indexing shift and standard in formalization. The hypothesis `hn : 1 ≤ n` matches the natural statement’s n ≥ 1. The conclusion states multiplicativity of the sign under composition.
- The use of `α.trans β` corresponds to composing permutations. In many mathematical conventions, αβ denotes the composition applying β first then α, which aligns with an appropriate interpretation of `trans`. Even if there were a minor order convention mismatch, the codomain {±1} is abelian so the right-hand side product is commutative, and the identity stated remains the intended multiplicativity of sign.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Domain: S_n vs permutations of Fin n (indexing shift) — equivalent.
- Condition n ≥ 1 — present in both.
- Statement: sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β) — captured as sign of composition equals product of signs.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions. No mismatch in mathematical meaning.

- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Define the 2×2 matrix-valued function E(t) over F with entries E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]]. The code uses case splits on indices i, j ∈ Fin 2 to assign 1 on the diagonal, t in the (0,1) position, and 0 in the (1,0) position.

Although only a left inverse is explicitly stated, the first two properties imply E(-t)E(t) = E(0) = I as well.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language request is to show that G = {E(t) : t ∈ F} is a matrix group under multiplication. The Lean code defines E and G exactly as described and states the standard group properties for G in terms of the parameterization by t ∈ F: closure (via E(t+u)), identity (E(0) = I), and inverses (E(-t)). Associativity is inherited from matrix multiplication and need not be restated. The theorem does not literally say “G is a subgroup” (e.g., it does not construct a Subgroup), but the given equalities are precisely what one proves to establish that G is a group under multiplication in the usual sense.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not explicitly mention G in the theorem statement, but it expresses the group axioms via the parameterization E(t), which is equivalent since G is exactly the range of E.
- Only the left inverse equation is explicitly stated; however, from E(t)E(u)=E(t+u) and E(0)=I, one immediately gets E(-t)E(t)=E(0)=I, so two-sided inverses are ensured.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; E and G are defined concretely. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions since we are auditing the translation of the statement, not its proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully captures the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: “Show that if m, n are relatively prime then C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n (C_n is the cyclic group of order n).”
- In Mathlib, ZMod k is the standard model for the cyclic group of order k when k > 0, with additive notation. An `AddEquiv` is precisely a group isomorphism in the additive setting. The product `ZMod m × ZMod n` is the direct product of the additive cyclic groups. Thus, for positive m, n, the Lean statement is exactly the Chinese remainder isomorphism C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The code does not restrict m, n ≥ 1. When m or n is 0, `ZMod 0` is isomorphic to ℤ, not a finite cyclic group, while “C_n” as stated typically assumes n ≥ 1 (order n). So the Lean statement is a slight generalization beyond the intended domain of “groups of order n.” However, when m, n ≥ 1, it matches perfectly.
- Notational difference (additive vs abstract group) is standard and faithful here.
- No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced; the only omission is the proof, which is acceptable for translation assessment.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the intended result, with a slight generalization to include the n = 0 case via ZMod, which is acceptable.

- Conclusion `∀ g : G, ∀ h : H, (g * (h : G) * g⁻¹ : G) ∈ (H : Set G)`: For every g in G and every h in H, the conjugate g h g^{-1} lies in H. This is a standard characterization of normality of H in G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If H is a subgroup of order n in G and H is the only subgroup of order n, then H is normal in G.
- Lean statement: Assumes H is finite (so has some order n = |H|). It assumes uniqueness among all finite subgroups with the same order as H (which exactly captures “only subgroup of order n”). The conclusion is the conjugation-closed property: ∀ g, h, g h g^{-1} ∈ H, which is equivalent to H being normal. Thus, the Lean statement faithfully expresses the intended theorem.

3) Final comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The Lean code does not explicitly name n, but uses `Fintype.card H` implicitly as n. This is standard and faithful.
- The uniqueness hypothesis ranges over finite subgroups, which is appropriate since “order n” entails finiteness.
- The conclusion is given in a form equivalent to normality. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are from Mathlib. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions focusing on statement faithfulness.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv Function`: Bring in mathlib and open namespaces for equivalences and functions.
- The docstring explains the plan: represent the set {1, ..., n} as `Fin n` (i.e., 0..n-1). The transposition (1 2) is implemented as `Equiv.swap (0 : Fin n) 1`, and the n-cycle (1 2 ... n) is implemented as the permutation `x ↦ x + 1` on `Fin n` (addition modulo n).
- `noncomputable def perm_add_one (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) := ...` defines the permutation that sends each element of `Fin n` to `x + 1` (mod n). This is an equivalence by providing a bijectivity proof via `Equiv.ofBijective`. The proof sketch:
  - Assumes `NeZero n` from `1 < n`.
  - Injectivity: if `x + 1 = y + 1` in `Fin n`, then applying `Fin.val` and simplifying shows `x = y`.
  - Surjectivity: given `y`, exhibits a preimage `x` (something like `y - 1` mod `n`, written using a suitable `Fin.ofNat` construction) and simplifies to show `(x + 1) = y`.
  Thus `perm_add_one n hn` is exactly the permutation adding 1 modulo n, i.e., the n-cycle `(0 1 2 ... n-1)` on `Fin n`.
- `theorem S_n_generated_by_swap_and_cycle (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) : Subgroup.closure ({Equiv.swap (0 : Fin n) 1, perm_add_one n hn} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) = ⊤ := by sorry` states that, for `n ≥ 2`, the subgroup of the symmetric group on `Fin n` generated by the two elements `swap (0) 1` (the transposition of 0 and 1) and `perm_add_one n hn` (the n-cycle adding 1) is the whole group `⊤` (i.e., all permutations of `Fin n`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: “Let n ≥ 2. Prove that S_n is generated by the two elements S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}.”
- Lean: For `n ≥ 2`, the closure (generated subgroup) of the set `{swap (0) 1, perm_add_one n hn}` inside `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` equals `⊤`.
- Representation alignment:
  - `S_n` is represented by `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` (permutations of `Fin n`), which is the standard formalization of the symmetric group on n letters.
  - The transposition `(1,2)` is represented as `swap (0) 1` on `Fin n` (0-based indexing), exactly matching `(1,2)` under 1-based indexing.
  - The cycle `(1,2,...,n)` is represented as `x ↦ x + 1` modulo `n` on `Fin n`, i.e., the cycle `(0,1,2,...,n-1)`, which corresponds to `(1,2,...,n)` under the index shift.
  - “Generated by” is exactly formalized by `Subgroup.closure {…} = ⊤`.
- The hypothesis `1 < n` matches `n ≥ 2`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing convention difference (0..n-1 vs 1..n) is explicitly handled and is mathematically equivalent.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; `perm_add_one` is a real permutation constructed via bijectivity.
- The theorem statement precisely matches the natural language claim in content.

- `variable {G H : Type _} [Group G] [Group H] (f : G →* H)` declares two types G and H with group structures and a homomorphism f from G to H (MonoidHom in Lean covers group homomorphisms when the domains are groups).
- The theorem `MonoidHom.injective_iff_ker_eq_bot : Function.Injective (f : G → H) ↔ f.ker = (⊥ : Subgroup G)` states that the underlying function of f is injective if and only if the kernel of f equals the bottom (trivial) subgroup of G.

The natural language statement says: for a group homomorphism f: G → H with kernel K, f is injective iff K is the trivial subgroup. The Lean statement expresses exactly this, using `f.ker` for the kernel and `⊥ : Subgroup G` for the trivial subgroup, and `Function.Injective (f : G → H)` for injectivity. The absence of an explicit variable K is immaterial; `f.ker = ⊥` is precisely “the kernel K is trivial.”

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code quantifies over groups G, H and a group homomorphism f. This matches the context.
- It uses the standard Mathlib notions: `MonoidHom`, `Subgroup`, `ker`, and `⊥`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The equivalence is stated exactly as in the natural language statement.
There are no substantive differences.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in the Mathlib library.

  Natural language: In any group G, if elements a and b satisfy a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1, and b a = a^2 b, then a = 1. This is an auxiliary lemma statement (left unproved with sorry), not directly the presented-group-isomorphic-to-Z2 claim, but thematically related.
- theorem presented_group_is_Z2 : True := by sorry
  Natural language: A theorem asserting simply True. The comment says it is meant to state that the group given by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to ZMod 2, but the actual formal statement is just True, which is vacuous and does not encode the intended mathematical content. No formalization of the presented group or an isomorphism to ZMod 2 appears.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the original statement?
No. The key natural language statement is: ""Show that the group given by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to ℤ_2."" The Lean code does not define this presented group, nor does it assert or construct an isomorphism to ZMod 2. The main theorem is replaced by a vacuous proposition (True). The auxiliary lemma is relevant and plausible, but it is not the main claim and is left unproved.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The original asks for an isomorphism between a specific presented group and ℤ_2. The code’s final theorem states only True and does not mention presentations or ZMod 2. There is no formalization of a presented group, no quotient by relations, and no isomorphism. Thus the translation is not faithful. The auxiliary lemma is on-topic but insufficient and not a substitute for the central claim.

Discrepancies:
- The main theorem is vacuous (""True"") instead of the intended isomorphism statement.
- No definition or use of a presented group/presentation machinery.
- No mention of ZMod 2 in the formal theorem.
- Proofs are omitted (which is acceptable per instructions), but the principal issue is that the final statement itself is not the right one.

Given these, the code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The definition is_field_like (F add mul zero one neg inv) : Prop packages a list of axioms:
  - Additive part:
    - ∀ a b, add a b = add b a (commutativity)
    - ∀ a b c, add a (add b c) = add (add a b) c (associativity)
    - ∀ a, add a zero = a (right identity)
    - ∀ a, add (neg a) a = zero (left inverse)
    Together with commutativity, these are the usual axioms of an abelian group with identity zero on (F, add).
  - Multiplicative part:
    - ∀ a b c, mul a (mul b c) = mul (mul a b) c (associativity)
    - ∀ a b, mul a b = mul b a (commutativity)
    - ∀ a, mul a one = a (right identity; by commutativity also left identity)
    - ∀ a, a ≠ zero → mul a (inv a) = one (invertibility for nonzero elements; by commutativity also inv a • a = 1)
  - Distinct identities and distributivity:
    - one ≠ zero
    - ∀ a b c, mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c) (left distributivity; right distributivity follows from commutativity of mul)

- The theorem field_structure_exists_iff_axioms states: For any type F, there exists a Field structure on F if and only if there exist operations add, mul, constants zero, one, and unary operations neg, inv on F making is_field_like true. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but the statement intends an equivalence between a mathlib Field structure and the explicit axioms bundled in is_field_like.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: Let F be a set with two binary operations + and ·. Show that F is a field iff: (1) (F,+) is an abelian group with identity 0; (2) (F\{0},·) is an abelian group with identity 1; (3) 1 ≠ 0; (4) a(b+c) = ab + ac for all a,b,c.
- The Lean predicate is_field_like encodes exactly these conditions in a standard algebraic presentation:
  - (1) is encoded by the additive axioms.
  - (2) is captured by multiplicative associativity, commutativity, identity one, and the existence of inverses for nonzero elements via inv, which is an equivalent way to express that the nonzero elements form an abelian group. Closure of F\{0} under multiplication can be derived from these axioms together with distributivity (giving 0 as absorbing) and invertibility; but even at the axiom level, requiring an inverse for each nonzero element is the standard encoding in algebraic structures like fields.
  - (3) is directly included as one ≠ zero.
  - (4) is the distributivity axiom mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c). Right distributivity follows from commutativity of multiplication and so is not separately needed.
- The theorem’s quantification is existential over the operations, whereas the natural language says “with two binary operations + and ·”. This is a harmless shift of viewpoint: “F is a field” in mathlib already bundles the operations; the theorem states equivalence between having some operations making the axioms true and having a Field structure. This matches the intended iff statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No vacuous placeholders: is_field_like contains concrete axioms. The theorem uses an unproven sorry but that is acceptable for translation assessment.
- Minor presentational differences:
  - The Lean statement existentially quantifies all operations (including neg and inv) rather than assuming given + and ·. This is a standard and faithful formalization of “there exists a field structure”.
  - The natural statement phrases (2) as a group on F\{0}. The Lean axioms encode this via a total inv on F with the property restricted to a ≠ 0, which is a standard approach and equivalent in the presence of the other axioms.
  - Only left distributivity is stated, matching the natural statement; right distributivity is derivable.
These are acceptable and faithful formalization choices. The mathematical content matches the original statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully captures the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem not_solvable_of_iso_S5 {G : Type _} [Group G] (φ : G ≃* Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)) (hS5_not_solvable : ¬ IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm (Fin 5))) : ¬ IsSolvable G := by sorry`
  In words: For any group G, if there is a group isomorphism φ from G to S5 (the permutation group on 5 elements, represented as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)`), and if S5 is not solvable, then G is not solvable. The proof is omitted (`sorry`). There are no auxiliary definitions; all concepts used are standard Mathlib notions (group, isomorphism, `IsSolvable`).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Using that A5 is simple and the Galois group of the general quintic is S5, prove that the roots of a general quintic cannot be expressed in terms of radicals. The classical argument requires:
  - A5 simple non-abelian implies S5 is not solvable.
  - The general quintic has Galois group S5.
  - A polynomial is solvable by radicals implies its Galois group is solvable.
  - Therefore the general quintic is not solvable by radicals.
- The Lean theorem here only states: If a group G is isomorphic to S5 and S5 is not solvable, then G is not solvable. This is a small group-theoretic lemma (solvability preserved under isomorphism and transported from S5), and it does not mention polynomials, radicals, fields, or Galois groups. It also assumes non-solvability of S5 rather than deriving it from simplicity of A5, and does not connect group non-solvability to non-solvability by radicals of a polynomial. Thus it captures only a tiny sub-lemma and not the main claim.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a general group-theory lemma: if G ≅ S5 and S5 is not solvable, then G is not solvable. The natural language problem is about the unsolvability by radicals of the general quintic, requiring field-theoretic and Galois-theoretic content linking radical solvability to group solvability and using that the relevant Galois group is S5. The Lean code omits these crucial parts and thus is not a faithful translation of the original statement.

Differences found:
- Missing any mention of polynomials, radicals, fields, or Galois groups.
- Does not use the fact about A5 being simple; instead assumes S5 is not solvable.
- Concludes only non-solvability of a group isomorphic to S5, not the non-solvability by radicals of the general quintic.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

The natural language statement asserts two mathematical facts: (i) SL(n) is a normal subgroup of GL(n); (ii) GL(n)/SL(n) is isomorphic to R^× (the multiplicative group of real numbers).

The provided code does none of this: it contains no definitions, no theorems, no statements about normality or quotients, and no isomorphism. It merely checks the identifier `GL`.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem internal_direct_product_pairwise_intersection_trivial {G : Type _} [Group G] {n : Nat} (H : Fin n → Subgroup G) ...`:
  We fix a group G and an indexed family of subgroups H_i (indexed by i : Fin n).

- Hypothesis `h_unique : ∀ g : G, ∃! f : Fin n → G, (∀ i, f i ∈ H i) ∧ g = List.prod (List.ofFn f)`:
  For every element g in G, there exists a unique function f from indices i to elements of G such that each component f i lies in the subgroup H_i, and the ordered product of these components (in the natural order 0,1,...,n-1 on Fin n) equals g. In words: every g has a unique expression as a product of one element from each H_i, in a fixed order. This is precisely the statement that the multiplication map from the external direct product of the H_i to G is bijective (a standard characterization of an internal direct product).

- Conclusion: `∀ i j : Fin n, i ≠ j → ((H i : Set G) ∩ (H j : Set G)) = ({1} : Set G)`:
  For any distinct indices i ≠ j, the set-theoretic intersection of H_i and H_j is exactly the singleton {1}. That is, H_i ∩ H_j = {1}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: if G is the internal direct product of the normal subgroups H_1, ..., H_n, then for any i ≠ j, H_i ∩ H_j = {1}.
- The Lean hypothesis `h_unique` encodes the internal direct product property as the uniqueness of decomposition of every g as an ordered product of elements from the H_i. This is a standard and faithful formalization of “G is the internal direct product of the H_i.”
- The conclusion in Lean exactly matches the desired conclusion: distinct factors have trivial intersection.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The natural language mentions the H_i are normal subgroups. The Lean statement does not assume normality. However, normality is not needed to deduce that H_i ∩ H_j = {1}; the uniqueness of decomposition alone already forces trivial intersections. Thus the Lean code is a slight generalization (weaker assumptions) with the same conclusion. Per the guidelines, this acceptable slight generalization is fine.
- No auxiliary definitions are vacuous; the only nontrivial assumption is `h_unique`, which is substantive and directly encodes the internal direct product property.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an accurate and faithful formalization (slightly more general by omitting unnecessary normality) of the given theorem.

- `theorem phi_injective : Function.Injective (phi : G → G × H) := by sorry`: State that φ is injective.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to show that φ(x) = (x, 1) is an injective homomorphism from G to G × H. The code defines exactly this map and states two theorems: one asserting the homomorphism property (preservation of multiplication) and one asserting injectivity. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the only `sorry`s are in proofs, which is acceptable per the instructions. The codomain uses the standard product group structure, so `*` on G × H is componentwise multiplication, matching the intended meaning.
- There is no mismatch or undue generalization/specialization. Not packaging φ as a `MonoidHom` is acceptable since the statement only requires being a homomorphism, and the property given suffices.

Final check:
- The code precisely captures the intended statement: φ is defined as (x, 1), it preserves multiplication, and it is injective. Thus the two math problems are the same.

- constant GalGroup : Polynomial Rat -> Type u: Introduces an uninterpreted type assigned to each rational polynomial p, called GalGroup p. No connection to Mathlib’s actual Galois group construction.
- constant GalGroup_group : ∀ p : Polynomial Rat, Group (GalGroup p): Postulates that each GalGroup p carries a group structure. Again, no link to the true Galois group.
- theorem complex_roots_expressible_by_radicals_iff_solvable (p : Polynomial Rat) (hp : Irreducible p) : ExpressibleInRadicals p ↔ IsSolvable (GalGroup p) := by sorry: States that for an irreducible polynomial p over Q, ExpressibleInRadicals p is equivalent to IsSolvable (GalGroup p). The proof is omitted (sorry), which is fine for the auditing task, but the statement relies entirely on the uninterpreted placeholders above.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
The natural language statement: For an irreducible polynomial p with rational coefficients, its complex roots are expressible by radicals if and only if its Galois group G is solvable. 

The code mimics the shape of the theorem but uses completely uninterpreted placeholders:
- ExpressibleInRadicals is not defined in terms of radicals or complex roots; it’s an arbitrary predicate.
- GalGroup p is not Mathlib’s Galois group (e.g., of the splitting field of p over Q). It is an arbitrary type assigned to each polynomial with an assumed group structure.
Thus, the code does not actually formalize the intended mathematical notions; it only restates an equivalence between two arbitrary predicates/types.

Step 3: Final check of differences
- The code does not connect ExpressibleInRadicals to “complex roots expressible in radicals.” No reference to Complex, radicals, field extensions, or solvable by radicals.
- The code does not use Mathlib’s notion of a Galois group (e.g., GaloisGroup (SplittingField p) (Rat)) and has no link to the splitting field over Q.
- All key concepts are replaced by opaque constants; hence the statement is vacuous with respect to the intended mathematical meaning.
- While the high-level shape (irreducible p over Q; equivalence between ‘expressible in radicals’ and ‘solvable Galois group’) matches, the formalization is not faithful because it avoids defining the core mathematical objects.

Conclusion: Not faithful. It uses vacuous placeholder constants instead of Mathlib definitions, so it fails the translation criteria.

The natural language statement asks for the addition formulas for sine and cosine to be given (with a conceptual derivation) for all real θ₁, θ₂. The Lean code states exactly these two identities as theorems for all θ₁, θ₂ ∈ ℝ. The universal quantification is captured by the theorem arguments `(θ₁ : ℝ) (θ₂ : ℝ)`. The formulas match precisely.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Same mathematical content: Both the natural language and the Lean code assert the sine and cosine addition formulas for all real inputs.
- Minor note: The natural language requests a conceptual derivation (a proof), while the Lean code provides the statements with `sorry` proofs. Per the auditing instructions, we are checking faithful translation of the statements, not the presence of proofs; no auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. Hence this does not count against faithfulness of translation.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the requested mathematical statements.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- noncomputable def rho_theta (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := fun x => (x.1 * Real.cos θ - x.2 * Real.sin θ, x.1 * Real.sin θ + x.2 * Real.cos θ): Defines the map ρ_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 (with ℝ^2 represented as ℝ × ℝ) by the standard rotation matrix formula (cos θ, −sin θ; sin θ, cos θ). For a vector x = (x₁, x₂), ρ_θ(x) = (x₁ cos θ − x₂ sin θ, x₁ sin θ + x₂ cos θ).
- theorem rho_theta_on_polar (θ r φ : ℝ) : rho_theta θ (r * Real.cos φ, r * Real.sin φ) = (r * Real.cos (φ + θ), r * Real.sin (φ + θ)) := by sorry: States that applying ρ_θ to a vector given in polar coordinates (r cos φ, r sin φ) produces (r cos(φ + θ), r sin(φ + θ)), i.e., it adds θ to the angle while preserving the radius r.
- theorem rho_theta_preserves_norm (θ : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ) : x.1 ^ 2 + x.2 ^ 2 = (rho_theta θ x).1 ^ 2 + (rho_theta θ x).2 ^ 2 := by sorry: States that ρ_θ preserves the Euclidean norm (squared), i.e., the sum of squares is invariant under ρ_θ.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The definition of ρ_θ exactly matches the rotation by angle θ about the origin via the standard 2×2 rotation matrix.
- The theorem rho_theta_on_polar explicitly encodes the defining property of rotation in polar coordinates: angle addition φ ↦ φ + θ with the same radius r. This directly captures “ρ_θ is a rotation of ℝ^2 through θ radians about the origin.”
- The norm preservation theorem further supports the characterization of a rotation (isometry), though it is not strictly necessary.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code uses ℝ × ℝ instead of ℝ^2; this is a standard formalization choice and equivalent.
- The property is stated via polar coordinates rather than an abstract definition of “rotation,” but it is mathematically equivalent to the natural language description. It covers all vectors (including the zero vector when r = 0) and expresses the correct geometric action.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; ρ_θ is genuinely defined. Theorems have sorry proofs, but the task is about faithful translation of statements, not proofs.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the statement that ρ_θ rotates vectors by θ about the origin.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem permutation_representation_to_GL takes: a group G, a natural number n, a field F, and a function δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n).
- It asserts the existence of a function ρ : G → GL (Fin n) F such that for every g : G, the underlying matrix of ρ g has entries given by (ρ g) i j = if δ g j = i then 1 else 0.
- In words: given any function from G to permutations of n elements, there exists a function from G to invertible n×n matrices over F such that each matrix is the permutation matrix associated with the permutation δ g, with 1’s in positions (i,j) where i = δ g j.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Let G be a group, n ∈ ℕ, and F a field. Show that any permutation representation δ: G → S_n gives rise to a matrix representation ρ: G → GL_n(F) by sending g ∈ G to the permutation matrix P_{δ(g)}.”
- Key notions:
  - “permutation representation δ: G → S_n” means δ is a group homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_n.
  - “matrix representation ρ: G → GL_n(F)” means ρ is a group homomorphism into the general linear group.
  - The construction is given by sending g to the permutation matrix corresponding to δ(g).

- What the Lean statement captures correctly:
  - It uses GL (Fin n) F for GL_n(F), which is standard in Mathlib.
  - The matrix entries (ρ g) i j = if δ g j = i then 1 else 0 correctly describe the permutation matrix for δ g (consistent with the usual action on column vectors sending e_j to e_{δ g j}).

- What is missing or weakened in the Lean statement:
  - δ is only a function δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n), not a group homomorphism. The natural language says δ is a permutation representation, i.e., a homomorphism.
  - ρ is only asserted to be a function ρ : G → GL (Fin n) F; there is no assertion that ρ is a group homomorphism. The phrase “matrix representation” in the natural language implies homomorphism.
  - The theorem merely states existence of a function ρ with those matrices, which is true even if δ is not a homomorphism; thus it does not capture the representation property.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The natural language requires that δ be a group homomorphism and that the constructed ρ is a group homomorphism (a representation). The Lean code does not require δ to be a homomorphism and does not assert ρ is a homomorphism. It only constructs a pointwise assignment into GL with the correct permutation matrices. Therefore the translation is not faithful to the intended representation-theoretic statement.

Grade rationale:
- The code has the correct matrix formula and target group, but omits the crucial homomorphism (representation) property for both δ and ρ. This is a significant gap, so it cannot be considered faithful. However, it is not unrelated and captures the concrete matrix construction correctly. Hence a mid-high score but not close to perfect.

- `noncomputable def R2 (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...`: Defines, for each real θ, the 2×2 real rotation matrix R_{2θ} with entries [[cos(2θ), -sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), cos(2θ)]]. Using Real.cos and Real.sin matches the standard rotation matrix.
- `theorem R2_H0_conj (θ : ℝ) : R2 θ * H0 * R2 θ = H0 := by sorry`: States that for all real θ, the matrix product R_{2θ} H0 R_{2θ} equals H0. In Lean, `*` is matrix multiplication and associativity is standard, so this matches the literal expression R2 θ · H0 · R2 θ.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to show R_{2θ} H_0 R_{2θ} = H_0 for all θ ∈ ℝ, with explicit definitions of H_0 and R_{2θ}. The Lean code defines exactly those matrices and states exactly that equality for all real θ.

3) Final check:
- Objects match: H0 is [[1,0],[0,-1]]; R2(θ) is [[cos(2θ), -sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), cos(2θ)]].
- Quantification matches: the theorem is stated for arbitrary θ : ℝ.
- Equality matches: R2 θ * H0 * R2 θ = H0, exactly as in the statement (note it is not the usual conjugation R H0 R^{-1}, but the same as the given problem).
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all definitions are meaningful and standard.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- import Mathlib / open Matrix: Load Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- variable {F : Type*} [Field F], {n : Nat}: Work over a field F and a natural number n.
- def perm_matrix (α : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F := fun i j => if α j = i then 1 else 0: Define, for each permutation α of Fin n, the n×n matrix whose (i,j) entry is 1 exactly when i = α j, and 0 otherwise. This is a standard definition of a permutation matrix (it puts a single 1 in each column at row α j).
- def perm_group_isomorphic_to_perm_matrices : MulEquiv (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (Units (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F)) := by sorry: Claim there is a multiplicative equivalence (group isomorphism) between the symmetric group S_n (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) and the entire group of units in the matrix ring, i.e., GL_n(F). The body is a placeholder (sorry).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: S_n is isomorphic to the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL_n(F), via α ↦ P_α, where P_α is the permutation matrix obtained by applying α to the columns of the identity matrix. So the codomain is the subgroup of GL_n(F) consisting of permutation matrices, not all of GL_n(F).

The Lean statement claims an isomorphism S_n ≃ Units (Matrix …) = GL_n(F). This is strictly stronger and false in general (most units are not permutation matrices). The docstring mentions the subgroup of permutation matrices, but the actual type states an equivalence with the whole units group. There is no definition of the subgroup of permutation matrices nor a restriction to it in the target, and the map α ↦ P_α is not given as a hom into that subgroup. Additionally, the proof is omitted with sorry (acceptable for compilation, but irrelevant to fidelity). The auxiliary definition perm_matrix is legitimate and matches one standard convention.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The code’s main statement asserts S_n ≃ GL_n(F), while the natural language statement asserts S_n ≃ the subgroup of permutation matrices inside GL_n(F). These are different, and the Lean statement is incorrect relative to the intended claim. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Other notes:
- The definition of perm_matrix matches a valid permutation matrix convention (one 1 in each row and column), consistent with the description. The ambiguity about columns vs. rows is harmless here.
- However, the crucial mismatch of the codomain (full units vs. subgroup of permutation matrices) makes the translation fail.

- The domain (ℝ²) and explicit definition of ρ_θ align with the intended meaning of plane rotations.

3) Final check and differences:
- There are no extraneous or vacuous placeholders; `rho` is a legitimate definition. Theorems are universally quantified over real angles, as in the statement.
- While the code states commutativity as a separate theorem rather than deriving it from the sum formula and commutativity of addition, the content is the same.
- Function composition order `(rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2)` corresponds to the conventional product ρ_{θ1}ρ_{θ2} in group notation. No mismatch.

- The natural-language statement: In D_n for n ≥ 3, with r the rotation by 2π/n and h the reflection across the horizontal axis, prove r h r = h using matrices (represent r by the rotation matrix and h by a suitable reflection matrix).
- The Lean code defines r as the standard rotation matrix rot θ and h as the standard reflection ref_h across the x-axis, and asserts rot θ * ref_h * rot θ = ref_h for any angle θ. This directly matches the identity r h r = h in matrix form. It is even a slight generalization, as it holds for all θ, hence in particular for θ = 2π/n.
- The code does not mention D_n or the condition n ≥ 3, but since the argument is via explicit matrices in O(2), this is consistent with the requested “algebraic argument with matrices.” The generalization is acceptable per the guidelines.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope: The Lean theorem holds for every real angle θ, not just θ = 2π/n. This is a benign generalization and implies the desired special case.
- Context: The code does not mention D_n explicitly, but that is unnecessary for the matrix computation the problem requests.
- Wording: The docstring calls R · H · R a “conjugation,” which is a slight misuse (conjugation would be R H R⁻¹), but the formal statement is R H R = H, matching the natural-language target r h r = h.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: rot and ref_h are genuine standard matrices.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully states the intended matrix identity (indeed, in a slightly stronger generality) with legitimate definitions. Thus it is a faithful translation of the natural-language statement.

  Define G as the subset of invertible 4×4 matrices (GL N F) whose underlying matrix (coerced from g) has the 2×2 block upper triangular form with lower-left block zero and whose A,B,C blocks are 2×2 matrices over F, and satisfying det(A*C) ≠ 0.
- theorem G_is_subgroup : Subgroup (GL N F) := by sorry:
  Claim (without proof) the existence of a subgroup of GL N F. Critically, this statement does not mention G at all; it merely asserts that there is some subgroup of GL N F.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: Define G to be all block matrices of the form [[A B],[0 C]] with A,B,C ∈ Mat_{2×2}(F) and det(AC) ≠ 0, and verify that G is a matrix group under multiplication (i.e., a subgroup under matrix multiplication).

Lean code:
- The definition of G captures precisely the set of 4×4 matrices (as elements of GL N F) with the given block form and det(A C) ≠ 0. Using GL N F is fine: det(AC) ≠ 0 implies det A and det C are nonzero, hence the block matrix is invertible, so representing G as a subset of GL N F is faithful.
- However, the theorem G_is_subgroup is wrongly stated: it asserts existence of a Subgroup (GL N F) without any reference to the set G. It does not claim that the subset G forms a subgroup; it could be satisfied by any subgroup (e.g., ⊤). Thus it fails to express “G is a matrix group under multiplication.”

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Main discrepancy: The final theorem does not state that G is a subgroup; it does not mention G at all. Therefore, the Lean code does not formalize the intended verification.
- Minor notes: The unused variable n2 is extraneous. Using GL N F rather than Mat N N F is acceptable given det(AC) ≠ 0 guarantees invertibility. No vacuous placeholders in the definitions; G is a legitimate set. But the key property is not connected to G.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because the crucial subgroup assertion does not involve G.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable (n : ℕ) [NeZero n] (hn : 1 < n)`: Fix a natural number n with n ≠ 0 and n > 1 (the latter implies the former). This corresponds to fixing an integer modulus greater than 1 for modular arithmetic.
- `theorem zmod_int_left_distrib (a b c : Int) : (a : ZMod n) * ((b : ZMod n) + (c : ZMod n)) = (a : ZMod n) * (b : ZMod n) + (a : ZMod n) * (c : ZMod n) := by sorry`: For any integers a, b, c, viewed as elements of Z/nZ (ZMod n), multiplication distributes over addition on the left: [a] * ([b] + [c]) = [a]*[b] + [a]*[c].
- `theorem zmod_int_right_distrib (a b c : Int) : ((b : ZMod n) + (c : ZMod n)) * (a : ZMod n) = (b : ZMod n) * (a : ZMod n) + (c : ZMod n) * (a : ZMod n) := by sorry`: Similarly, right distributivity: ([b] + [c]) * [a] = [b]*[a] + [c]*[a].

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement fixes an integer n > 1 and asks to show left and right distributivity in Z/nZ for all a, b, c ∈ ℤ, where [x] is the congruence class modulo n. The Lean code states precisely these two distributivity equalities in ZMod n, coerces integers a, b, c into ZMod n via `(x : ZMod n)`, and assumes n > 1. This matches the intended meaning.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code takes n as a natural number with `1 < n` (and also assumes `[NeZero n]`), whereas the statement says an integer n > 1. Since ZMod in Mathlib uses a natural modulus and n > 1 implies n ≠ 0, this is a harmless specialization consistent with the problem.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only theorem statements with `sorry` proofs. The statements themselves are exactly the distributive laws in Z/nZ.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n]`: Introduces a type `n` with a `Fintype` instance (so `n` has finitely many elements). This is a common setup to index matrices by a finite type.
- `theorem lean_test (A : Matrix n n ℝ) : True := by trivial`: States and proves a theorem that for any real `n × n` matrix `A`, the proposition `True` holds. The proof is `trivial`, since `True` is always true.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
The original statement concerns an orthogonal matrix `A ∈ O(n)` over `ℝ` and claims that its columns are orthonormal: for column vectors `A_i`, `A_j`, we have `A_i · A_j = δ_{ij}` for all indices `i, j`. This is a substantive property equivalent to `Aᵀ A = I`.

The Lean code does not:
- Mention or assume `A ∈ O(n)` (no orthogonality condition at all).
- Refer to column vectors, dot products, or the Kronecker delta.
- State any nontrivial property; it merely asserts `True` for any matrix `A`.

3) Final check — are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean theorem is completely unrelated and vacuous (it proves `True`), whereas the natural language statement asserts orthonormality of columns of an orthogonal matrix. There is a total mismatch in content and specificity.

  - Here, `n` is an arbitrary finite index type (standing in for the set {1, …, n} in the usual statement). `DecidableEq n` lets us form `if i = j then ... else ...`.
  - `A : Matrix n n Real` is a real n×n matrix.
  - The hypothesis `h : A.transpose * A = 1` encodes the orthogonality condition AᵀA = I (i.e., A ∈ O(n)).
  - The conclusion `(∑ k : n, A k i * A k j) = if i = j then 1 else 0` states that the (i,j)-entry of AᵀA equals δ_ij. Since the (i,j)-entry of AᵀA is exactly `∑ k A k i * A k j`, this is the statement that the dot product of the i-th and j-th columns is the Kronecker delta.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: For A ∈ O(n) with column vectors A₁, …, Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ, show AᵢᵀAⱼ = δᵢⱼ for all i,j. This is exactly the content of AᵀA = I read on the (i,j)-entry. The Lean statement assumes AᵀA = I and concludes that the (i,j)-entry is δᵢⱼ, which is equivalently the inner product of the i-th and j-th columns equals δᵢⱼ.
- The code uses a general finite index type `n` instead of `{1, …, n}`; this is a standard and benign generalization.
- δᵢⱼ is represented as `if i = j then 1 else 0`, the usual encoding of the Kronecker delta.
- Real numbers ℝ are used as in the statement.

Final check: same or different?
- Same mathematical content: orthogonality (AᵀA = I) implies columns are orthonormal, i.e., their inner product is δᵢⱼ.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the hypothesis directly encodes membership in O(n).
- Slight generalization of indexing is acceptable and standard.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

The natural language statement is precisely: O(2) = {R_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} ∪ {H_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}, with R_θ the rotation matrix and H_θ the reflection across the line at angle θ. The Lean code defines R and H exactly as these matrices, defines O2 as the orthogonal group, and asserts the set equality O2 = range R ∪ range H. This is a direct, faithful formalization of the statement.

- O2 is defined via M Mᵀ = I rather than Aᵀ A = I; these are equivalent for square matrices, so no issue.
- R and H have the standard closed-form entries and match the described geometric objects.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `abbrev M := Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ`: We are considering 2×2 real matrices.
- `def O2_set : Set (Units M) := { u | u.val.transpose = (u⁻¹).val }`: Define O(2) as the set of invertible 2×2 real matrices (viewed as `Units M`) whose transpose equals their inverse, i.e., orthogonal matrices.
- `def SO2_set : Set (Units M) := { u | u.val.transpose = (u⁻¹).val ∧ u.val.det = 1 }`: Define SO(2) as those orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.
- The theorem `O2_generated_by_SO2_and_A`: For any fixed `A : Units M` with `Aᵀ = A⁻¹` (orthogonal) and `det A = -1` (improper), we have `Subgroup.closure (SO2_set ∪ {A}) = Subgroup.closure O2_set`.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For any fixed improper orthogonal A in O(2) \ SO(2), O(2) is generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}.
- The Lean statement asserts that the subgroup generated by `SO2_set ∪ {A}` equals the subgroup generated by `O2_set` inside the group `Units M` of invertible 2×2 real matrices. Since `O2_set` is (mathematically) a subgroup (orthogonality is preserved under multiplication, contains the identity, and is closed under inverses), `Subgroup.closure O2_set` is exactly O(2) as a subgroup. Thus the equality of closures matches the claim that O(2) is generated by SO(2) together with A.
- The hypotheses on `A` (orthogonal and det = -1) exactly encode “improper orthogonal.” The ambient group is `Units M`, which is standard for matrix groups and faithful to GL₂(ℝ); this is an acceptable formalization.
- There are no vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful and standard. The theorem is universally quantified over A with the required properties via parameters `A`, `hA_orth`, and `hA_improper`.

Final check: The mathematical meaning of the Lean theorem matches the natural language statement. The use of `Subgroup.closure` on the RHS (instead of naming `O(2)` as a subgroup object) is the standard way to express “generated by” in Lean when starting from sets, and is fully faithful given that `O2_set` is indeed a subgroup mathematically.

- import Mathlib: Load Mathlib.
- Comments state this is an informal translation using placeholders and a theorem with sorry.
- axiom AlternatingGroupType : ℕ → Type; axiom AlternatingGroup_group : ∀ n, Group (AlternatingGroupType n): Introduce a family of opaque types indexed by n, each equipped (axiomatically) with a Group instance. These are placeholders, not Mathlib's actual alternating groups Alt n.
- axiom LieTypeGroup : String → Type; axiom LieTypeGroup_group : ∀ s, Group (LieTypeGroup s): Introduce an opaque family of types indexed by a String label with Group instances, meant to represent simple groups of Lie type. Pure placeholders.
- axiom SporadicGroup : Fin 26 → Type; axiom SporadicGroup_group : ∀ i, Group (SporadicGroup i): Introduce 26 opaque types with Group instances, intended to represent the sporadic groups. Again placeholders.
- inductive SimpleGroupFamily (G) [Group G] : Prop with constructors:
  • cyclic_prime (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (e : G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p)):
    Claims G is multiplicatively isomorphic to Multiplicative (ZMod p). This is intended to mean G is a cyclic group of order p, but it uses the multiplicative structure of ZMod p (ring multiplication), not the additive cyclic group of order p.
  • alternating (n ≥ 5) (e : G ≃* AlternatingGroupType n): Claims G is isomorphic (as a multiplicative group) to the placeholder alternating type at degree n ≥ 5.
  • lie_type (label : String) (e : G ≃* LieTypeGroup label): Claims G is isomorphic to one of the placeholder Lie-type groups.
  • sporadic (i : Fin 26) (e : G ≃* SporadicGroup i): Claims G is isomorphic to one of the 26 placeholder sporadic groups.
- theorem classification_of_finite_simple_groups {G} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : IsSimpleGroup G) : SimpleGroupFamily G := by sorry:
  States the classification as: every finite simple group G falls into one of the four families above, with proof omitted.

Step 2: Faithfulness assessment
- The natural language statement is the Classification of Finite Simple Groups: every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of: (1) cyclic of prime order; (2) alternating of degree ≥ 5; (3)-(5) simple groups of Lie type (classical, exceptional, twisted, including Tits); (6) one of the 26 sporadic groups.
- The code tries to mirror this by defining a Prop-valued inductive predicate indicating membership in one of these families via a group isomorphism.
- Major issues:
  1) Cyclic case is incorrectly modeled as G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p). The group of order p is the additive group of ZMod p (or any cyclic group of cardinality p). Multiplicative (ZMod p) uses ZMod p's ring multiplication, which is not a group (zero has no inverse). So this target is wrong conceptually, and in fact there cannot be such a MulEquiv from a group to a monoid with a zero element. This misrepresents “cyclic of prime order”.
  2) Alternating/Lie-type/Sporadic are opaque axiomatically-introduced types with Group instances. They are not identified with Mathlib's actual alternating group Alt n, nor with any formal construction of Lie type or sporadics. They are placeholders, so the statement does not faithfully use standard Mathlib concepts, and there is no guarantee they represent the intended families. This is a red flag per the guidelines.
  3) The Lie-type case does not enforce “simple” in the target family. The natural language says “a simple group of Lie type”; the code provides a generic LieTypeGroup label without any property of simplicity. While the overall theorem assumes G is simple and claims an isomorphism to some Lie-type placeholder, the target family being explicitly simple is part of the statement’s content and is not encoded.
  4) The classification in the statement lists classical vs exceptional/twisted (and mentions Tits) as subfamilies; the code collapses these into a single “LieTypeGroup label : String”. That coarsening could be acceptable in a faithful formalization, but here it is compounded with the placeholder nature and lack of properties.

Step 3: Final comparison
- Same core quantification: “Every finite simple group” ↔ [Fintype G] and IsSimpleGroup G. OK.
- Outcome: “is isomorphic to one of the following” ↔ existence of a constructor giving a group isomorphism to one of the family types. Structurally similar.
- Differences:
  • Cyclic case is wrong: uses multiplicative structure on ZMod p instead of the additive cyclic group of order p. This is a substantive mismatch.
  • Alternating/Lie-type/Sporadic families are introduced as opaque axioms rather than Mathlib’s actual definitions, so the translation is not legitimate or faithful to standard objects.
  • The Lie-type target is not constrained to be simple.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. It relies on ad hoc axiomatic placeholders and misrepresents the cyclic case. Even if the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib concepts, the cyclic case would still need correction. Therefore, it fails the faithfulness criteria.

- Comment: ""Basic properties of congruence modulo n for integers."" Matches the topic.
- `theorem int_modeq_refl (n a : Int) : a ≡ a [ZMOD n] := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any integers n and a, a is congruent to a modulo n. This states reflexivity of congruence mod n.
- `theorem int_modeq_symm {n a b : Int} (h : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) : b ≡ a [ZMOD n] := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any integers n, a, b, if a ≡ b (mod n), then b ≡ a (mod n). This states symmetry.
- `theorem int_modeq_trans {n a b c : Int} (hab : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) (hbc : b ≡ c [ZMOD n]) : a ≡ c [ZMOD n] := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any integers n, a, b, c, if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n). This states transitivity.

Assessment versus the original statement:
- Original: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c ∈ Z. Prove reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of congruence modulo n.
- Lean: States the same three properties for integers a, b, c, and an integer n, using the standard Mathlib notation `a ≡ b [ZMOD n]` for congruence modulo n on integers.

Differences:
- The Lean code does not assume n is positive; it allows any integer n (including 0 or negative). This is a slight generalization and is acceptable by the guidelines, as the properties remain true and include the positive case.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; all statements are standard and use Mathlib’s established notation.
- Proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is allowed for our auditing purpose focusing on statement faithfulness.

Conclusion:
- The Lean code faithfully formalizes the three stated properties of congruence modulo n for integers, with a benign generalization on n. It matches the mathematical meaning of the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- `noncomputable def GLn (n : Nat) : Type := Units (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real)`: Defines GLn(n) as the unit group of n×n real matrices, i.e., GL_n(ℝ). This matches the usual general linear group over ℝ.
- `def det_units {n : Nat} (g : GLn n) : Real := (g.val).det`: Defines a function taking an element g of GLn(n) to its determinant in ℝ (not in ℝˣ). This is the determinant of the underlying matrix `g.val`.
- `theorem conjugation_preserves_det (n : Nat) (g h : GLn n) (h_det1 : det_units h = 1) : det_units (g * h * g⁻¹) = 1 := by sorry`: States that if h has determinant 1, then any conjugate g h g⁻¹ also has determinant 1. This is the typical property used to show normality of SL(n) in GL(n), but here it is stated only as a lemma about determinants, with no explicit definition of SL(n) or a normal subgroup structure. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
- `theorem GLn_quot_SLn_iso_Runits (n : Nat) : True := by sorry`: States the proposition `True` (a vacuous statement) and leaves it unproven (`sorry`). The comment suggests the intended content: that the determinant homomorphism GLn →* Realˣ has kernel SL(n), inducing GL/SL ≃ Realˣ. However, the actual Lean statement is just `True`, not the intended isomorphism statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show: (i) SL(n) is normal in GL(n), and (ii) GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝˣ. 
- The code never defines `SLn` as a subgroup, nor does it assert its normality in GLn. The lemma `conjugation_preserves_det` is relevant to proving normality, but it is not tied to an actual subgroup or a statement that SLn is normal. Moreover, it is left as `sorry` (though we do not judge proofs, we do judge the statement).
- The quotient/isomorphism part is not stated at all: the theorem `GLn_quot_SLn_iso_Runits` asserts `True` instead of the isomorphism `GLn n ⧸ SLn n ≃* Realˣ` (or a closely matching formulation). This is a vacuous placeholder and does not express the desired statement.
- Additionally, the determinant map is defined into `Real`, not `Realˣ`, which would be the correct codomain for a multiplicative group homomorphism leading to the quotient isomorphism.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code does not define SL(n), does not state or prove its normality, and does not state the quotient isomorphism. The main theorem is replaced by a vacuous `True`. Thus the formal statement is not the same as the natural language statement.

Differences found:
- Missing definition of SL(n) as a subgroup of GL(n).
- Missing explicit normal subgroup statement SL(n) ◁ GL(n).
- The purported isomorphism is replaced by a vacuous statement `True` and not formulated in Lean.
- The determinant map is to ℝ rather than to ℝˣ (Units ℝ), which is necessary for a group homomorphism and kernel description.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the mathematical library, providing complex numbers and related notions.
- `open Complex` opens the Complex namespace, giving access to `I` for the imaginary unit and `star` for complex conjugation.
- The docstring describes the polarization identity for complex numbers in Lean notation, using `star` for conjugation and products to represent squared norms.
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) : ... := by sorry` states a theorem for all complex numbers `z, w`. The statement is:
  4 * z * star w = (z + w) * star (z + w) - (z - w) * star (z - w) + I * ((z + I * w) * star (z + I * w) - (z - I * w) * star (z - I * w))
  Interpreting: `star` is complex conjugation, so `(a) * star (a)` is |a|^2. `I` is the imaginary unit i in ℂ. Thus the right-hand side is exactly |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2). The left-hand side `4 * z * star w` is 4 z \bar w.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: Prove the polarization identity 4 z\bar{w} = |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2).
- The Lean statement matches exactly, with |·|^2 represented as `a * star a`, conjugation as `star`, and i as `I`. The variables are complex numbers `z w : ℂ`. No extra assumptions or restrictions are added.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation fidelity.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. No discrepancies in constants, signs, or terms. The use of `* star` for squared modulus is standard in complex numbers.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines are setup and do not affect the statement.
- The docstring states the intended math: if f: ℂ → ℂ satisfies f(z+w) = f(z) f(w) and f(0) = 1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. It also mentions the exponential function as a particular case.

  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary function f: ℂ → ℂ. Hypothesis `h` is exactly the Cauchy-type functional equation f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) for all z,w. Hypothesis `hf` is f(0)=1. The conclusion, for an arbitrary z: ℂ, is `f z ≠ 0`. The proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable per the task instructions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement has two parts: (i) use e^{z+w}=e^z e^w and e^0=1≠0 to show e^z≠0 for all z ∈ ℂ; (ii) equivalently, prove the general lemma: if f satisfies f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1, then f(z)≠0 for all z. The Lean theorem states exactly the general lemma (ii). The particular case for the exponential follows immediately from known identities in Mathlib (exp_add and exp_zero).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain and codomain are ℂ→ℂ, matching the statement on complex numbers.
- The functional equation and normalization at 0 are exactly as stated.
- The conclusion is exactly nonvanishing for all z.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement.
- The code does not explicitly state the corollary about exp, but the problem itself says “In other words” and asks for the general lemma, so this is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

The code defines exactly that matrix M = [[a, -b], [b, a]] and the vectors [1; -i] and [1; i], and asserts the two eigen-equations M v1 = (a + i b) v1 and M v2 = (a − i b) v2. This matches the correspondence [1; ∓ i] with eigenvalues a ± i b.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; M, v1, v2 are concrete. The theorem states the eigen-relations directly, which is an accepted formalization of “has eigenvalues with corresponding eigenvectors.”
- Minor technical note: The matrix entries are in ℂ (with real values a,b). The standard representation is often as a real matrix, but using complex scalars here is a harmless slight generalization; the statement about eigenpairs remains exactly the same. This does not change the mathematical meaning with respect to the claim.

The intention is to endow G' with a group structure under matrix multiplication. However, the entire instance is filled with `sorry`, i.e., a placeholder for the data and proofs (multiplication, identity, inverses, and axioms), so no actual content is provided.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The definitions φ, G, and G' exactly capture the sets in the natural language statement.
- The final goal in the natural language is: ""Prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication."" In Lean, giving a `Group` instance on the subtype {M // M ∈ G'} is an appropriate way to express this. However, the instance is provided via `by sorry`, which is a vacuous placeholder. According to the guidelines, using `sorry` for the crucial construction/proof means the translation fails as it does not legitimately establish the group structure or even specify that the multiplication used is the inherited matrix multiplication.

3) Final comparison:
- Mathematical problems intended: identical (show G' is a group under matrix multiplication).
- Lean formalization: intended to assert exactly that via a Group instance on the subtype, but it does not actually construct it (uses `sorry`). Hence the translation is not legitimate/faithful per the rules.
- No other auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; only the final instance is vacuous. If this were filled in correctly using the inherited matrix multiplication and showing closure, identity, inverses, and associativity, it would be faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the subsequent `open` lines just bring in Mathlib and some namespaces; they don’t affect the mathematical content.
- The docstring states the goal: For a holomorphic f : ℂ → ℂ, f is conformal at z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.
- The theorem statement: `theorem conformal_at_iff_deriv_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z₀ : ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀) : ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ deriv f z₀ ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  This says: For a complex function f and a point z₀, assuming f is complex-differentiable at z₀ (i.e., holomorphic at z₀), f is conformal at z₀ if and only if the complex derivative deriv f z₀ is nonzero.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: “Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 if and only if f'(z0) ≠ 0.”
- The code assumes `DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀`, which is the local (at z₀) holomorphic assumption, exactly what is needed for the equivalence. The statement concludes `ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ deriv f z₀ ≠ 0`, which matches “conformal at z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.” Here `deriv` is the complex derivative f′ at z₀. `ConformalAt` is Mathlib’s conformality predicate at a point for maps ℂ → ℂ (viewed as real inner product spaces), so the target predicate is correct.

3) Comparing the two statements:
- The natural language says “Suppose f is holomorphic” (globally) but only uses the property at a specific point z0 in the equivalence. The Lean code requires only `DifferentiableAt` at z₀, which is a standard and slightly weaker hypothesis, but fully faithful to the intended local statement. This is a slight generalization, which is acceptable and does not change the mathematical content of the claim.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms (`ConformalAt`, `DifferentiableAt`, `deriv`) are standard Mathlib constructs.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (even a slightly sharper one) of the natural language claim.

This is exactly the conjugation-invariance condition of N under G, i.e., normality in G, provided N is a subgroup (which is separately asserted) and N ⊆ G (which holds from the defining equations).

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- The natural language G is “the set of all real 2×2 matrices of the form [[a, b], [0, c]]” considered as a subgroup of GL(2). The Lean code defines G_set as invertible matrices with lower-left entry 0, i.e. upper triangular. This matches the intended G inside GL(2). The restriction to Units A encodes the GL(2) condition. No extra constraints are missing: in 2×2, “upper triangular” is exactly the lower-left entry being 0.
- The natural language N is “the set of all matrices [[1, b], [0, 1]]”. The Lean N_set imposes exactly this shape and lives in Units A; all such matrices are invertible, so the Units restriction is consistent.
- The statement requires: (i) G is a subgroup of GL(2). Lean: exists_subgroup_G achieves precisely that. (ii) N is a subgroup. Lean: exists_subgroup_N. (iii) N is normal in G. Lean: N_normal_in_G states closure of N under conjugation by g with g ∈ G_set. Since N_set ⊆ G_set (immediate from definitions), and N_set is a subgroup (exists_subgroup_N), this expresses normality.

3) Final check for differences:
- Using Units A instead of an explicit GL(2) type is a standard and faithful way to formalize GL(2, ℝ). No issue.
- G_set is defined by the property “lower-left entry = 0” within Units, which exactly matches upper-triangular invertible matrices. The natural language also implicitly restricts to invertibles when calling it a subgroup of GL(2).
- Normality is expressed via the conjugation condition for all g in G_set; this is equivalent to N ◃ G when N is a subgroup and N ⊆ G, both of which hold from the other statements/definitions.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. All auxiliary definitions are meaningful Mathlib objects.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: For every z ∈ U, there exists a set V such that IsOpen V, z ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f is injective on V (formulated as ∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic; f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U; conclude: f is locally injective on U, i.e., for each z₀ ∈ U there exists a neighborhood V of z₀ such that the restriction f|_V is injective.
- Lean: Requires U open; f is complex differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U) with nonvanishing derivative on U; concludes existence of an open neighborhood V of each z in U, contained in U, on which f is injective. This is exactly the local injectivity statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: Natural language has f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability only on U. Since U is open, this is a standard and faithful reformulation; no change in meaning regarding differentiability and derivative on U.
- Neighborhood description: Lean requires V to be open in ℂ and contained in U, which is a slightly stronger formulation than merely open in the subspace topology of U, but still faithful to the usual notion of a neighborhood in ℂ and to the intended claim.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:

2) Whole translation fidelity:
The natural language statement says: For each θ ∈ ℝ, H_θ = H₀ R_{−2θ}, where H₀ = [[1,0],[0,−1]] and R_φ = [[cos φ, −sin φ],[sin φ, cos φ]]. The Lean code defines H₀ and R exactly as specified and defines H(θ) to be H₀ * R(−2θ). The theorem then restates precisely that equality. Thus it is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Matrices H₀ and R_φ match the given explicit forms.
- The relation H_θ = H₀ R_{−2θ} is exactly encoded as the definition of H and restated as a theorem for each θ.
- No extraneous or vacuous placeholders are used; all definitions are concrete. The use of Fin 2 indexing with i=0/1 corresponds correctly to rows/columns 0 and 1.
- The presence of a sorry in the theorem proof is acceptable for translation auditing, as the statement aligns perfectly and the equality is definitional.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `noncomputable def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix R(θ) with entries cos θ, −sin θ, sin θ, cos θ, i.e., the standard rotation matrix.
- `theorem det_R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix.det (R θ) = 1 := by sorry` states that the determinant of R(θ) is 1 for each real θ.
- `theorem orthonormal_R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix.transpose (R θ) * R θ = 1 := by sorry` states that R(θ) is orthogonal, i.e., its transpose times itself equals the identity matrix.
- `theorem R_mem_SO2 (θ : ℝ) : (Matrix.det (R θ) = 1) /\ (Matrix.transpose (R θ) * R θ = 1) := by sorry` bundles the two defining properties (det = 1 and orthogonality) into a single statement for each θ. This is precisely the usual definition of being in SO(2), even though it is phrased as a conjunction rather than an explicit membership in a dedicated SO(2) type.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show R_θ ∈ SO(2) for all θ ∈ ℝ. In mathematics, SO(2) consists exactly of the 2×2 real orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. The Lean code asserts (for arbitrary θ) that det(R θ) = 1 and R(θ)ᵀ R(θ) = I, which are precisely those defining properties. Thus it captures the intended statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code does not explicitly use a Mathlib type or set named SO(2); instead, it states the two defining properties directly. This is an equivalent formulation and is a standard way to assert membership when a named structure is not referenced. There are no vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable under the instruction that no proofs are required for the translation task.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful to the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex Set` and `open scoped Topology`: Setup imports and namespaces.
- Docstring: States the intended meaning: if f is holomorphic (complex-differentiable) on an open set U, then f is analytic on U.
- The theorem `analyticOn_of_differentiableOn {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) : AnalyticOn ℂ f U` asserts: Given any set U in ℂ and f : ℂ → ℂ, if f is complex differentiable on U (in the sense of mathlib’s `DifferentiableOn ℂ`), then f is analytic on U (in the sense of `AnalyticOn ℂ`). No assumptions of openness or connectedness are included in the theorem statement.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement has three components:
  (a) If f is holomorphic on a domain U (open and connected), then f is analytic.
  (b) For any z₀ ∈ U, f has a Taylor series converging in the disk |z − z₀| < R, where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞).
  (c) The sum of the series equals f.
- The Lean theorem captures only (a) (modulo the fact it does not require U to be open or connected) and (c) implicitly, since `AnalyticOn` entails local power series expansions whose sum equals f in a neighborhood.
- Crucially, the Lean statement says nothing about the radius of convergence being the distance to the nearest singularity; it only asserts analyticity (existence of a local power series), not the characterization of the radius of convergence. Also, it does not require U to be a domain (no openness/connectedness hypothesis).

3) Final comparison:
- Same: The core assertion “holomorphic implies analytic” is represented (DifferentiableOn → AnalyticOn).
- Different:
  - The Lean code omits the domain (open and connected) assumption.
  - The Lean code does not include the radius-of-convergence characterization (“R is the distance to the nearest singularity”). This is a substantial part of the original statement and is not encoded by `AnalyticOn`.
- Therefore, the code is a strict weakening of the natural language statement and does not faithfully translate the full claim.

Given there are no vacuous definitions and the main first sentence is captured, but a major part (radius equals distance to nearest singularity) is missing and domain assumptions are loosened, the translation is not faithful overall.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem eq_const_of_isLocalMax_norm has parameters:
  - f : ℂ → ℂ, a complex-valued function defined on all of ℂ (global function).
  - U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U (U is open).
  - z0 : ℂ with hU0 : z0 ∈ U.
  - hf : ∀ z, z ∈ U → DifferentiableAt ℂ f z (f is complex-differentiable at every point of U; i.e., holomorphic on U). 
  - hfm : IsLocalMax (norm ∘ f) z0 (|f| has a local maximum at z0 in the ambient space ℂ, i.e., there is a neighborhood in ℂ — not restricted to U — on which |f| ≤ |f z0|).
- Conclusion: ∀ᶠ z in 𝓝 z0, f z = f z0, i.e., there exists a neighborhood (in the ambient ℂ) of z0 on which f is identically equal to the constant f z0.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: f : U → ℂ is holomorphic on the open set U ⊂ ℂ; |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U (interpreted relative to U); conclusion: f is constant in a neighborhood of z0 (within U).
- Lean code differences:
  1) Domain of f: The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ, not f : U → ℂ. It then imposes differentiability only on U. This is acceptable as a common formalization trick, but it alters the ambient context.
  2) Local maximum: The Lean hypothesis IsLocalMax (norm ∘ f) z0 is an ambient local maximum in ℂ, not a local maximum relative to U. The original statement only requires a local maximum when restricting to the open set U. This makes the Lean hypothesis strictly stronger than the original statement.
  3) Conclusion: The Lean conclusion states f is constant on some neighborhood in ℂ (eventually at z0), which is stronger than “constant on a neighborhood within U.” The original claims constancy in some neighborhood contained in U. The Lean conclusion implies the original one (by intersecting with U), but it is stronger and not a faithful restatement.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. However, the mismatch on the locality (relative to U vs ambient ℂ) in both the hypothesis and the conclusion means the code is not a faithful translation. It strengthens the statement in a nontrivial way.

Final check: The two math problems are different. The Lean version assumes and concludes ambient (ℂ) locality, while the natural language version is relative to U. Therefore, not faithful.

- `(hHK : H ≤ K)`: Assumption H ⊆ K.
- `(Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk' H) K).Normal`: The image of K under the quotient map G → G/H (i.e., K/H seen as a subgroup of G/H) is normal in G/H. This matches “(K/H) ◁ (G/H)”. Using `Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk' H) K` is the standard way to realize K/H inside G/H.
- `(QuotientGroup.quotient (G ⧸ H) (Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk' H) K)) ≃* (G ⧸ K)`: The quotient of G/H by K/H is (multiplicatively) isomorphic to G/K. Here `≃*` is a group isomorphism. The left-hand side represents (G/H)/(K/H), using the subgroup `Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk' H) K` of G/H.

Faithfulness assessment:
- Hypotheses exactly encode H, K normal in G and H ⊆ K.
- First conclusion states K/H is normal in G/H.
- Second conclusion states a group isomorphism (G/H)/(K/H) ≃ G/K.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions (Subgroup.map, QuotientGroup.mk', quotients, and group isomorphism `≃*`). The representation of K/H inside G/H via the image under the quotient map is the standard formalization and matches the intended meaning when H ≤ K.

Potential technical nuances (not impacting faithfulness):
- Normality is provided as explicit hypotheses rather than typeclass instances; this is a common and acceptable way to state the theorem.
- Writing the nested quotient via `Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk' H) K` is the standard way to view K/H as a subgroup of G/H.

Final check: The formal statement matches the natural language statement in mathematical content. Both parts of the third isomorphism theorem are present and correctly formulated.

  - h_maps : MapsTo f (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1) (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1): for every z with |z| < 1, we have |f z| < 1; i.e., f maps the open unit disk into itself.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Suppose f : D → D is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1, where D is the unit disk.
- Correspondence:
  - D is the open unit disk; Lean uses Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1, which is the open unit disk.
  - f : D → D is captured by MapsTo f (ball) (ball), i.e., f maps the disk to itself. Lean takes f as a global function ℂ → ℂ, but only assumes holomorphic on the disk and the mapping property on the disk; this is a standard and harmless generalization of the domain of definition.
  - Holomorphic on D is exactly DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1) (the disk is open so this implies differentiability at 0).
  - f(0) = 0 is included.
  - |f'(0)| ≤ 1 matches ‖deriv f 0‖ ≤ 1, as the complex norm equals the absolute value.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement precisely encodes the Schwarz lemma consequence stated: a holomorphic self-map of the unit disk fixing 0 has derivative at 0 with modulus ≤ 1. The only difference is that the Lean function is defined on all of ℂ, but with holomorphy and mapping properties restricted to the unit disk; this is a benign generalization and does not change the content of the theorem.

No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The translation is faithful.

  • The 1-st coordinate of rho_θ(v) is sin θ · v 0 + cos θ · v 1.
  This is exactly applying the 2×2 rotation matrix [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]] to the vector (v 0, v 1), i.e., the standard plane rotation by θ.

The proof is omitted (sorry), but for the purposes of translation auditing, only the statement matters.

2) Fidelity to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show: For any θ ∈ ℝ and any nonzero X ∈ ℝ^2, the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ (hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ).
- The Lean definition rho matches the usual rotation by θ in ℝ^2.
- The theorem states exactly that for any θ and nonzero x, the angle between x and rho θ x equals θ, using Mathlib's standard angle notion.
- The nonzero hypothesis on x matches the English statement's “nonzero X”.
- The type ℝ^2 is faithfully modeled as EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) with the standard inner product.
Thus, the Lean statement is a direct formalization of the given English statement.

Note: In Mathlib, InnerProductGeometry.angle takes values in [0, π]. The English wording “angle between” typically also refers to the unsigned angle in [0, π]. Both the English and Lean statements quantify over all real θ; as written, both assert equality to θ without restricting θ to [0, π]. This is a mathematical subtlety about truth, but from a translation standpoint, the Lean code mirrors the English claim exactly.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Objects: ℝ^2, θ ∈ ℝ, nonzero vector x: match.
- Map ρ_θ: correct rotation matrix: match.
- Conclusion: angle between x and ρ_θ(x) equals θ: match.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: rho is concrete, and the theorem uses the standard angle from Mathlib. The presence of “sorry” affects provability, not the faithfulness of the statement.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- The theorem `perm_conj_swap {α : Type _} [DecidableEq α] (σ : Perm α) (a b : α) : (σ.trans (swap a b)).trans σ.symm = swap (σ a) (σ b)` states: For any type α with decidable equality, any permutation σ on α, and any elements a, b in α, conjugating the transposition (swap a b) by σ yields the transposition swapping σ a and σ b. In standard group notation: σ ∘ (a b) ∘ σ⁻¹ = (σ a, σ b). The proof is omitted with `sorry` (but our task concerns the statement, not the proof).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement is specific to Sym_n with α = (1,2), β = (1,2,...,n), and asserts for 1 < i < n that (i,i+1) = β^{i-1} α β^{-(i-1)} = β^{i-1} α β^{n-i+1}.
- The Lean theorem is a general identity about conjugation of a transposition: σ (a b) σ⁻¹ = (σ a σ b). This is a standard fact and is indeed the conceptual core used to deduce (i, i+1) by taking σ = β^{i-1}, a = 1, b = 2, provided β is the cycle (1 2 … n), because then σ(1) = i and σ(2) = i+1, so the RHS becomes (i, i+1).
- However, the Lean code does not define or mention Sym_n, the particular permutations α and β, nor the power relation β^{-(i-1)} = β^{n-i+1} (which uses that β has order n). Thus the code captures only a general conjugation lemma, not the full stated equality, and omits the second equality involving β^{n-i+1}.

3) Final comparison:
- Same core idea? Yes: the conjugation behavior of transpositions is exactly what one uses to show β^{i-1} (1 2) β^{-(i-1)} = (i, i+1).
- But the code does not state the specific result for α, β, and i in Sym_n, nor the equality with β^{n-i+1}. It is a general lemma that would be a key step in a proof, not a faithful translation of the specific statement to be proved.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is related and a useful generalization, but it does not fully or directly formalize the given natural language statement.

Given the guidelines, there are no vacuous placeholders, and the lemma is legitimate. However, it misses the specific instantiation and the second equality, so it is not a faithful translation.

  Natural language: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, we have |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|). Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus, and `Complex.log` is the principal branch of the complex logarithm (Mathlib defines it as a total function, with the usual branch cut; the statement itself doesn't hinge on domain issues). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The theorem statement exactly matches the natural language claim: the hypothesis is |z| < 1 over ℂ and the conclusion is the stated inequality involving the modulus of the complex logarithm and the rational function of |z|. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain and objects: Both are over ℂ; the same hypothesis |z| < 1. 
- Conclusion: Identical inequality using the complex modulus and the principal log. 
- No extra assumptions or weakenings. The use of `Complex.abs` and `Complex.log` matches the intended meanings.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `exists_mem_ball_norm_lt_of_norm_ne_zero` with parameters:
  - ε : ℝ, z₀ : ℂ, p : ℂ → ℂ.
  - Assumptions: `hp : p ≠ 0` (p is not the zero function), `hε : 0 < ε`, and `hpz₀ : p z₀ ≠ 0`.
  - Conclusion: there exists w in the open ball `Metric.ball z₀ ε` (i.e., |w - z₀| < ε) such that ‖p w‖ < ‖p z₀‖.

Assessment of alignment with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement requires p to be a nonconstant complex polynomial, or more generally a nonconstant power series converging in the ball {|z - z₀| < ε}. It also assumes p(z₀) ≠ 0.
- The Lean code:
  - Treats p as an arbitrary function ℂ → ℂ with no regularity/analyticity constraints (not restricted to polynomials or power series).
  - Uses `p ≠ 0` meaning p is not the zero function, which is strictly weaker than “nonconstant.” It allows constant nonzero functions. This is a critical mismatch: for a constant nonzero function, the conclusion is false, whereas the natural statement explicitly excludes constants.
  - Omits any hypothesis about convergence of a power series on the ball or analyticity.

Whole translation faithfulness:
- The conclusion form (existence of w in the ball with |p(w)| < |p(z₀)|) matches.
- The hypotheses do not match: the code vastly generalizes (and in fact changes) the class of functions from nonconstant analytic (polynomial/power series) to arbitrary nonzero functions, and replaces “nonconstant” with “not identically zero,” which is not equivalent.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Final check — same or different math problem?:
- Different. The code asserts a statement for arbitrary functions (with p ≠ 0 and p(z₀) ≠ 0), not for nonconstant polynomials or convergent power series. It also weakens “nonconstant” to “not identically zero.” These changes are substantial and make the formal statement not faithful to the original.

Additional notes:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is `sorry`, which would be acceptable if the statement matched, but it does not.

- The lemma declaration: `lemma abs_csc_le_abs_csc_re_tac_1304 (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.csc z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.csc ↑z.re) := by sorry`
  In words: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of csc z is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of csc of the real part of z (with the real part coerced to ℂ). The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|.
- Lean: Exactly the same, with explicit use of Complex.abs for |·| and Complex.csc, and coercion of Re z to ℂ. This matches the intended meaning. The absolute value on the RHS in natural language is the real absolute value, but in Lean it is expressed as Complex.abs of the complex-valued csc applied to a real argument. Since csc(Re z) is real (as a value of the complex csc on a real input), Complex.abs equals the real absolute value, so this is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single lemma statement is given.
- The inequality direction and functions match exactly: |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|.
- Minor technical detail: the RHS uses Complex.abs rather than Real.abs, but because the input is real, this is equivalent and standard in formalizations. Thus the two problems are the same.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the subsequent `open`/`open scoped` lines: bring in Mathlib and various namespaces; no mathematical content change.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U)`: U is an open subset of the complex plane.
  - `{f : ℂ → ℂ}`: f is a function defined on all of ℂ (not just U).
  - `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is (complex) differentiable on U; i.e., holomorphic on U.
  - `(hf_inj : Injective f)`: f is injective as a function ℂ → ℂ, i.e., globally injective.
  - Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`: for every z in U, the (complex) derivative of f at z is nonzero.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic and injective (injective on U); then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean statement matches holomorphic on U via `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, and the conclusion matches the nonvanishing derivative for all z ∈ U using `deriv f z ≠ 0`.
- The main discrepancy: in Lean, f is defined on all of ℂ and is assumed injective on all of ℂ (`Injective f`), whereas the natural statement only assumes f is defined on U and injective on U. Thus, the Lean version imposes a stronger hypothesis than necessary.
- Using `deriv f z` for a function defined on ℂ is appropriate and coincides with the usual complex derivative on U because U is open and `DifferentiableOn` on an open set implies differentiable at each point in U.

3) Final check: are they the same problem?
- They are essentially the same conclusion and holomorphicity assumption, but the Lean version is a slight specialization/strengthening: it requires global injectivity instead of injectivity restricted to U. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used, and the Mathlib notions are standard. This is a minor discrepancy and acceptable as a faithful formalization with a slightly stronger assumption.

Grade rationale: The translation is accurate except for the stronger injectivity hypothesis. Everything else aligns well with standard Mathlib formulations. Hence, it's nearly perfect but not exact → grade 9.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Brings in Mathlib and opens the Matrix namespace.

- def O_group (n : Nat) := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real // Matrix.transpose A * A = 1}: Defines O(n) as the subtype of real n×n matrices satisfying Aᵀ A = I (orthogonal matrices). This is the standard matrix-level definition of the real orthogonal group.

- def SO_group (n : Nat) := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real // Matrix.transpose A * A = 1 ∧ Matrix.det A = 1}: Defines SO(n) as those orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. Again, the standard definition.

- theorem SO_normal_in_O (n) (g : O_group n) (h : SO_group n) : ∃ k : SO_group n, k.1 = g.1 * h.1 * Matrix.transpose g.1: For any orthogonal matrix g and any special orthogonal matrix h, there exists a special orthogonal matrix k whose underlying matrix equals g h gᵀ. Because for orthogonal g we have gᵀ = g⁻¹, this is exactly the statement “conjugation by g sends h into SO(n)”. Expressed via existence of a term of the subtype equal to the conjugate, this is the appropriate Lean way to say the conjugate lies in SO(n). This captures the normality condition (closure under conjugation) at the matrix level.

- theorem exists_det_sign_surj_ker (n) : ∃ det_sign : O_group n → Units Int, Function.Surjective det_sign ∧ (∀ g, det_sign g = 1 ↔ Matrix.det g.1 = 1): Asserts existence of a surjective map from O(n) to the multiplicative units of ℤ (i.e. {±1}) such that the preimage of 1 exactly coincides with those orthogonal matrices of determinant 1. This characterizes the kernel as SO(n) (since an element of O_group with det = 1 is precisely an element of SO_group).

- theorem O_mod_SO_equiv_units (n) : ∃ iso : O_group n → Units Int, Function.Surjective iso ∧ (∀ g h, iso g = iso h ↔ ∃ s : SO_group n, g.1 = h.1 * s.1): Asserts existence of a surjective map to Units ℤ with the property that two elements have the same image iff they differ by right-multiplication by an element of SO(n). This exactly says the fibers are right cosets modulo SO(n), so the induced map from the set of cosets O(n)/SO(n) to Units ℤ is a bijection (at the set level). It encodes the quotient-to-Units isomorphism, though it does not specify a group structure or homomorphism property explicitly.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- First claim: “SO(n) ◁ O(n)”. The code’s theorem SO_normal_in_O asserts conjugation by any g ∈ O(n) maps any h ∈ SO(n) back into SO(n). This is the core normality property. The code does not explicitly state subgroup structure, but SO_group is defined as orthogonal matrices with det = 1, which are (set-theoretically) a subset of O_group by definition. Thus, the code captures the essential content of normality (closure under conjugation) in a standard matrix formalization.

- Second claim: “O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^×”. The code provides two complementary formulations:
  • exists_det_sign_surj_ker: a surjective map O(n) → Units ℤ whose kernel is exactly SO(n) (expressed by the equivalence det_sign g = 1 ↔ det g = 1 for g ∈ O(n)). This is the standard route to the isomorphism via the First Isomorphism Theorem.
  • O_mod_SO_equiv_units: a surjective map whose fibers are precisely right cosets by SO(n), which encodes a bijection between the quotient set O(n)/SO(n) and Units ℤ.

3) Differences and potential shortcomings:
- The code does not endow O_group and SO_group with explicit group instances nor state that the maps are group homomorphisms, so the final isomorphism is formulated at the level of sets (surjection + coset characterization), not explicitly as a group isomorphism. However, the properties stated (kernel characterization and fiber = coset characterization) are exactly those underlying the standard group isomorphism O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^×.
- The normality statement is expressed as closure under conjugation by g with gᵀ in place of g⁻¹, which is correct for orthogonal g (since gᵀ = g⁻¹). The inclusion SO ⊆ O is implicit in the definition of SO_group. The subgroup axioms for SO are not stated, but the normality property is captured.

Overall, the code is a faithful formal counterpart: it defines O(n) and SO(n) correctly, expresses normality via conjugation, and encodes the quotient-to-Units isomorphism via a surjective map with kernel and coset-fiber characterizations. The only mild deviation is not packaging this as a group isomorphism or using mathlib’s group structures, but this does not materially change the mathematical content of the claims.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- The file imports Mathlib.
- It defines several predicates with the prefix `jirilebl_`:
  - `jirilebl_is_domain (U : Set Complex) : Prop := True` means “U is a domain” but is defined to always be true (a placeholder, not the actual notion of domain in complex analysis, which should mean open and connected).
  - `jirilebl_is_holomorphic_on (U : Set Complex) (f : Complex → Complex) : Prop := True` is a placeholder for “f is holomorphic on U,” always true.
  - `jirilebl_has_zero_of_order (g : Complex → Complex) (z : Complex) (m : Nat) : Prop := True` is a placeholder for “g has a zero of order m at z,” always true.
  - `jirilebl_is_neighborhood (z : Complex) (V : Set Complex) : Prop := True` is a placeholder for “V is a neighborhood of z,” always true.
  - `jirilebl_has_exactly_m_points_counted_with_multiplicity (S : Set Complex) (m : Nat) : Prop := True` is a placeholder for “S has exactly m points counted with multiplicities,” always true.
  - `jirilebl_has_derivative_zero_at (f : Complex → Complex) (z : Complex) : Prop := True` is a placeholder for “f'(z) = 0,” always true.
- The theorem `jirilebl_ca_ca_2718` states: Given U ⊆ ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, z0, c ∈ ℂ, and m : ℕ, and hypotheses
  - `hU : jirilebl_is_domain U` (placeholder, always true),
  - `hf : jirilebl_is_holomorphic_on U f` (placeholder, always true),
  - `h_not_const : ¬ (∀ z ∈ U, f z = f z0)` (f is not the constant function equal to f z0 on U),
  - `hz0_in : z0 ∈ U`,
  - `hfz0 : f z0 = c`,
  - `hder0 : jirilebl_has_derivative_zero_at f z0` (placeholder, always true),
  then conclude
  - `(∀ z ∈ U, f z = c) ∨ (jirilebl_has_zero_of_order (fun z => f z - c) z0 m ∧ ∃ V, jirilebl_is_neighborhood z0 V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ jirilebl_has_exactly_m_points_counted_with_multiplicity (f ⁻¹' {c} ∩ V) m)`.
  This is proved with `by sorry` (omitted proof), which is another red flag but the key issue is the placeholders.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Let U ⊂ ℂ be a domain, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and not constant. If f(z0) = c and f'(z0) = 0, then either f(z) = c for all z ∈ U, or else if z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity).
- Major issues:
  1) All the key analytic notions (domain, holomorphic on U, derivative zero at a point, zero of order m, neighborhood, counting with multiplicity) are replaced by predicates defined as `True`. These are vacuous placeholders and do not faithfully represent the intended notions. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous.
  2) The quantification over m is incorrect. In the natural language, m is the order of the zero and is thereby determined (equivalently: there exists such m with the stated property). A faithful formalization should either existentially quantify m or tie m to “the order of the zero.” In this Lean statement, m is an arbitrary parameter of the theorem, and the conclusion is a disjunction in which the second disjunct includes “has zero of order m” as a conjunct. Given the hypothesis `h_not_const` (which is included), the first disjunct “f ≡ c” is incompatible with the hypothesis (since `hfz0 : f z0 = c` makes `∀ z ∈ U, f z = c` equivalent to the negation of `h_not_const`). Hence effectively the theorem would be asserting that for any m, z0 is a zero of order m and the counting conclusion holds, which is false unless m equals the actual order. The correct statement should be “either f ≡ c on U, or there exists m (the order) such that ...” or equivalently: if z0 is a zero of order m, then there exists a neighborhood with exactly m preimages. The present universal parameter m makes the statement too strong and not faithful.
  3) The function type is `f : Complex → Complex` while the original is `f : U → ℂ` with holomorphic on U. One can formalize with `f : ℂ → ℂ` and a predicate `HolomorphicOn U f`, but here that predicate is a placeholder, and the restriction to U is otherwise handled only by set membership. This, combined with the placeholder, is not faithful.
  4) The theorem includes `by sorry`. While the task allows omitting proofs, the use of vacuous predicates makes the statement meaningless regardless of proof.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code uses vacuous definitions for all core analytic concepts, so it does not capture the mathematical content. Additionally, it mishandles the quantification over m, making the statement (if non-vacuous) incorrect: it asserts a disjunction with a second conjunct involving an arbitrary fixed m rather than the actual order or an existential m. It also redundantly assumes non-constancy while keeping the constant case in the disjunction, creating logical tension with the hypothesis. Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous placeholders for all key notions: severe violation.
- Wrong quantification over m: even with proper definitions, the statement would not be faithful.
- Hence it fits the rubric “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.”

- The theorem declaration: `theorem abs_add_eq_abs_sub_iff_pure_imaginary {z w : ℂ} (h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w) : Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w) ↔ (z * star w).re = 0`.
  In words: For complex numbers z and w, assuming |z| = |w|, we have that |z + w| = |z − w| if and only if the real part of z times the conjugate of w is zero. Here `star w` denotes the complex conjugate of w, and `(z * star w).re = 0` expresses that z·conj(w) is purely imaginary.
  The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If z,w ∈ ℂ and |z| = |w|, then |z + w| = |z − w| iff z\bar{w} is purely imaginary.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: same hypotheses (|z| = |w|), same equivalence conclusion, and the phrase ""purely imaginary"" is correctly formalized as real part zero of z·conj(w).

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.
- ""Purely imaginary"" is standardly represented by real part zero, which includes the zero complex number, matching usual mathematical usage.
- Notation differences (abs vs |·|, star vs conjugate) are faithful translations.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is an accurate and faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2. Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language: it quantifies over z ∈ ℂ and asserts |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|. The LHS uses `Complex.abs (Complex.cos z)`, and the RHS uses `abs (Real.cos z.re)` which is precisely |cos(Re z)| as a real absolute value.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, if |z| < 1, then |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * (|z|/(1 - |z|)). Here `Complex.abs` is the modulus |·| on ℂ (real-valued), and `Complex.arctan` is the complex arctangent. The right-hand side is a real expression since Complex.abs returns a real, and π is real.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean statement matches exactly the natural language statement: it quantifies over z ∈ ℂ; assumes |z| < 1; concludes the stated inequality with the same constants and expressions. It uses modulus for both z and arctan z, and the complex arctangent, as appropriate when z ∈ ℂ.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Domain: ℂ in both.
- Hypothesis: |z| < 1 in both.
- Conclusion: |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * (|z|/(1 - |z|)) in both, with absolute values interpreted as complex modulus and the RHS purely real-valued. No extraneous assumptions or generalizations. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions.
Therefore, the formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem normSq_add (a b : ℂ) : ... := by sorry`: For arbitrary complex numbers `a` and `b`, the statement asserts an equality. The left-hand side `Complex.normSq (a + b)` is |a + b|^2 (since `Complex.normSq z = re z^2 + im z^2 = |z|^2 ∈ ℝ`). The right-hand side is `Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b + 2 * (Complex.re (a * starRingEnd ℂ b))`, which reads |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a * conj(b)), since `starRingEnd ℂ b` is complex conjugation of `b` and `Complex.re` is the real part. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for this audit as no auxiliary fake definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For a, b ∈ ℂ, |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b). The Lean statement exactly matches this: `Complex.normSq` represents |·|^2 and `Complex.re (a * starRingEnd ℂ b)` represents Re(a \bar b). The scalar 2 is a real number multiplying the real part, as expected.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are used.
- No change in generality or specialization; the domain is ℂ, and the identity is precisely the one stated.
- Notational differences (`normSq`, `starRingEnd`) match the mathematical objects (|·|^2, conjugation). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's mathematical library.
- Comment block: Declares the intent to state simple bounds for complex hyperbolic sine and cosine, with proofs omitted (`sorry`).
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_exp_half (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of sinh(z) is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z, i.e., |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_exp_half (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of cosh(z) is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z, i.e., |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Let z ∈ C. Prove that |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.”
- The Lean theorems precisely assert these two inequalities for all complex z, using Complex.abs for |·|, Complex.sinh/Complex.cosh, and Real.exp for the exponential. The factor (1/2) is represented as (1 / 2) * Real.exp(Complex.abs z), which is equivalent to 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with omitted proofs, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statements and the natural language claims are the same mathematically in scope and content. No extra hypotheses or weakened/strengthened claims are introduced. Hence, the translation is faithful.

Note: Whether the second inequality is mathematically true is outside the scope of this translation audit; we only assess faithfulness of the formal statement to the given natural language.

theorem abs_sin_complex_ge_abs_sin_re (z : ℂ) :
  Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.sin z.re) := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, providing complex numbers, trigonometric functions, and absolute value definitions.
- `theorem abs_sin_complex_ge_abs_sin_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.sin z.re) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: for any complex number `z`, the complex absolute value of the complex sine of `z` is greater than or equal to the complex absolute value of the complex sine of `z.re`. Here `z.re : ℝ` is the real part of `z`, which is implicitly coerced to a complex number when passed to `Complex.sin`.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |sin z| ≥ |sin (Re z)|.
- Left side: `|sin z|` matches `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z)`.
- Right side: `|sin (Re z)|` can be interpreted as the absolute value of the sine of a real number. In Lean, this is expressed as `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z.re)` by coercing `z.re : ℝ` into `ℂ` before applying `Complex.sin`; the complex absolute value of a purely real complex number equals the real absolute value. Thus the formalization matches the intended meaning.
- There are no extra hypotheses or restrictions; it's universally quantified over `z : ℂ`, as desired.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
Yes. The Lean statement is a faithful formalization. The minor technicality is that the right-hand side uses complex sine and complex absolute value applied to `z.re` viewed as a complex number; this is equivalent to the real sine and real absolute value in this context, so it matches the original statement precisely. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- s (k : ℕ) : PowerSeries ℤ := PowerSeries.mk (fun n => if k ∣ n then 1 else 0).
  This defines the power series s_k = 1 + X^k + X^{2k} + ⋯ over ℤ, since the coefficient of X^n is 1 exactly when n is a multiple of k.

- G (m : ℕ) : PowerSeries ℤ := (range m).prod (fun i => s (i + 1)).
  This is the finite product ∏_{k=1}^m s_k = ∏_{k=1}^m (1 + X^k + X^{2k} + ⋯).

- p (n : ℕ) : ℤ := PowerSeries.coeff ℤ n (G (n + 1)).
  This defines p(n) to be the coefficient of X^n in the finite product ∏_{k=1}^{n+1} (1 + X^k + X^{2k} + ⋯).
  Note: this is not defined as the number of integer partitions; it is defined via a coefficient of a truncated product.

- theorem partition_generating_function_coeff (n : ℕ) : coeff n (mk (fun m => p m)) = coeff n (G (n + 1)).
  This claims that the nth coefficient of the power series whose coefficients are p(m) equals the nth coefficient of G(n+1). Since p(n) was defined to be coeff n (G(n+1)), this is essentially tautological (though the proof is omitted). It does not mention any infinite product.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The original statement asserts an identity of formal power series: ∑_{n≥0} p(n) X^n = ∏_{k=1}^∞ 1/(1 - X^k), where p(n) denotes the number of partitions of n. A faithful formalization would either:
- Define p(n) as the partition function and prove that the generating series equals the infinite product, or
- Define the infinite product (as a product of formal power series with 1 as constant term, using the standard notion of infinite products in PowerSeries) and show coefficient-wise equality for all n.

The provided code does neither. It avoids the infinite product entirely, replacing it with a finite product G(n+1), and defines p(n) to be the coefficient of that finite product. The theorem then merely restates this definition at the level of coefficients. There is no mention of partitions, nor of the infinite product ∏_{k=1}^∞ 1/(1 - X^k). While it is true mathematically that the coefficient of X^n in the infinite product equals the coefficient in G(m) for any m > n (stability of coefficients), this crucial step is not stated or used. Therefore, the code does not formalize the intended generating function identity.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code does not define p(n) as the number of partitions of n.
- The code does not define or assert equality with the infinite product ∏_{k=1}^∞ 1/(1 - X^k).
- The theorem is a tautology arising from the definition of p(n) and only relates to a finite product G(n+1).
- Hence, the mathematical content is significantly weaker and different from the original statement.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful to the natural language statement.

Here `| · |` on complex numbers denotes the complex modulus (a real number), and `Real.exp |z|` is e^{|z|}. The conjunction `∧` bundles the two inequalities together.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean theorem exactly matches the natural language statement: it quantifies over z ∈ ℂ and asserts the two stated inequalities. Using `Real.exp |z|` is the standard formalization of e^{|z|}. The factor `(1 / 2 : ℝ) * ...` matches 1/2 · e^{|z|}. The use of a conjunction to express both inequalities in one theorem is faithful to the wording “and”.

- `theorem complex.abs_cos_ge_abs_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`:
  - This declares a theorem named `complex.abs_cos_ge_abs_re`.
  - It states: for any complex number `z`, the complex modulus of `cos(z)` is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of `cos(Re z)`.
  - Here `z.re : ℝ` is coerced to a complex number `(z.re : ℂ)` before applying `Complex.cos`, which matches the usual interpretation because for real inputs, `Complex.cos` coincides with `Real.cos`, and `Complex.abs` of a real number equals its real absolute value.
  - The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for checking the faithfulness of the statement.

Step 2: Compare the whole translation to the natural language statement
- Natural language: ""Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|.""
- Lean statement: Exactly the same mathematical content: for all `z : ℂ`, `|cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|`, with the right-hand side formed by taking the real part, coercing to ℂ, applying complex cosine, and taking complex modulus. This matches the standard interpretation of the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem is stated.
- The use of `Complex.cos (z.re : ℂ)` corresponds to `cos(Re z)` and `Complex.abs` corresponds to the absolute value. For real arguments, these coincide with the real cosine and real absolute value, so there is no semantic mismatch.
- The lowercase namespace `complex` in the theorem name is a naming choice and does not affect the mathematical content.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sec z| ≥ |sec (Re z)|. The Lean statement is exactly: for all z : ℂ, |Complex.sec z| ≥ |Complex.sec z.re|. This matches the quantification and the inequality direction.
- The right-hand side uses `Complex.sec z.re` rather than a purely real `Real.sec (z.re)`, but since `z.re` is a real coerced to ℂ and the absolute value is the complex modulus, this is effectively the same; for real inputs, complex secant takes real values, and the moduli coincide. This is a standard and acceptable formalization detail.

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement.
- The only subtlety is that Mathlib’s `Complex.sec` is a total function (defined even at poles via 1/0), whereas the informal statement treats sec as the usual (meromorphic/partial) function. This is a minor formalization nuance commonly accepted in Mathlib and does not change the intended inequality statement.
- Inequality direction, domains, and quantities match. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The statement introduces U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. This matches the hypothesis that U ⊂ ℂ is open.
- ψ : ℂ × ℝ → ℂ is a function on the product space. Although the natural language has ψ defined on U × [0,1], the Lean code uses a global function and restricts the continuity to U × [0,1]; this is a standard and faithful formalization technique.
- hψ : ContinuousOn ψ (U ×ˢ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) asserts ψ is continuous on U × [0,1]. This matches the hypothesis that ψ is continuous on U × [0,1].
- hψ' : ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ψ (z, t)) U asserts that for each t ∈ [0,1], the function z ↦ ψ(z, t) is complex-differentiable on U. Over ℂ, DifferentiableOn ℂ is exactly the formalization of holomorphic on U. This matches the hypothesis that for each fixed t, z ↦ ψ(z,t) is holomorphic on U.
- Conclusion: DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => integral (restrict volume (Icc 0 1)) (fun t => ψ (z, t))) U. This says the function h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z, t) dt is complex-differentiable on U, i.e., holomorphic on U. The integral is the Lebesgue integral over [0,1] with respect to the restricted Lebesgue measure, which matches the standard ∫_0^1 dt.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U open in ℂ; ψ: U × [0,1] → ℂ continuous; for each t, z ↦ ψ(z,t) holomorphic on U; conclude h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z,t) dt is holomorphic on U. The Lean version encodes exactly these assumptions: continuity on U × [0,1], holomorphy (as DifferentiableOn ℂ) in z for each t on U, and concludes DifferentiableOn ℂ on U. Using a globally defined ψ with a ContinuousOn restriction is a standard equivalent way to formalize domain-restricted continuity.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: NL defines ψ only on U × [0,1]; Lean defines ψ on ℂ × ℝ but restricts the needed properties to U × [0,1]. This is a harmless generalization and faithful.
- Holomorphic vs DifferentiableOn ℂ: In mathlib, for functions ℂ → ℂ, DifferentiableOn ℂ on an open set corresponds to being holomorphic. Faithful.
- Integration: Lean uses Lebesgue integral over Icc(0,1) via measure restriction, which is the standard formalization of ∫_0^1. Faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable here since we are only auditing the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's complex analysis and real analysis libraries.
- Comment states the goal: for z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` translates to: For any complex number z, the absolute value (modulus) of sinh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z. Here `Complex.abs z` is |z|, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential; `(1/2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` similarly asserts: For any z ∈ ℂ, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statements exactly match the natural language inequalities, with correct use of complex modulus and real exponential. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements are provided (proofs omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

3) Comparison for differences:
- Variables: both statements quantify over all z ∈ ℂ.
- Quantities: |sinh z| and |cosh z| are bounded by (1/2) e^{|z|} in both.
- Notation: Lean’s `Complex.abs` and `Real.exp` correctly represent |·| and e^{·} on ℝ with input |z|.
- No domain or constant mismatch. No generalization or restriction beyond the original.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the math library.
- Docstring: States the exact natural language goal: for z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1 - z)| ≤ ∑ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|).
- `lemma abs_log_one_sub_le_sum_geometric (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry`:
  Hypotheses: z is a complex number and |z| < 1.
  Conclusion: A conjunction (∧) of two inequalities:
  • `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)`
  • `∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`
  Here `∑'` is the (topological) infinite sum over ℕ, and `(n : ℝ)` coerces n to a real. The term for n = 0 is `(abs z)^0 / 0 = 1 / 0`, which in Lean’s fields is definitionally 0 (since inv 0 = 0), so the n = 0 term contributes 0. Therefore the tsum from n : ℕ equals the series from n = 1 to ∞.

2) Faithfulness check to the natural language statement:
- Hypothesis |z| < 1 matches.
- The first inequality |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n is stated exactly (with the tsum equivalent to starting at n = 1 due to the zero 0th term).
- The second inequality ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|) is also stated exactly.
- Using a conjunction (∧) to express the pair of inequalities corresponds to “A ≤ S ≤ B”.
- All objects are standard: Complex.log denotes the principal complex logarithm; Complex.abs is the modulus; sums are real-valued, matching the statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is the same mathematical claim as the natural language version. The only technical difference is indexing the sum over ℕ with an extra n = 0 term that is zero, which does not change the value and is standard in Lean. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions. Thus the translation is faithful.

- `theorem abs_sinh_le_ext (z : ℂ) : abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_ext (z : ℂ) : abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement asks to prove two inequalities for every complex z: |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The code presents exactly these as two theorems, each quantified over an arbitrary z : ℂ, using Complex.sinh, Complex.cosh, abs for complex modulus, and Real.exp for the real exponential applied to |z|. Splitting the conjunction into two separate theorems is a standard and faithful reformulation.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification over all z ∈ ℂ matches: both theorems take arbitrary z : ℂ.
- The inequalities and constants (1/2) and e^{|z|} are exactly as stated.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are provided (proofs omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing).
Thus, the Lean statements faithfully capture the natural language claims.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library, providing definitions for complex numbers, absolute value, hyperbolic functions, and the real exponential.
- `/-- Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. -/` is a docstring restating the first natural language claim.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` states: For any complex number z, the absolute value of sinh z is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp of the absolute value (modulus) of z. This matches |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `/-- Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. -/` is a docstring restating the second claim.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` states: For any complex number z, the absolute value of cosh z is less than or equal to (1/2) times exp(|z|). This matches |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The two Lean theorems exactly state the two inequalities from the natural language statement, using standard Mathlib notations: Complex.abs for |·| on ℂ, Complex.sinh/cosh, and Real.exp for e^{·}. The scalar (1/2) is explicitly a real. The statements are pointwise in z ∈ ℂ, as requested.
- There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; the theorems are declared with `sorry` (admitted proofs), which is acceptable for the purpose of translation fidelity.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statements are equivalent to the original inequalities. The structure (splitting into two theorems instead of a combined statement) is a harmless presentation change.
- No scope, quantifier, or notational discrepancies affect meaning. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Note: Mathematically, the cosh inequality as stated is actually false for real z > 0 (cosh x > (1/2)e^x). However, the task here is to verify translation fidelity, not correctness. The Lean code faithfully encodes the given (albeit false) claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in Mathlib.
- `open Complex` and `open Finset` allow using names from these namespaces without prefixes.
- The theorem statement: `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_19562 (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) :` universally quantifies over a complex number z and a natural number n.
- Left-hand side: `Complex.abs ((Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => (z ^ k) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) - exp z)` means the complex absolute value of the difference between the finite sum over k = 0..n of z^k divided by k! (with k! coerced to ℂ) and the complex exponential exp z. Using `Finset.range (n+1)` indeed sums over {0, ..., n}. With `open Complex`, `exp z` is `Complex.exp z`.
- Right-hand side: `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is |z|^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! (coerced to ℝ) times e^{|z|}. This matches the intended expression (|z|^{n+1})/(n+1)! * e^{|z|}.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it’s a direct theorem statement with a placeholder proof `by sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ and all n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}. The Lean statement exactly encodes this, with the sum over 0..n, complex exp on the left, and real exp(|z|) on the right, using the appropriate coercions for factorial and absolute values.

3) Final check/differences:
- The sum bounds, factorial coercions, absolute values, and exponentials are all correctly typed and correspond precisely to the mathematical statement.
- Multiplication vs division grouping on the RHS is equivalent.
- No extraneous conditions or generalizations/specializations.
Therefore, the two statements are the same.

  This declares: For any complex z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of (|z|)^(n+1) equals |z|/(1−|z|). Here ∑' is the topological sum (tsum) over ℕ. Since the term is (|z|)^(n+1), the sum is effectively ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^{n+1} which is the same as ∑_{m=1}^∞ |z|^m by reindexing. The quantities are in ℝ because Complex.abs z : ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Hypothesis |z| < 1 matches exactly.
- Conclusion: The series equals |z|/(1−|z|) matches exactly, with the sum starting at 1; the Lean code uses n+1 from n=0, which is the same series by reindexing.

- No extraneous assumptions or omissions.

- `theorem abs_sin_le_exp_half {z : ℂ} : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 : ℝ) / 2 * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus of sin z is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). That is, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_exp_half {z : ℂ} : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 : ℝ) / 2 * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus of cos z is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). That is, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Step 2: Whole translation vs original statement
The original statement asks: Let z ∈ C. Prove that |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The two Lean theorems state exactly these two inequalities for an arbitrary complex number z. The use of `Complex.abs` for |·| and `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` for e^{|z|} is standard. The factor `(1 : ℝ) / 2 *` corresponds to the 1/2 multiplier. The quantification `{z : ℂ}` makes the statements universally quantified over complex numbers, matching the natural language.

Step 3: Final check for differences
There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with omitted proofs (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions. The mathematical content and quantification match exactly. No generalization or specialization is introduced. Thus, the translation is faithful.

  Hypotheses: z is a complex number, with assumption `|z| < 1`.
  Conclusion: A conjunction of two inequalities:
  a) `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ)`.
     This is |log(1 − z)| ≤ sum over n ∈ ℕ of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1). Since `n` starts at 0 in Lean and the summand involves `(n+1)`, this equals ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k, matching the natural-language index.
  b) `∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`.
     This is the bound ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
  The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for auditing translation.

2) Assess faithfulness to the original statement:
- The hypothesis |z| < 1 is identical.
- The left inequality is exactly |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n, with the index shift handled properly.
- The right inequality is exactly ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The absolute value and logarithm are the complex absolute and complex principal logarithm, appropriate given z is complex and the original also uses complex z.
- Presenting the two inequalities as a conjunction (∧) is equivalent to the chained inequality in the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra assumptions or weakened/strengthened claims are introduced.
- Indexing of the series is faithful via the (n+1) shift.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof.
- Using Complex.log aligns with the context of complex z.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- Left-hand side: `Complex.abs (((Finset.range (n + 1)).sum fun k => (z ^ k) / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z)` means the absolute value of the difference between the partial sum of the exponential power series up to k = n and the complex exponential exp z. Here, `Finset.range (n + 1)` indexes k = 0, 1, ..., n; `(Nat.factorial k : ℂ)` is the factorial cast to ℂ; and `Complex.exp z` is e^z.
- Right-hand side: `(Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (Nat.factorial (n + 1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is |z|^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! (as a real number) times e^{|z|} (with `Real.exp` denoting the real exponential function). The inequality is between real numbers (since `Complex.abs` returns ℝ), so everything is consistent in ℝ.
- `:= by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this does not affect the statement's content.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
Natural language: For all z in ℂ and all n in ℕ, | sum_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z | ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.
Lean: Exactly the same content:
- Sum over k = 0..n: expressed via `range (n+1)`.
- Complex exponential e^z: `Complex.exp z`.
- Absolute value of complex number: `Complex.abs`.
- RHS is (|z|^(n+1))/(n+1)! times e^{|z|}: written as division then multiplication in ℝ.
There is no mismatch in domains or indexing.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domains: ℂ for z, ℕ for n match.
- Indexing: k = 0 to n matches `range (n+1)`.
- Absolute value and exponentials correspond correctly.
- Casting of factorials and use of Real vs Complex is consistent with the inequality in ℝ.
No discrepancies found. The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- import Mathlib: Brings in the Mathlib library with complex analysis and real analysis definitions.
- open Complex: Opens the Complex namespace to allow shorter names.
- theorem abs_sin_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ Real.exp (Complex.abs z) / 2 := by sorry
  This states: For any complex number z, the modulus of sin z is less than or equal to exp(|z|)/2. Here Complex.abs is the complex modulus |·|, Complex.sin is the complex sine, and Real.exp is the real exponential function. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement itself is clear.
- theorem abs_cos_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ Real.exp (Complex.abs z) / 2 := by sorry
  This states: For any complex number z, the modulus of cos z is less than or equal to exp(|z|)/2. Again, proof omitted but the statement is precise.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For z in C, prove |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- Lean statements: |sin z| ≤ exp(|z|)/2 and |cos z| ≤ exp(|z|)/2.
These are exactly the same inequalities, since exp(|z|)/2 = (1/2)·exp(|z|) = (1/2) e^{|z|}. The use of Complex.abs for |·| is standard, and Real.exp for e^{·} is correct. There are no additional hypotheses or changes in quantifiers: both theorems are universally quantified over z : ℂ, matching the natural language.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced; only two theorems are stated, each directly corresponding to one of the two desired inequalities. There is no change in strength, no generalization or specialization, and no mismatch in constants or functions. The division by 2 matches the factor 1/2 in the statement. The code faithfully encodes the intended statements.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- The docstring states the polarization identity for complex numbers.
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) :` Introduces the statement for arbitrary complex numbers z and w.
- `4 * z * Star.star w = ...` Left-hand side is 4 times z times the star (complex conjugate) of w, i.e., 4 z \bar w.

- `+ Complex.I * (↑(Complex.abs (z + Complex.I * w) ^ 2) - ↑(Complex.abs (z - Complex.I * w) ^ 2))` This is i times (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2), again with coercions from ℝ to ℂ.
- `by sorry`: No proof provided, which is acceptable for auditing the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement:
- Uses complex conjugation via `Star.star w`.
- Uses the complex unit `Complex.I` for i.
- Expresses the absolute value squared as `Complex.abs (...) ^ 2`, correctly coerced to ℂ to add with an imaginary term.
- The algebraic structure and terms correspond precisely to the given identity.

3) Final check for differences:
- Notational differences only: `Star.star w` for \bar w, `Complex.I` for i, and explicit coercions from ℝ to ℂ. These are standard formalization details and do not change the meaning.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib, which contains definitions for complex analysis, conformality, and derivatives.
- The theorem declaration:
  - `theorem conformal_at_iff_deriv_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ} (hf : AnalyticAt ℂ f z0) : ConformalAt f z0 ↔ deriv f z0 ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  - In words: Let f : ℂ → ℂ and z0 : ℂ. Assume hf: f is complex-analytic (holomorphic) at z0. Then f is conformal at z0 if and only if the complex derivative of f at z0 is nonzero.
  - `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0` expresses that f is holomorphic at the point z0.
  - `ConformalAt f z0` is the Mathlib predicate that f is conformal at z0 (as a real conformal map between ℝ^2 ≃ ℂ), and in the complex-analytic setting this aligns with the standard notion.
  - `deriv f z0` is the complex derivative of f at z0; the statement asserts `deriv f z0 ≠ 0`.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.”
- The code assumes `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0`, i.e., holomorphic at z0, which is the local hypothesis needed for conformality at z0. The natural language says f is holomorphic (typically globally), but the theorem concerns a single point z0; being holomorphic globally implies being holomorphic at z0, and the local assumption is sufficient. This is a slight generalization (weaker hypothesis) but entirely faithful to the intended local statement.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem is stated directly using standard Mathlib notions.
- The equivalence `ConformalAt f z0 ↔ deriv f z0 ≠ 0` under holomorphic-at-z0 is precisely the classical result.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically the same in meaning, with the Lean version slightly more general in hypothesis (local analyticity vs global holomorphic), which is acceptable and faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Uses mathlib.
- def unit_disk : Set ℂ := { z | z.abs < (1 : ℝ) }: Defines the open unit disk in the complex plane as the set of complex numbers with absolute value less than 1. This matches the intended notion of 𝔻.
- def holomorphic_on (f : ℂ → ℂ) (s : Set ℂ) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate for holomorphic_on that is always True. This is a vacuous definition and not the real analytic predicate from mathlib. Red flag.

No assumption that f maps the unit disk into itself. The proof is omitted with sorry.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ 𝔻.” Key components:
- Domain and codomain: f maps the unit disk into itself (codomain restriction), i.e., for all z ∈ 𝔻, f(z) ∈ 𝔻.
- Holomorphic on the disk.
- f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion: |f z| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ 𝔻.

In the Lean code:
- The domain/codomain condition f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is not represented; f is a function ℂ → ℂ and there is no hypothesis that f(z) ∈ unit_disk for z ∈ unit_disk, nor any bound |f z| ≤ 1.
- The holomorphic_on predicate is a vacuous True placeholder, not the genuine holomorphic condition. This violates the guideline about auxiliary definitions being faithful and not vacuous.
- The conclusion matches the inequality, but since key hypotheses are missing or vacuous, the statement is not faithful.

3) Final comparison:
They are different. The Lean code omits the crucial hypothesis that f maps the unit disk into itself and replaces holomorphicity with a vacuous predicate. Even if holomorphic_on were replaced by the real notion, the missing mapping-to-disk condition remains, so the theorem statement would still be weaker than the natural language Schwarz lemma. Hence, the translation fails.

Given these issues, this is not a faithful translation.

  states: For any complex number z, the absolute value (modulus) of tanh z is less than or equal to tanh of the absolute value of the real part of z. Here `|tanh z|` is the complex modulus (a real number), `z.re` is the real part of z (a real number), `|z.re|` is the real absolute value, and `tanh` on the right is the real hyperbolic tangent.

- The theorem statement: `theorem normSq_add (a b : ℂ) : normSq (a + b) = normSq a + normSq b + 2 * re (a * star b)`.
  In words: For complex numbers a and b, the square of the norm (normSq) of a + b equals the normSq of a plus the normSq of b plus 2 times the real part of a times the conjugate of b. Here, `normSq z` is |z|^2, `re` is the real part, and `star b` is the complex conjugate of b.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: For a, b ∈ ℂ, |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar{b}).
- In Lean: `normSq (a + b)` corresponds to |a + b|^2; `normSq a` and `normSq b` correspond to |a|^2 and |b|^2; `re (a * star b)` corresponds to Re(a \bar{b}). The factor 2 matches exactly.
- Thus the theorem statement is precisely the same equality in Mathlib’s notation.

3) Final check:
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only the theorem is stated (with `sorry` as a placeholder for the proof, which is acceptable for this auditing task). The mathematical content matches exactly. No generalization or restriction beyond the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem det_complex_map (ξ ζ : ℂ) states that for complex numbers ξ and ζ, the real-number identity
  (ξ.re + ζ.re) * (ξ.re - ζ.re) - (-ξ.im + ζ.im) * (ξ.im + ζ.im) = (Complex.abs ξ ^ 2) - (Complex.abs ζ ^ 2)
  holds. The left-hand side is a specific algebraic expression in terms of the real and imaginary parts of ξ and ζ. The right-hand side is the difference of the squares of the moduli (absolute values) of ξ and ζ, i.e., |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- The docstring clarifies the intended interpretation: this algebraic expression on the left is the determinant of the 2×2 real matrix representing the real-linear map z ↦ ξ z + ζ conj z with respect to the real basis (1, i) of ℂ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: if M is the 2×2 real matrix representing z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z}, then det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- In coordinates, writing ξ = a + ib and ζ = c + id, the real-linear map z = x + iy ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z} has matrix
  [ a + c   -b + d ]
  [ b + d    a - c ]
  relative to the basis (1, i). Its determinant is exactly
  (a+c)(a-c) − (−b + d)(b + d),
  which is precisely the left-hand side of the Lean equality when identifying a = ξ.re, b = ξ.im, c = ζ.re, d = ζ.im. The right-hand side equals |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2 since (Complex.abs ξ)^2 = a^2 + b^2 and similarly for ζ.
- Thus, the Lean theorem states exactly the determinant identity required by the natural language statement. While the theorem does not explicitly define the matrix M or use a det operator, it presents the exact expanded determinant expression and equates it to |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2, which is an explicit and faithful restatement of the claim.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No change in hypotheses or generality: ξ, ζ are arbitrary complex numbers in both versions.
- The only difference is that the Lean code uses the explicit expanded determinant formula rather than the det symbol, which is a standard and faithful way to state the same result.
- Signs and terms match the correct matrix representation.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean theorems directly and exactly formalize the two inequalities from the natural language statement, using standard Mathlib notions: ℂ for complex numbers, Complex.abs for absolute value, Complex.sin and Complex.cos, and Real.exp for the exponential. The factor (1/2) is represented as `(1 / 2) *` and |z| as `Complex.abs z`, matching e^{|z|} as `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only the two theorem statements are present, with omitted proofs (acceptable in this auditing task since we judge translation, not validity or proof).

3) Final check:
- The Lean code statements and the natural language statements are the same in mathematical content and quantification (for all z ∈ ℂ). Notational differences are purely syntactic and standard. Hence, the translation is faithful.

(Independent of this audit, note the cosine inequality as stated is actually false at z = 0, but this does not affect the faithfulness of the translation; the code mirrors the claim exactly.)

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The Lean theorem exactly encodes the statement: it universally quantifies over z ∈ ℂ, assumes ‖z‖ < 1, and concludes the desired inequality. The use of `Complex.log` corresponds to the principal branch of the complex logarithm in mathlib, which is the standard choice; for |z| < 1, 1 − z ≠ 0, so the logarithm is well-defined. The left-hand side uses the complex norm ‖·‖, matching the absolute value in the natural statement. The right-hand side is precisely ‖z‖/(1 − ‖z‖), matching the statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code states exactly the theorem to be proved.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. Both assert: for any complex z with |z| < 1, the inequality |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|) holds. There are no extraneous hypotheses or missing conditions. The only implicit choice is the branch of log, and mathlib’s `Complex.log` is the principal branch, which is the standard interpretation for such inequalities.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- Comment block: States the natural language goal: For a complex number z, show |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|.
- `open Complex`: Opens the Complex namespace so `cos`, `abs`, etc., refer to complex versions by default.
- `theorem abs_cos_ge_abs_cos_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (cos (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`:
  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number z, asserting the inequality |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|, where the right-hand side is interpreted as the complex cosine applied to the real part of z, coerced into ℂ, and then taking the complex modulus.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|.”
- The Lean statement universally quantifies over z : ℂ and asserts `Complex.abs (cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (cos (z.re : ℂ))`.
- Using `(z.re : ℂ)` with `Complex.cos` matches the intended meaning, since `Complex.cos (x : ℂ) = (Real.cos x : ℂ)` and `Complex.abs` on a real complex number equals the usual absolute value. Therefore the formal statement is exactly the same as the natural language statement.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem precisely states the inequality for all complex z.
- No strengthening or weakening is present. The formal and natural statements coincide.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open scoped Real` just set up the environment and real-number notation; they do not affect the mathematical content.
- The theorem declaration `/-- Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|. -/` matches the natural language description.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_abs_re (z : ℂ) : |Complex.cos z| ≥ |Complex.cos z.re| := by sorry` states: For any complex number z, the complex absolute value (modulus) of `Complex.cos z` is greater than or equal to the modulus of `Complex.cos z.re`. Here `z.re : ℝ` is coerced to ℂ when passed to `Complex.cos`. Since `Complex.cos` on a real input yields a real value (as a complex number with zero imaginary part), `|Complex.cos z.re|` equals the real absolute value of `cos (Re z)`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For z ∈ ℂ, show |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|. The Lean statement uses `Complex.cos` for both sides. On the right-hand side, this is the same as the real cosine evaluated at the real part, coerced into ℂ, and then taking the complex modulus, which equals the real absolute value. Thus the formal statement is mathematically identical to the natural language statement.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- No additional assumptions or restrictions are introduced.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are used.
- The only subtlety is that Lean uses `Complex.cos` on a coerced real, but this exactly corresponds to `cos (Re z)` in the natural language, and the absolute values coincide. Therefore, the two statements are the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem abs_add_eq_abs_sub_iff_mul_conj_real_zero {z w : ℂ} (h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w) : Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w) ↔ (z * Star.star w).re = 0 := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for complex numbers z and w. Hypothesis `h` is |z| = |w|. The conclusion is the equivalence: |z + w| = |z − w| if and only if the real part of z * conj(w) equals 0. Here `Star.star w` is the complex conjugate of w, and `.re = 0` means the number is purely imaginary.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
The natural language claims: For z, w in C with |z| = |w|, we have |z + w| = |z − w| iff z \bar{w} is purely imaginary. The Lean theorem exactly formalizes this: the hypothesis is |z| = |w|, and the equivalence is between |z + w| = |z − w| and (z * conj w).re = 0. In complex analysis, ""purely imaginary"" corresponds to having zero real part, which is exactly `(z * conj w).re = 0`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The use of `Star.star w` for conjugation matches `\bar{w}`.
- ""Purely imaginary"" is captured as real part equals 0, which is standard and includes the zero case. The natural language statement does not exclude zero, so this is faithful.
- No extra or missing conditions; the iff and the norm equality match exactly.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: bring in Mathlib and open the Complex namespace.
- The theorem statement:
  - Parameters: `U : Set ℂ`, `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
  - Hypotheses:
    - `hU : IsOpen U` means U is open in ℂ.
    - `hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` means f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
    - `h_inj : Function.Injective f` means f is injective on its whole domain ℂ.
  - Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0` means for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for this translation task as we only check the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f: U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean: U open, f holomorphic on U, and f injective (globally) imply derivative is nonzero at every z ∈ U.
- The use of `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` matches “holomorphic on U.” The conclusion `deriv f z ≠ 0` for z ∈ U matches “f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.” The only deviation is that Lean takes f to be defined on all ℂ and assumes global injectivity, whereas the natural language treats f as a function with domain U, hence injective on U only.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: The Lean hypothesis `Function.Injective f` is stronger than necessary; the natural language requires injectivity only on U. A more faithful formalization would use `Set.InjOn f U` or take `f : U → ℂ`. This is a slight specialization (stronger assumption), not a change to the mathematical content of the conclusion.
- Everything else aligns: openness of U, holomorphicity on U, and the nonvanishing derivative on U.

Verdict: The translation is essentially faithful with a mild strengthening of the injectivity hypothesis.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `locally_injective_of_deriv_ne_zero` and is stated for a set U ⊆ ℂ with hypothesis `hU : IsOpen U` (U is open), a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, a differentiability hypothesis `hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` (f is complex differentiable on U), and a nonvanishing derivative hypothesis `h : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0` (for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero).
- The conclusion is `∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V, IsOpen V ∧ z ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ InjOn f V`, i.e., for every z in U, there exists an open set V containing z, contained in U, such that f is injective on V. This asserts local injectivity of f on U.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U is open in ℂ; f: U → ℂ is holomorphic; f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U; conclude f is locally injective on U, i.e., for each z ∈ U there exists an open neighborhood V of z with V ⊆ U such that f is injective on V.
- Lean: Uses f : ℂ → ℂ with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` to encode holomorphic on U, and `deriv f z ≠ 0` for all z ∈ U. The conclusion exactly matches the local injectivity formulation: existence of an open V with z ∈ V ⊆ U and `InjOn f V`.
- The minor formalization difference (domain f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn U rather than f : U → ℂ) is standard and faithful.

3) Final check for equivalence:
- Hypotheses match: openness of U, holomorphicity (complex differentiable on U), nonvanishing derivative on U.
- Conclusion matches: local injectivity in the precise sense required.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly encodes the claim. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable here as we are only auditing the translation of the statement, not the proof.

Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language theorem.

This is exactly |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|, with the right-hand side interpreted as the complex modulus of a real number (which equals the real absolute value).

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- LHS: `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z)` corresponds to |sin z|.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `sum_abs_pow_eq` and takes `z : ℂ` with a hypothesis `hz : Complex.abs z < 1`.
- The conclusion is `HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (Complex.abs z) ^ n) (Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z))`.
- In Mathlib, `HasSum f s` for `f : ℕ → α` asserts that the infinite series ∑_{n=0}^∞ f n converges to `s`. Therefore, the code states: for |z| < 1, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^n has sum |z|/(1 − |z|).
- Note: `Complex.abs z` is a real number, so the series is in ℝ, which is fine.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asks to show ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean statement, however, uses `HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (Complex.abs z)^n) ...`, which is the series starting at n = 0, not at n = 1.
- The sum from n = 0 is known to be 1/(1 − |z|), while the sum from n = 1 is |z|/(1 − |z|). Thus, the Lean code claims the value for the n = 0 series equals the n = 1 value, which is incorrect and does not match the natural language statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are different due to an off-by-one index error. The Lean code asserts the sum from n = 0 equals |z|/(1 − |z|), while the natural language statement is about the sum from n = 1.
- A faithful Lean translation would be, for example, `HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (Complex.abs z)^(n+1)) (Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z))` or equivalently using a shifted series starting at 1.

Given this off-by-one discrepancy, the translation is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to prove, for all z ∈ ℂ, both inequalities |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- The Lean statements exactly assert these two inequalities, with `‖·‖` representing the complex absolute value and `Real.exp` the real exponential. `Complex.sinh` and `Complex.cosh` are the correct Mathlib functions.
- No extraneous assumptions or modifications are present.

3) Final check for differences:
- No discrepancies: the inequalities, domains, and functions match exactly.
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are provided (with omitted proofs, which is acceptable under the instructions).

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: We are using Mathlib, which provides the definitions of complex numbers, sine, cosine, real exponential, and norms.
- `/-- Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. -/`: A docstring restating the first natural language claim in words.
- `theorem abs_sin_le_exp_div_two (z : ℂ) : ‖Complex.sin z‖ ≤ Real.exp ‖z‖ / 2 := by sorry`: For any complex number z, the absolute value (norm) of the complex sine of z is at most (exp of the norm of z) divided by 2. This matches |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The use of `‖ · ‖` is the complex modulus, `Real.exp ‖z‖` is e^{|z|}, and `/ 2` corresponds to multiplication by 1/2.
- `/-- Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. -/`: A docstring restating the second natural language claim.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_exp_div_two (z : ℂ) : ‖Complex.cos z‖ ≤ Real.exp ‖z‖ / 2 := by sorry`: For any complex number z, the absolute value of the complex cosine of z is at most (exp of the norm of z) divided by 2. This matches |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The natural language statement has two inequalities for all z ∈ ℂ. The Lean code provides exactly two theorems, each universally quantified over z : ℂ, stating those inequalities with standard Lean/Mathlib notation: norms for absolute values, Complex.sin/Complex.cos, and Real.exp for e^{·}, and division by 2 for the factor 1/2. Splitting into two theorems instead of a single conjunctive statement is perfectly faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorems are stated directly.
- Notational correspondences are exact: ‖·‖ = absolute value on ℂ, Real.exp ‖z‖ = e^{|z|}, and `/ 2` = multiply by 1/2. The variable z ranges over ℂ as in the original. There is no change in quantification or strength.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. (Whether the inequalities are true is not under audit; we only check translation.)

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines: setup; no mathematical content change.
- The theorem `schwarz_aux_tac_4062` states: Let `f : ℂ → ℂ`. Assume:
  - `hf : DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0` meaning f is complex-differentiable at 0 (holomorphic at the point 0 only).
  - `h1 : MapsTo f (ball 0 1) (ball 0 1)` meaning for all z with |z| < 1, we have |f z| < 1; i.e., f maps the open unit disk into itself.
  - `h2 : f 0 = 0`.
  Conclusion: `‖deriv f 0‖ ≤ 1` i.e., the norm of the complex derivative at 0 is ≤ 1.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: “Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1.” Here 𝔻 is the open unit disk. Typically, “f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic” means f is holomorphic on the entire disk 𝔻 (i.e., complex differentiable at every point of 𝔻).
- Lean statement differences:
  - Domain/codomain: Lean uses `f : ℂ → ℂ` together with `MapsTo f (ball 0 1) (ball 0 1)`. This is a standard formalization of “f maps the unit disk into itself” and is acceptable as a generalization (f is defined on all ℂ but we only impose mapping property on the disk).
  - Holomorphic assumption: The natural statement requires f to be holomorphic on the disk. The Lean code only assumes `DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0` (holomorphic at 0). It does not require f to be holomorphic on any neighborhood of 0 or on the entire disk. This is a significant weakening of the hypothesis and is not faithful to the original statement.
  - The condition `f 0 = 0` matches exactly.
  - Conclusion `‖deriv f 0‖ ≤ 1` matches `|f'(0)| ≤ 1`.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code is missing the key assumption that f is holomorphic on the disk (or at least on an open neighborhood around 0 within the disk). The original statement requires holomorphy on 𝔻, which is stronger than differentiability at a single point. The rest of the statement (mapping the disk into itself, f(0)=0, and the derivative bound) aligns.

Given that the central holomorphic-on-𝔻 assumption is weakened to merely differentiable at 0, the translation is not faithful.

- `theorem abs_sin_le_cosh (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ Real.cosh z.im := by sorry`:
  - This declares a theorem named `abs_sin_le_cosh`.
  - It universally quantifies over `z : ℂ` (a complex number).
  - The statement is `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ Real.cosh z.im`.
  - Here, `Complex.abs` is the modulus |·| on complex numbers, `Complex.sin` is the complex sine, `Real.cosh` is the real hyperbolic cosine, and `z.im` denotes the imaginary part of `z`.
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but for the purposes of translation we only care about the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that if z ∈ ℂ, then |sin z| ≤ cosh(Im z).""
- The Lean statement precisely says: For any complex number `z`, `|sin z| ≤ cosh (Im z)`. The functions and notations line up exactly: modulus of complex sine bounded by hyperbolic cosine of the imaginary part.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification: Both are universal over complex `z`.
- Functions and arguments: `|sin z|` matches `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z)`, and `cosh(Im z)` matches `Real.cosh z.im`.
- No additional hypotheses or constraints are present in the Lean statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful and exact formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib definitions and theorems.
- The theorem `injective_holomorphic_deriv_ne_zero` has parameters:
  - `{U : Set ℂ}`: an open subset U of the complex plane.
  - `{f : ℂ → ℂ}`: a function from ℂ to ℂ.
  - `(hU : IsOpen U)`: U is open.
  - `(hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U)`: f is holomorphic (analytic) on U.
  - `(h_inj : Set.InjOn f U)`: f is injective on U.
  - `(z : ℂ) (hz : z ∈ U)`: an arbitrary point z in U.
  - Conclusion: `deriv f z ≠ 0`: the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- The Lean statement encodes the same: it assumes U open, f analytic on U, injective on U, and for any z ∈ U concludes deriv f z ≠ 0. The only formalization nuance is that Lean takes f : ℂ → ℂ with `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` instead of f : U → ℂ; this is a standard and faithful formalization. The derivative used is the global `deriv f z`; on an open set, this coincides with the derivative of the restriction, so this matches the intended meaning.
- Quantification over all z ∈ U is represented by taking arbitrary z and hz and concluding the inequality; this is equivalent to the universal quantification.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain: natural statement has f : U → ℂ; Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ but only assumes analyticity and injectivity on U. This is a benign and standard generalization that does not change the meaning on U.
- Derivative notion: `deriv f z` vs derivative of f|_U at z; on open U and under analyticity, these coincide.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all predicates are genuine Mathlib notions (IsOpen, AnalyticOn, InjOn, deriv).

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `theorem hasDerivAt_arctan (z : ℂ) : HasDerivAt Complex.arctan (1 / (1 + z ^ 2)) z := by sorry`
  This asserts: For every complex number z, Complex.arctan has a complex derivative at z, and that derivative equals 1/(1+z^2). There are no domain restrictions in the statement (it quantifies over all z : ℂ).

- `theorem hasDerivAt_log {z : ℂ} (hz : z ≠ 0) : HasDerivAt Complex.log (1 / z) z := by sorry`
  This asserts: For any complex number z with z ≠ 0, Complex.log has a complex derivative at z equal to 1/z. This includes the necessary domain restriction for the logarithm.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that arctan' z = 1/(1+z^2) and log'(z) = 1/z where defined.” The phrase “where defined” most naturally applies to both derivatives: each equality is meant to hold at points where the function is complex differentiable (i.e., away from singularities). In particular, for arctan, this excludes z = ±i; for log, this excludes z = 0.
- The Lean statement for log matches this exactly: it includes the z ≠ 0 restriction and states the derivative value.
- The Lean statement for arctan, however, has no restriction on z. It asserts the derivative exists and equals 1/(1+z^2) for all z ∈ ℂ, including z = ±i, where Complex.arctan is not differentiable. Thus, the Lean statement overstates the domain compared to the intended “where defined” meaning.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
- For the logarithm: yes, faithful.
- For arctan: no, the Lean theorem lacks the domain restriction (e.g., z ≠ i and z ≠ -i), so it is not a faithful translation of “where defined.”

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the issue is solely the missing domain restriction for arctan. Therefore, the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful.

The statement is: the complex modulus of `sinh z` (written `Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z)`) is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic cosine of the real part of `z` (written `Real.cosh z.re`). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but for our auditing task we only care about the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: For any complex number z, |sinh z| ≤ cosh(Re z). The Lean statement exactly captures this: `Complex.abs` is the complex absolute value, `Complex.sinh` is the complex hyperbolic sine, and `Real.cosh z.re` is cosh applied to the real part of z. There are no extra hypotheses or alterations.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, assuming sin z ≠ 0 and sin(Re z) ≠ 0, the absolute value of the reciprocal of sin z is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the reciprocal of sin(Re z). Equivalently, |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|, since csc is 1/sin. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original claim: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|.”
- The Lean version expresses exactly this inequality using Complex.abs and the reciprocal of Complex.sin. The added hypotheses `sin z ≠ 0` and `sin (Re z) ≠ 0` ensure that csc is well-defined (since csc = 1/sin), which is a standard and reasonable formalization detail. Also, using Complex.abs on the real input for the right-hand side is consistent because Complex.abs agrees with the real absolute value on real numbers.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement directly formalizes the intended inequality with the necessary domain restrictions.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical content matches: same objects (z ∈ ℂ), same functions (csc as 1/sin), same inequality direction. The only additions are the non-vanishing assumptions, which are natural to make the expressions meaningful in a formal setting. Hence, the translation is faithful.

  This states: For a complex number z with norm < 1, the principal complex logarithm satisfies log(1 − z) = − (tsum over n ∈ ℕ) of z^(n+1)/(n+1). The sum is written as a `tsum` over ℕ with the index shifted by n ↦ n+1, which is exactly the same as ∑_{k=1}^∞ z^k/k.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ with |z|<1, log(1−z) = −∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n. The Lean statement matches this precisely, with the standard reindexing of the series and explicit typing of (n+1) as a complex number.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only presentational difference is the reindexing of the series from starting at n=1 to an ℕ-indexed `tsum` with term at n being z^(n+1)/(n+1); these are mathematically equivalent.
- The Lean statement uses `Complex.log`, i.e., the principal branch; the natural statement did not specify a branch, but in standard usage and for |z|<1 this matches the usual identity with log(1)=0. No mismatch arises under the given hypothesis.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement stands as a faithful formalization.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: bring in Mathlib.
- `theorem arg_exp_extracted (z : ℂ) : (Complex.exp z).arg = z.im ∧ Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Complex.exp z.re := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, we assert two statements simultaneously:
  • Arg(exp z) = Im(z).
  • |exp z| = exp(Re(z)).
  However, in Lean's notation, there is a subtlety in the second equality: `Complex.abs (Complex.exp z)` is a real number, while the right-hand side is written as `Complex.exp z.re`, which is the complex exponential applied to the real number `z.re` (implicitly coerced into ℂ). This produces a complex number equal to e^{Re z} + 0i. Thus, as written, the right-hand side is of type ℂ, not ℝ, and mismatches the left-hand side's type ℝ. The faithful expression of the natural statement in Lean should use `Real.exp z.re` on the right-hand side, i.e., `Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re`.

2) Comparison to the original statement:
- First conjunct: `(Complex.exp z).arg = z.im` matches “Arg(e^z) = Im z.” This uses the standard principal argument `Complex.arg` (values in (-π, π]), consistent with the usual meaning of Arg in Mathlib.
- Second conjunct: The intended mathematical statement is “|e^z| = e^{Re z},” which in Lean should read `Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re`. The code, however, writes `Complex.exp z.re` instead of `Real.exp z.re`. This is a type-level and notational mismatch: the code’s RHS is complex, not real. So the formal statement in Lean is not a faithful encoding of the natural-language equality.

3) Final check:
- The first part is faithful.
- The second part is not faithfully translated due to using `Complex.exp` instead of `Real.exp`. This is a small but real discrepancy: the types differ and the proposition, as written, doesn’t match the natural-language statement (and would not typecheck in Lean). There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions, and the overall structure is correct, but this error prevents a fully faithful translation.

Conclusion: Almost correct, but not fully faithful due to the `Real.exp` vs `Complex.exp` issue in the second equality.

- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_15663 {z : ℂ} (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) :` sets up the statement: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, we will prove the following.
- `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ) ∧` states the first inequality: |log(1 - z)| ≤ Σ over n ∈ ℕ of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1). Since the sum is over n ≥ 0 but the term uses (n+1), this is exactly Σ_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k.
- `∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` states the second inequality: the same series is ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|).
- The whole conclusion is a conjunction `∧` of the two inequalities, matching the natural language chain of inequalities.
There are no auxiliary definitions; all symbols are standard Mathlib (Complex.abs, Complex.log, tsum ∑', ℝ coercions, powers).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The hypothesis |z| < 1 matches exactly.
- The middle series is written as a tsum over ℕ with an index shift (n+1), which is mathematically equivalent to Σ_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n in the statement.
- The first inequality |log(1 - z)| ≤ Σ_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n matches.
- The second inequality Σ_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|) matches.
- Use of Complex.log indicates the principal branch; the original statement did not specify a branch, but in this context for |z|<1 this is the standard interpretation and does not change the inequalities asserted. This is a standard acceptable formalization detail.
- Combining the two inequalities via conjunction ∧ instead of a chain is logically equivalent in content.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are the same. Indexing and types are consistent; the principal log is a standard choice; the inequalities are exactly as stated. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, standard.
- Comment: States the natural language goal exactly: Let z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1. Prove ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|).
- `theorem tsum_abs_pow_div_le (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry` declares the theorem for a complex number z with hypothesis |z| < 1.
- The statement: `∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (n+1 : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` is an inequality of real numbers (since `Complex.abs z : ℝ`), comparing the infinite sum on the left to |z|/(1 - |z|) on the right.
- The left-hand side uses `∑' (n : ℕ)` which is the `tsum` over n = 0,1,2,..., but the summand is indexed as `(n+1)`, so the series is ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1), which is exactly ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k via the change of variable k = n+1.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The domain (z ∈ ℂ) and hypothesis (|z| < 1) match exactly.
- The series being summed is precisely ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n, represented in Lean by shifting the index with n+1.
- The inequality bound |z|/(1 − |z|) matches exactly.
- The codomain is ℝ, appropriate since absolute value is real.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses `tsum` from 0 with `n+1` in the term, which is equivalent to the original sum from 1. No substantive difference.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions; no vacuous content. The only `sorry` is the proof, which is acceptable here since we are auditing the statement.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the full mathematical library, providing complex numbers, hyperbolic functions, absolute values, and the exponential function.
- `open scoped Real` opens real-number-specific notation; not essential here but harmless.
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_ext (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the absolute value of sinh z is less than or equal to (1/2) times e to the power of the absolute value of z. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_ext (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the absolute value of cosh z is less than or equal to (1/2) times e to the power of the absolute value of z. Again, proof omitted, but the statement is precise.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean code provides exactly these two inequalities as separate theorems, using standard Mathlib notions: Complex.abs for |·| on ℂ, Complex.sinh/Complex.cosh for hyperbolic functions, and Real.exp of Complex.abs z for e^{|z|}.
- Splitting into two theorems rather than a single conjunctive statement is perfectly faithful.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with omitted proofs, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorems exactly match the natural language inequalities, with correct domains and functions.
- No discrepancies in constants, domains, or function interpretations.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `open Complex`: Brings Complex-specific functions (like Complex.exp, Complex.sin, Complex.cos) into unqualified scope.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts for z ∈ ℂ that e^{\overline z} = \overline{e^z}, sin(\overline z) = \overline{\sin z}, and cos(\overline z) = \overline{\cos z}. The Lean theorems state exactly these three equalities, with `complex_conj` serving as the overline operation and `exp/sin/cos` as the complex exponential/sine/cosine. Splitting into three theorems is fine. The auxiliary definition `complex_conj` is non-vacuous and correctly implements conjugation.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No extraneous assumptions, no weakening/strengthening. The only difference is the explicit definition of conjugation rather than using a built-in name, which is faithful. Proofs are omitted, which is allowed here; the statements themselves match the original.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- def HolomorphicOn (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “f is holomorphic on U”, but it is vacuous (always true). This is a serious red flag: it does not encode holomorphicity.
- def discrete_set (s : Set ℂ) : Prop := ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ (s ∩ Metric.ball x δ) = {x}: Defines a set s to be discrete if each point of s has a neighborhood ball around it that intersects s only at that point. This is a legitimate and standard notion for a discrete subset of ℂ.
- theorem zeros_are_discrete {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} {c : ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : HolomorphicOn f U) : discrete_set ({z : ℂ | z ∈ U ∧ f z = c}) := by sorry: States that if U is open and f is holomorphic on U (as per the placeholder), then the set {z ∈ U | f z = c} is a discrete set. The statement matches the natural language claim about discreteness, modulo the placeholder for holomorphicity and the choice to model f as ℂ → ℂ with holomorphicity restricted to U.
- theorem local_factorization {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} {c p : ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : HolomorphicOn f U) (hp : p ∈ U) (hfp : f p = c) : ∃ δ : ℝ, ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, ∃ k : ℕ, 0 < δ ∧ HolomorphicOn g (Metric.ball p δ) ∧ (∀ z, z ∈ Metric.ball p δ → f z - c = (z - p) ^ k * g z) ∧ g p ≠ 0 := by sorry: States a local factorization at a zero p: there exist δ > 0, a function g, and an integer k ≥ 0 such that on the open ball around p of radius δ, f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z), g is holomorphic on that ball (again via the placeholder), and g(p) ≠ 0. This captures the intended Weierstrass preparation/isolated zero factorization. While it doesn’t explicitly say “g is not identically zero,” the condition g(p) ≠ 0 ensures it.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Content-wise, the two theorems align with the statement: the zero set is discrete, and there is a local factorization with a holomorphic g, g(p) ≠ 0, and some k ∈ ℕ. Using Metric.ball matches the open disk Δ_δ(p). Modeling f as ℂ → ℂ with holomorphic-on-U is a common formalization choice equivalent to f : U → ℂ being holomorphic.
- However, the critical issue: HolomorphicOn is defined as True, a vacuous placeholder. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be faithful and non-vacuous. Thus the holomorphicity assumption is not actually enforced by the code.
- The discrete_set definition is legitimate. The absence of an explicit “g is not identically zero” clause is acceptable since g(p) ≠ 0 implies that.

Final check: Are the problems the same?
- They would be essentially the same if HolomorphicOn were a proper Mathlib predicate (e.g., AnalyticOn ℂ f U or Complex.DifferentiableOn). But as written, with HolomorphicOn := True, the theorems are vacuously applicable to any f, so the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Because of the vacuous HolomorphicOn definition, the translation fails. If that were fixed to a legitimate holomorphic predicate, the theorems would be faithful to the natural language statement. Hence this is in the rubric category: makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, the final statements are faithful.

  theorem holomorphic_on_analytic (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) (hopen : IsOpen U)
    (h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) : AnalyticOn ℂ f U := by sorry
  Natural language: If U is an open subset of ℂ and f : ℂ → ℂ is complex-differentiable on U (i.e., differentiable over the scalar field ℂ at every point of U), then f is analytic on U (i.e., it admits a local complex power series expansion around every point of U that converges to f on some neighborhood).

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The original statement: Let U ⊂ ℂ be a domain and f : U → ℂ be holomorphic. Show that f is analytic on U; that is, f has a Taylor series expansion around each point with radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity, and the series sums to f.
- Comparison:
  - The Lean theorem covers: “holomorphic (differentiable) on U implies analytic on U.” It models holomorphic as DifferentiableOn ℂ f U and analytic as AnalyticOn ℂ f U, which is standard in Mathlib and captures the existence of a local power series that sums to f.
  - Differences:
    • Domain vs open: The NL assumes U is a domain (open and connected); the Lean code only assumes U is open. This is acceptable for the analytic-on-U conclusion, which does not require connectedness, but it does omit the “domain” hypothesis.
    • Function type: NL has f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability restricted to U. This is a standard formalization and essentially equivalent for the property stated.
    • Crucially, the NL statement includes an additional, stronger property: “radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity.” The Lean statement AnalyticOn ℂ f U guarantees local power series that converge to f but does not assert anything about the exact radius of convergence, let alone its equality to the distance to the nearest singularity. That part is not captured.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are different. The Lean code formalizes the weaker claim “holomorphic implies analytic” but does not formalize the stronger assertion about the radius of convergence being the distance to the nearest singularity. Also, the “domain” condition (connectedness) is unused. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the theorem is stated properly (though with a sorry proof), but it does not fully match the natural language statement.

Given these discrepancies, the translation is not faithful to the full content of the original statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem is named max_modulus_local_constant and concerns complex-valued functions on ℂ.
- U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, z0 : ℂ. So f is a function on the whole complex plane, but we will only assume holomorphy on U.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U. U is open in ℂ.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. f is complex differentiable (holomorphic in the usual sense) on U.
  - hz0 : z0 ∈ U. The point z0 lies in U.
  - hmax : ∃ r, 0 < r ∧ ball z0 r ⊆ U ∧ ∀ z ∈ ball z0 r, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖f z0‖. There exists r > 0 such that the open ball around z0 of radius r is contained in U and |f| attains a local maximum at z0 on that ball.
- Conclusion: ∃ r, 0 < r ∧ ∀ z ∈ ball z0 r, f z = f z0. There exists some radius r > 0 such that f is constant and equal to f z0 on the entire ball around z0 of radius r (as a subset of ℂ, not explicitly restricted to U).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic. If |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U, then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
- The code mirrors the assumptions faithfully:
  - U is open and z0 ∈ U.
  - f is holomorphic on U (expressed as DifferentiableOn ℂ f U), which is a standard formalization.
  - The local maximum condition is expressed via existence of a ball contained in U on which |f(z)| ≤ |f(z0)|.
- The conclusion in the NL statement is “f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.” In the formalization, the conclusion is that there exists r > 0 such that f is constant on the entire ball ball z0 r (without mentioning U). This asserts constancy on an open ball in ℂ, i.e., a neighborhood of z0 in ℂ, which certainly implies constancy on a neighborhood within U as well (since U is open, one could also pick a smaller ball contained in U). The Lean formulation takes f to be globally defined on ℂ but only holomorphic on U, a common formalization device.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Slight domain mismatch: NL has f : U → ℂ, while Lean has f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- Conclusion scope: The Lean conclusion does not explicitly require the ball to lie in U, making the statement slightly stronger (constancy on a ball in ℂ, not just on U ∩ ball). Since f is treated as a global function in the Lean statement, this is a natural slight generalization and still captures “constant in a neighborhood of z0.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable per the task.

Overall, the code is a faithful and slightly stronger formalization of the natural language statement. The only minor discrepancy is the absence of an explicit “⊆ U” in the conclusion, but given the global domain of f in the Lean statement, it still expresses the intended local constancy near z0 and is an acceptable generalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports Mathlib and opens namespaces. No issues here.
- The docstring states the classical holomorphic local factorization around a zero, but mentions f'(z0)=0 and counting preimages; this is not fully reflected in the theorem statement.
- The theorem jirilebl_zero_multiplicity_or_constant takes:
  • U : Set ℂ, hU : IsOpen U (so U is open, but no connectedness is assumed).
  • f : ℂ → ℂ with hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (so f is holomorphic on U but defined on all ℂ).
  • z0, c : ℂ with hz0 : z0 ∈ U and hfc : f z0 = c.
  Conclusion: either (∀ z ∈ U, f z = c), i.e., f is identically c on U, or there exist m ≥ 1, an open neighborhood V of z0 with V ⊆ U, and a holomorphic g on V with g z0 ≠ 0 such that for all z ∈ V,
    f z - c = (z - z0)^m * g z.
  There is no statement about the number of solutions of f(z) = c in V, and no mention of f'(z0) = 0.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Original hypotheses: U is a domain (open and connected subset of ℂ) and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant. The Lean theorem only assumes U is open (not necessarily connected) and does not assume nonconstancy.
- Crucial hypothesis missing: the original assumes f'(z0) = 0, but the Lean theorem has no derivative-at-z0 hypothesis.
- Original conclusion: either f ≡ c or z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicity). The Lean theorem concludes a local factorization f(z) − c = (z − z0)^m g(z) with g holomorphic and nonvanishing at z0 (i.e., z0 is a zero of order m), but does not state anything about counting the preimages of c in a neighborhood.
- The Lean theorem asserts m ≥ 1 in the non-constant branch, which aligns with having a zero of some positive order, but since it lacks f'(z0)=0, it allows m = 1 (simple zero), whereas the original context with f'(z0) = 0 would force m ≥ 2 when f is not constant.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- Differences:
  • Missing hypothesis f'(z0) = 0.
  • Missing connectedness (domain) assumption; only openness is assumed.
  • Missing explicit nonconstancy assumption (though the disjunction allows the constant case).
  • Missing the key conclusion about the cardinality of f^{-1}(c) ∩ V being exactly m (with multiplicity). The Lean statement only gives local factorization, not the counting conclusion.
  • Function is ℂ → ℂ instead of U → ℂ, though this is a benign generalization given DifferentiableOn on U.
- Because of the missing derivative hypothesis and the omitted preimage-counting conclusion, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement. It captures only the local factorization aspect of a zero of a holomorphic function, which is strictly weaker and also applies when f'(z0) ≠ 0 (yielding m = 1).

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem discrete_set_of_deriv_eq_zero {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ}`: We fix an open subset U of ℂ and a function f from ℂ to ℂ (to be used only on U).
- `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- `(h_nonconst : ¬ ∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c)`: f is not constant on U.
- Conclusion: `(∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z = 0 → ∃ r > 0, ∀ w, w ∈ U → dist w z < r → deriv f w = 0 → w = z)`. For every point z in U with derivative zero, there exists a radius r > 0 such that any point w in U with distance < r and with derivative zero must equal z. In other words, each zero of the derivative in U is isolated relative to U.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural statement asks to show that the set {z ∈ U : f'(z) = 0} is discrete in U, given that U is open, f is holomorphic, and f is not constant. In topological terms, discreteness of S ⊆ U means every point s ∈ S has a neighborhood in U intersecting S only at s.
- The code’s conclusion exactly encodes this property via metric balls: for each z with deriv f z = 0, there is r > 0 such that (Ball(z, r) ∩ U) contains no other points of the zero set besides z. This is the standard metric characterization of a discrete subset of U.
- Representing f as a function on ℂ with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` is a standard formalization of “f : U → ℂ is holomorphic”. The non-constancy condition is expressed precisely on U.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions; the theorem statement directly matches the intended mathematical claim.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the claim that the critical set {z ∈ U | f'(z) = 0} is discrete in U under the given hypotheses. The use of `dist` and quantification over `w ∈ U` gives the correct relative (in U) discreteness. The only cosmetic difference is defining f on ℂ rather than U, together with `DifferentiableOn` on U; this is a standard and faithful formalization choice.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, p f' : ℂ. So U is an open subset of ℂ, f is a function from ℂ to ℂ, p is a point, and f' is a complex number intended to be the derivative at p.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U means U is open.
  - hf : HasDerivAt f f' p means f is complex differentiable at p with derivative f'.
  - hpU : p ∈ U means p is in U.
  - h : f' ≠ 0 means the derivative at p is nonzero.
- Conclusion: There exists a set V ⊆ ℂ such that:
  - V ⊆ U
  - IsOpen V (V is open)
  - p ∈ V (V is a neighborhood of p)
  - ∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y (f is injective on V)
  - IsOpen (f '' V) (the image f(V) is open in ℂ)

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ is holomorphic; f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that f(V) is open and f|_V is injective.

Matches:
- U is open (hU) and p ∈ U (hpU).
- The conclusion exactly asks for an open neighborhood V of p contained in U, injectivity of f on V, and openness of f(V). The Lean statement encodes injectivity by a quantifier and openness by IsOpen (f '' V), and explicitly requires V ⊆ U, which is consistent since in the informal statement f is only defined on U.
- The nonzero derivative at p is represented by hf together with h: f' ≠ 0.

Differences / Issues:
- Domain of f: The natural statement has f : U → ℂ, while the Lean code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with V ⊆ U. This is a benign generalization and is fine by itself.
- Crucial mismatch: The natural statement assumes f is holomorphic on U (i.e., complex differentiable on an open set containing p). The Lean code only assumes HasDerivAt f f' p, i.e., differentiable at the single point p. It does not assume holomorphic/differentiable on any neighborhood of p or on U. This is a significant weakening of the hypothesis and is not faithful to the original statement.
- The existence of a derivative at p alone generally does not suffice for the local injectivity/open mapping conclusions; the holomorphic (or at least differentiable in a neighborhood) assumption is essential. So the Lean statement does not faithfully capture the natural language assumptions.

3) Final check:
They are different problems: the Lean statement removes the key ""f is holomorphic on U"" assumption and replaces it with merely ""f has a derivative at p."" The rest of the conclusion matches, and V ⊆ U is consistent. However, because the main analytic hypothesis is weakened, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions; the quantifiers and conclusions align well; but the omission of holomorphic-on-U is a major discrepancy. Hence not faithful; score 8 reflects that it is close but misses a central hypothesis.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem analytic_eq_of_agreement_on_set_with_accum {U S : Set Complex} {f g : Complex → Complex}`: We consider sets U, S ⊆ ℂ and functions f, g: ℂ → ℂ.
- `(hU : IsOpen U)`: U is open.
- `(hf : AnalyticOn Complex f U) (hg : AnalyticOn Complex g U)`: f and g are analytic (holomorphic) on U.
- `(hS : S ⊆ U)`: S is a subset of U.
- `(ha : ∃ a, a ∈ U ∧ a ∈ closure (S \ {a}))`: There exists a point a ∈ U such that a is in the closure of S \ {a}; i.e., a is an accumulation point of S lying in U.

- Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z`: f and g agree everywhere on U (i.e., f ≡ g on U).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- U open, f and g holomorphic on U: `IsOpen U` and `AnalyticOn ℂ f U`, `AnalyticOn ℂ g U` match “holomorphic on U” in complex analysis (AnalyticOn over ℂ corresponds to holomorphic).
- S ⊆ U and has an accumulation point in U: `hS : S ⊆ U` and `∃ a ∈ U, a ∈ closure (S \ {a})` exactly encode that S has a limit point a in U. Using ambient closure is appropriate; since a ∈ U and U is open, this matches the usual notion of accumulation point in U.
- Agreement on S: `∀ z ∈ S, f z = g z` matches.
- Conclusion f ≡ g on U: `∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z` matches.

3) Final comparison and possible differences:
- The code uses functions f, g defined on ℂ rather than on U, but restricts analyticity to U via `AnalyticOn`; this is a standard and faithful formalization of “f, g : U → ℂ are holomorphic.”
- The notion of accumulation point is captured correctly by `a ∈ closure (S \ {a})` with a ∈ U.
- Both the natural language statement and the Lean statement conclude equality on all of U without assuming U is connected; this is stronger than the standard identity theorem but the formalization faithfully mirrors the given (possibly over-strong) natural language.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- Lean: U open, f : ℂ → ℂ but only assumed analytic on U (i.e., holomorphic on U), nonconstant on U (existence of two points in U with different images), conclude that the restriction of f to U is an open map. This is a standard formalization (using a global f restricted to U via `Subtype U`). It matches the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain presentation: natural language has f : U → ℂ; Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ restricted to U via `Subtype U`. These are equivalent in meaning for this context.
- Holomorphic vs AnalyticOn: `AnalyticOn ℂ` is exactly holomorphic in Mathlib.
- Nonconstant: both mean existence of two points in U with distinct images.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `injOn_ball_of_deriv_ne_zero` is stated for a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, a point `p : ℂ`, an open set `U : Set ℂ`, and a radius `δ : ℝ`.
- Assumptions:
  - `hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`: f is holomorphic (complex differentiable) on U.
  - `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `hp : p ∈ U`: p is in U.
  - `hf' : deriv f p ≠ 0`: the complex derivative of f at p (as a function on ℂ) is nonzero.
  - `hδ : 0 < δ`: δ is a positive real number.
- Conclusion: `InjOn f (ball p δ)`: f is injective on the open Euclidean ball of radius δ around p (in the whole ℂ).

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let U ⊂ ℂ be open and f : U → ℂ holomorphic. If p ∈ U and f'(p) ≠ 0, then for sufficiently small δ > 0, f restricted to Δ_δ(p) is injective.
- Key aspects:
  - Domain of f is U (not all of ℂ). Typically, one expects the disc Δ_δ(p) to be taken small enough so that Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U.
  - ""For sufficiently small δ > 0"" means there exists δ₀ > 0 such that for all 0 < δ ≤ δ₀, f is injective on Δ_δ(p). This is equivalent to ""there exists some δ > 0 such that f is injective on Δ_δ(p)"", since injectivity persists when restricting to smaller balls.

3) Discrepancies:
- Quantifiers on δ: The Lean statement takes an arbitrary δ with `0 < δ` and concludes injectivity on `ball p δ`. This is a universal quantifier (for that given δ), which is much stronger than the intended existential/sufficiently-small quantification. The natural statement is ""there exists δ > 0 (and in fact for all smaller δ)""; the Lean code effectively asserts ""for any δ > 0"".
- Relation to U: The Lean conclusion is injectivity on `ball p δ` in ℂ with no requirement that `ball p δ ⊆ U`. In the original statement, f is only defined on U, so one must ensure the disc lies in U. The Lean code avoids this by taking f : ℂ → ℂ, but that changes the problem and leads to a different, stronger claim without assuming anything about f outside U.
- Type of derivative: Using `deriv f p` (ambient derivative) versus a derivative within U is acceptable here because U is assumed open and `DifferentiableOn` on U plus `p ∈ U` implies differentiability at p in the ambient sense. So this part is fine.

4) Overall judgment:
- The Lean theorem is not a faithful translation. It asserts injectivity on any positive-radius ball (and not just sufficiently small ones) and does not ensure the ball is contained in U, whereas the natural language assumes f is only defined on U and requires a small ball within U. These are substantial mismatches.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: U : Set Complex, f : Complex → Complex, p : Complex.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U, hconn : IsConnected U. This matches “U is open and connected.”
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This formalizes “f is holomorphic on U.”

  - hp : p ∈ U.
- Conclusion:
  - ∃ δ > 0, ∀ s : Set Complex, IsOpen s → s ⊆ (Metric.ball p δ \ {p}) → IsOpen (f '' s).
  - In words: there exists δ > 0 such that for every subset s of the punctured disk around p which is open in the ambient Complex topology, the image f '' s is open in Complex.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For U ⊆ ℂ open and connected, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant, and p ∈ U, there exists δ > 0 such that the restriction of f to Δ_δ(p) \ {p} is an open map. Interpreted precisely, this means: there is δ > 0 with Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U so that for every set s that is open in the subspace topology of Δ_δ(p) \ {p}, the image of s under f (restricted to U) is open in ℂ.

Discrepancies:
1) Domain/restriction mismatch: The original has f : U → ℂ and implicitly requires Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U (or uses s ⊆ U ∩ Δ_δ(p) \ {p}). The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U but does not require s ⊆ U or Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U. It asserts the openness conclusion for any s ⊆ Δ_δ(p) \ {p}, even points outside U where no holomorphy is assumed. This is strictly stronger than the intended result and not faithful to the domain restriction.
2) Topology of “open map”: The original “restriction is an open map” means: for every open subset in the subspace topology of Δ_δ(p) \ {p}. The Lean code requires s to be open in the ambient ℂ (IsOpen s), which is more restrictive than being open in the subspace topology. Thus the Lean lemma states a weaker property than being an open map on the subspace.

Other aspects:
- The expression of nonconstancy on U via ∃ x y ∈ U, f x ≠ f y is appropriate.
- Using Metric.ball p δ for Δ_δ(p) is standard and fine.

Final check:
- Because of (1) lack of restriction to U (or Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U) and (2) using ambient openness rather than subspace openness, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous placeholders; hypotheses mostly align. However, the conclusion has two substantive mismatches (domain restriction and subspace vs ambient openness). This is a significant but fixable divergence. Hence a mid-to-high score but not faithful.

- The Lean statement precisely formalizes “zero of finite order” via the existence of n ≥ 1 and an analytic g with g(z₀) ≠ 0 and the local factorization f'(z) = (z - z₀)^n g(z) in a neighborhood of z₀. The hypothesis “¬ ∀ z ∈ U, f z = f z₀” is exactly “f is not constant on U.” The derivative at z₀ is assumed to be 0. Everything aligns with the usual definition.
- The statement quantifies over all z with dist z z₀ < r without explicitly stating that ball(z₀, r) ⊆ U. Since U is open and z₀ ∈ U, one can choose r so that the ball is contained in U; hence the universal quantification is still correct. This is a standard and acceptable formalization detail.

3) Final comparison:
- Both problems assert the same mathematical content: under the given hypotheses, f' has a zero at z₀ of finite order, formalized by the existence of n ≥ 1 and the local factorization with an analytic, nonvanishing g. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; all Mathlib notions are standard. The formalization is faithful.

  • Let U ⊆ ℂ be a set, p ∈ ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, and suppose f is complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic on U). Assume U is open and p ∈ U. Assume the complex derivative of f at p is nonzero: deriv f p ≠ 0. Then there exists a set V that is a neighborhood of p (i.e., V ∈ 𝓝 p) such that f is injective on V (InjOn f V).

Assessment of alignment with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open, p ∈ U, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p (implicitly V ⊆ U since f : U → ℂ) such that the restriction of f to V is injective.
- Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with the hypothesis `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, which is the standard Mathlib way to formalize a holomorphic function on an open subset U. This faithfully captures “f : U → ℂ is holomorphic”.
- The derivative condition is `deriv f p ≠ 0`, which matches f'(p) ≠ 0 in the complex sense. Since deriv is 0 when not differentiable, this also implies differentiability at p.
- Conclusion differences:
  • Lean states existence of V with V ∈ 𝓝 p (a neighborhood of p, not necessarily open) and InjOn f V, but does not explicitly require V ⊆ U or that V is open.
  • However, V ∈ 𝓝 p means there exists an open W with p ∈ W ⊆ V. Injectivity is hereditary under restriction: if InjOn f V, then InjOn f W for any W ⊆ V. Since U is open and p ∈ U, W ∩ U is also an open neighborhood of p contained in U, and injOn still holds on W ∩ U. Thus the Lean conclusion implies the natural language conclusion. Conversely, the natural language conclusion (an open V ⊆ U) trivially implies the Lean conclusion (take that V, which is in 𝓝 p). Hence the formulations are equivalent in content.
- The presence of `hU : IsOpen U` and `hp : p ∈ U` matches the natural statement and is exactly what is needed to refine from a general neighborhood to an open neighborhood inside U.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib ones. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing the statement translation.

Final check: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given statement. Minor presentational differences (neighborhood vs open neighborhood, f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn U vs f : U → ℂ) are standard and do not change the mathematical meaning, given the included hypotheses.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. f : ℂ → ℂ with hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (so f is holomorphic on U), and h states f is nonconstant on U: ¬∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c.
- α : ℝ → ℂ with hα : ContinuousOn α (Icc a b), hα' : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, α t ∈ U (so the image of α on [a,b] lies in U), and hα0 : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, α' t ≠ 0 (nonvanishing derivative of α on [a,b]; here α' denotes the derivative function of α in mathlib notation).
- Claim: StrictMonoOn (arg ∘ f ∘ α) (Icc a b) ↔ [three conditions]:
  (i) ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, HasDerivAt α (α' t) t (i.e., α is differentiable at every t with derivative α' t),
  (ii) ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, HasDerivAt f (f' (α t)) (α t) (i.e., f has complex derivative f'(α t) at α t), and
  (iii) ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, (f'(α t) * α'(t)).arg = 0 (i.e., the argument of the product f'(α(t))·α'(t) is equal to 0 for all t).
- The proof is omitted (:= by sorry), as requested.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant; α : [a,b] → U is smooth with α'(t) ≠ 0 for all t ∈ [a,b]. Then f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a,b] iff arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) is constant on [a,b].

Discrepancies:
- Domain of f: The natural statement has f : U → ℂ; the Lean statement uses f : ℂ → ℂ together with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This can be acceptable as a common formalization trick.
- Regularity of α: Natural statement assumes α is smooth on [a,b]. Lean code assumes α is continuous on [a,b] and then places the differentiability of α as part of the right-hand side of the equivalence (as a conjunct). This changes the logical structure: in the natural statement, differentiability is a hypothesis; in the Lean statement, it becomes part of the condition equivalent to strict monotonicity.
- Regularity of f: Similarly, the Lean statement includes as part of the right-hand side the pointwise HasDerivAt for f at α t, which is again placed inside the equivalence rather than as a standing hypothesis. The natural statement assumes holomorphic on U globally from the outset.
- The key condition about argument: Natural statement says “arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) is constant on [a,b]” (constant but not necessarily 0). The Lean code requires (f'(α t) * α' t).arg = 0 for all t, i.e., the argument is specifically equal to 0 everywhere, not just constant. This is a major change (far too strong and not equivalent to “is constant”).
- The notion of “changes argument strictly monotonically”: The natural statement refers to the argument of f ∘ α along the curve, which typically means a continuous determination of the argument along the path. The Lean code uses StrictMonoOn (arg ∘ f ∘ α), where arg is the principal argument (with jumps at ±π). This is generally not the same as the “argument along the path” in complex analysis, and can fail due to discontinuities of the principal branch; hence this is a conceptual mismatch.
- Placement/role of α'(t) ≠ 0: The Lean statement includes hα0 as a hypothesis, which is fine, but since differentiability of α is not assumed in the hypotheses, α' t may be ill-posed; moreover, they then restate differentiability as part of the RHS. This is logically awkward and departs from the clean hypothesis in the natural statement.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is not faithful:
  - It replaces “arg is constant” with “arg equals 0 everywhere.”
  - It moves differentiability assumptions into the RHS of the equivalence rather than keeping them as hypotheses, changing the logical content.
  - It uses the principal arg function directly, which likely does not match the intended notion of argument variation along a path in the natural statement.
  - Overall, the equivalence in Lean is strictly stronger and differently structured than the original proposition.

Given these discrepancies, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem analyticAt_of_differentiableOn_ext {U : Set ℂ} : IsOpen U → ∀ {f : ℂ → ℂ}, DifferentiableOn ℂ f U → ∀ {z₀ : ℂ}, z₀ ∈ U → AnalyticAt ℂ f z₀ := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let U be a subset of ℂ. If U is open and f : ℂ → ℂ is complex-differentiable on U, then for every point z₀ ∈ U, f is analytic at z₀ (i.e., there exists a power series centered at z₀ that sums to f on some neighborhood of z₀). The proof is omitted (`by sorry`). There are no auxiliary definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions: IsOpen, DifferentiableOn, AnalyticAt.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: If f : U → ℂ is holomorphic on a domain U ⊆ ℂ, then f is analytic. More explicitly, for each z₀ ∈ U, f has a Taylor series that converges in the disk { z : |z − z₀| < R }, where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum equals f.
- The Lean statement captures the core part “holomorphic on an open set implies analytic at each point” (AnalyticAt). It also implicitly includes that the series sums to f on some neighborhood (that’s built into AnalyticAt in Mathlib). It generalizes from “domain” (open and connected) to “open set,” which is acceptable and does not change the local analyticity claim.
- However, the Lean statement does not include the additional assertion about the radius of convergence being equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞). That part is a significant extra claim in the natural language statement, and it is absent from the Lean code.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: holomorphic (DifferentiableOn over ℂ) on an open set implies analytic (AnalyticAt) at each point; the power series sums to f locally.
- Different: The natural language statement additionally specifies the precise radius of convergence (distance to nearest singularity). The Lean code does not state anything about the radius of convergence or singularities. Also, the natural statement assumes a “domain” (open and connected) whereas the Lean code only requires openness—this is a harmless generalization for the local analyticity claim.

Conclusion: The Lean code formalizes only the first (core) part of the statement (holomorphic implies analytic), omitting the radius-of-convergence characterization. Therefore it is not a fully faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem is named `local_inverse_holomorphic` and works over ℂ.
- Parameters: U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, p : ℂ.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U, i.e., U is open in ℂ.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, i.e., f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
  - hp : p ∈ U, i.e., p is a point in U.
  - hder : ∃ f' : ℂ, HasDerivAt f f' p ∧ f' ≠ 0, i.e., f has a complex derivative at p and it is nonzero.
- Conclusion: There exist sets V, W ⊆ ℂ and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that:
  - IsOpen V and IsOpen W: V and W are open.
  - p ∈ V and f p ∈ W: they are neighborhoods of p and f(p).
  - Set.BijOn f V W: the restriction of f maps V bijectively onto W.
  - ∀ y ∈ W, g y ∈ V ∧ f (g y) = y: g maps W into V and is a right-inverse to f on W.
  - ∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x: g is a left-inverse to f on V.
  - DifferentiableOn ℂ g W: g is holomorphic on W.
Thus, g is the inverse of f restricted to V → W, and this inverse is holomorphic on W.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, p ∈ U with f'(p) ≠ 0. Then there exist neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p) such that f : V → W is a bijection and f^{-1} is holomorphic.

The Lean version captures:
- U is open (hU), f is holomorphic on U (hf), p ∈ U (hp), and f'(p) ≠ 0 (hder).
- Existence of open neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p), with f being bijective from V onto W (Set.BijOn), and the inverse function g being holomorphic on W. The two inverse identities ensure g is precisely the inverse of f|_V.
- Using DifferentiableOn ℂ as the formalization of holomorphic is standard in Mathlib.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Primary minor discrepancy: The code does not impose V ⊆ U. In the natural statement, since f is defined only on U, for f : V → W to make sense one implicitly needs V ⊆ U. In the Lean code f is a global function ℂ → ℂ, with holomorphy only assumed on U, so the statement is slightly more general in form. This is a common formalization strategy and does not change the essence of the theorem; one could always replace V by V ∩ U. No other substantive discrepancies.
- All notions (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn, HasDerivAt, BijOn) are standard Mathlib definitions; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.
- The existence of an inverse and its holomorphy are explicitly encoded via g and the inverse identities plus DifferentiableOn g W.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation, with a minor generalization (V not explicitly required to be contained in U). This does not materially alter the mathematical meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Filter` and `open Metric` just set up the environment and namespaces.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem isClosed_iff_seq_limit {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] (S : Set X) :

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S.
- The Lean statement is exactly the formalization: it quantifies over all sequences in S and all points a, and asserts that if the sequence converges to a, then a ∈ S. This captures “every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S.” The use of Tendsto x atTop (nhds a) is precisely “x converges to a in X.” The iff with IsClosed S matches the closedness equivalence.
- The universal quantification over all a is equivalent to asserting that if the sequence converges (to its unique limit in a metric space), then that limit belongs to S. This is standard and faithful in metric spaces (Hausdorff), where limits are unique, so this formulation is not a problematic strengthening.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement directly matches the natural language statement.
- No mismatch in quantifiers or structures: metric space, closed set, sequences, convergence, and limits all align.
- Therefore, the two problems are the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- The conditional form (→) matches the “Suppose ... then ...” structure.

3) Final check for differences:

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem tendsto_norm_nhds_iff_lim_at_top (z0 : ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) :` Introduces a theorem for a complex point z0 and a function f : ℂ → ℂ.
- `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (𝓝 z0) atTop ↔ ...` This states that the norm of f(z) tends to infinity along the neighborhood filter at z0 (i.e., as z → z0 with z allowed to be equal to z0) is equivalent to the right-hand side condition.
- `∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, dist z z0 < δ → M < ‖f z‖` An ε-δ style condition: for every M > 0 there is δ > 0 such that for all z with dist(z,z0) < δ, we have M < ‖f z‖. Note: this does not exclude z = z0.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural language claim: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z − z0| < δ.”
- In the standard topological/complex-analytic setting, “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere” uses the punctured neighborhood filter 𝓝[≠] z0 (z approaching z0 but z ≠ z0), so it is independent of the value f(z0). Equivalently, one expects Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop.
- The ε-δ formulation should likewise exclude the point z0, i.e., require 0 < |z − z0| < δ, since including z = z0 would force ‖f z0‖ to be arbitrarily large, which is impossible for f : ℂ → ℂ.

Step 3: Are they the same?
- The Lean code uses (𝓝 z0), not the punctured (𝓝[≠] z0). This is a significant mismatch: it requires the behavior including z = z0, which is strictly stronger and typically false unless f(z0) is undefined or one works in an extended codomain with special conventions. Here f : ℂ → ℂ is everywhere defined and has finite norm at z0, so the left side of the equivalence is not the standard notion of “limit to ∞”.
- The ε-δ side in the code lacks the exclusion z ≠ z0 (i.e., it does not include 0 < dist z z0). This again imposes an impossible condition at z0.
- The docstring claims the left side corresponds to the Riemann-sphere limit to ∞, but the filter used is wrong for that purpose.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. It should use Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop and the ε-δ condition should include 0 < dist z z0.

- `theorem local_injective_of_deriv_ne_zero {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) {p : ℂ} (hp : p ∈ U) (h : deriv f p ≠ 0) : ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ V ∩ U → y ∈ V ∩ U → f x = f y → x = y)`
  Natural language: If f is complex-differentiable on U, and p ∈ U with derivative f'(p) ≠ 0 (here using `deriv f p`), then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that f is injective on V ∩ U.
  Comments: This faithfully captures “f is locally injective at all points where f′(p) ≠ 0.” The statement is per-point (as is standard for local assertions) and asserts injectivity of f on a neighborhood intersected with U, which is the correct notion for a function known to be holomorphic on U. While the code does not assume U is open here, within the original context (U open), `deriv f p` is the usual complex derivative; moreover, in mathlib `deriv f p ≠ 0` implies differentiability at p, and together with `hp : p ∈ U` and `hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, this is coherent. The result is slightly more general than the natural statement but is compatible with it and does not weaken it.

Whole translation faithfulness:
- Part 1 (open mapping) exactly matches: U open and connected; f holomorphic on U and nonconstant on U; conclusion f(U) is open. 
- Part 2 (local injectivity) matches the intended claim: at any p with nonzero derivative, f is locally injective (on a neighborhood intersected with U). The Lean statement is a standard and acceptable formalization. The generality (not requiring U open/connected or f nonconstant) is harmless and aligns with the mathematical truth.

Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain modeling: f : ℂ → ℂ vs f : U → ℂ. The code consistently restricts to U via `DifferentiableOn` and `f '' U`, so this is faithful.
- Nonconstancy: correctly restricted to U.
- Local injectivity: the code’s quantification over a single p is standard; the natural statement’s “at all points” is obtained by applying the theorem for each p.
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions. All terms used are standard mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement, with acceptable and standard formalization choices.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- `theorem exists_compact_seq_with_closed_ball_cover {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) :` 
  Interprets: Let U be an open subset of ℂ.
- `∃ (K : ℕ → Set ℂ),` 
  There exists a sequence (indexed by ℕ) of sets K n in ℂ.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n)) ∧` 
  For all n, K n is compact.
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n + 1))) ∧` 
  For all n, K n is contained in the interior of K (n+1).
- `U = ⋃ n, interior (K n) ∧` 
  U equals the union over n of the interiors of K n.
- `∀ n, ∃ s : Finset (ℂ × ℝ),` 
  For each n, there exists a finite set s of pairs (center, radius) in ℂ × ℝ.
- `K n ⊆ (⋃ p ∈ s, Metric.closedBall p.fst p.snd) ∧ (⋃ p ∈ s, Metric.closedBall p.fst p.snd) ⊆ interior (K (n + 1))` 
  Such that K n is contained in the union of finitely many closed balls (disks) and this union is contained in interior(K (n+1)).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: For open U ⊂ ℂ, there exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U with:
- K_n ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘,
- U = ⋃_{n=1}^∞ K_n^∘,
- For each n, there is a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊂ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘.

Matches:
- U is assumed open in both.
- Existence of a sequence K_n with each K_n compact: matches.
- The inclusion K_n ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}) and U = ⋃ interior(K_n): matches (index shift ℕ starting at 0 vs n ≥ 1 is a harmless convention change).
- Finite union of closed disks covering K_n and contained in interior(K_{n+1}): matches; Lean uses Finset of centers and radii with Metric.closedBall, which corresponds to closed disks.

Discrepancy:
- The original requires that each K_n is a compact subset of U (i.e., K_n ⊆ U). The Lean statement does not include K n ⊆ U anywhere. From U = ⋃ interior(K n), one can deduce interior(K n) ⊆ U for all n, but K n itself may contain points outside U (with empty interior), so this is strictly weaker than “K_n ⊆ U”. Thus the Lean statement is missing a key hypothesis/requirement.
- Minor notational points are acceptable: non-strict vs strict inclusion (⊆ vs ⊂), index starting at 0, and allowing radii in ℝ (existential allows choosing nonnegative radii anyway).

Step 3: Final check
The Lean code is very close but not fully faithful: it omits the requirement K_n ⊆ U. Therefore the formal statement is weaker than the original. No vacuous placeholders are used; all terms are standard Mathlib. Given the single substantive omission, this is “almost the same but not faithful.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines just bring Mathlib and notations into scope; no mathematical content change.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem tendsto_cocompact_iff_tac_3498 (f : ℂ → ℂ) (L : ℂ) :
   Tendsto f (cocompact ℂ) (𝓝 L) ↔ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ M, ∀ z, M < Complex.abs z → dist (f z) L < ε := by sorry`
  In words: For a function `f : ℂ → ℂ` and a complex number `L`, we have that `f` tends to `L` along the filter `cocompact ℂ` (i.e., as `z → ∞` in ℂ, the Riemann sphere sense) if and only if for every `ε > 0` there exists a real number `M` such that for all `z : ℂ`, if `M < |z|` then `dist (f z) L < ε`.
  Here `Complex.abs z` is `|z|` (the Euclidean norm), and `dist (f z) L` on ℂ equals `|f(z) - L|`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- ""lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere"" is formalized as `Tendsto f (cocompact ℂ) (𝓝 L)`, which captures the notion of approaching infinity on ℂ via the cocompact filter (eventually outside compact sets), exactly the Riemann-sphere/one-point compactification notion.
- The right-hand side `∀ ε > 0, ∃ M, ∀ z, M < |z| → dist (f z) L < ε` matches ""for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M"". The strict inequality `M < |z|` is the same as `|z| > M`, and `dist (f z) L` is `|f(z) − L|` in ℂ.
- The code assumes `L : ℂ`, matching the statement ""Suppose L ∈ ℂ"".

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The theorem statement is an exact formalization of the given statement: limit at infinity (Riemann sphere sense) iff the epsilon–M tail condition outside a large radius.
- No generalization or specialization beyond the original; it is faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard analysis library.
- Definition `is_conditionally_convergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`:
  This defines “the series ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent” to mean precisely that the series ∑ a_n converges (is summable) but the series of absolute values ∑ |a_n| does not converge (is not summable). This is the standard definition.
- Theorem `conditional_terms_not_abs_summable (a : ℕ → ℝ) (h : is_conditionally_convergent a) : ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`:
  Assuming the series is conditionally convergent as just defined, conclude that the series of absolute values is not summable. This is exactly the second component of the definition.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: Suppose ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent. Show that the terms a_n do not tend to zero “fast enough” to ensure absolute convergence.
- The phrase “do not tend to zero fast enough to ensure absolute convergence” is colloquial for “the series does not converge absolutely,” i.e., ∑ |a_n| is not summable. The code formalizes conditional convergence exactly as “convergent but not absolutely convergent,” and the theorem extracts the conclusion “not absolutely summable.”
- Thus, the Lean statement precisely captures the intended mathematical meaning: from conditional convergence, absolute convergence fails.

Final check: same or different?
- Same. The auxiliary definition is legitimate (no vacuous placeholders), using standard Mathlib notions. The theorem directly states the needed conclusion.
- Minor note: the informal phrasing about “tend to zero fast enough” is interpretive, but the formal content is exactly “not absolutely summable,” which the code states.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for a sequence a : ℕ → Complex (intended as power series coefficients), a function f : Complex → Complex, and a real R with 1 < R.
- h_coeff: there exists M ≥ 0 such that for all n, |a n| ≤ M * (R⁻¹)^n. This is a standard coefficient bound ensuring the power series has radius of convergence at least R (> 1).
- h_series: for all z with |z| ≤ 1, the series ∑ a n z^n converges (HasSum) to f z. Thus f is represented on the closed unit disk by the power series with coefficients a.
- h_a0: a 0 = f 0 (which follows from h_series at z = 0, but is stated explicitly).
- h_f0: f 0 ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: There exists a constant C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and all z with |z| ≤ 1, we have |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (a k / a 0) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and f(0) ≠ 0, then there exists C with |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0))) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1} for all m and |z| ≤ 1.
- The Lean code recasts ""holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk"" as: there exists a power series with radius > 1 (via hR and h_coeff) that equals f on |z| ≤ 1 (h_series). This is a standard, equivalent analytic formulation in this context. The coefficient bound h_coeff is a standard consequence of holomorphy on a larger disk (Cauchy estimates), so it’s not a vacuous or artificial assumption; it encodes the radius-of-convergence control explicitly.
- The sum in the conclusion uses (a k / a 0) instead of f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0)). Under h_series, the a k are exactly the Taylor coefficients of f at 0, i.e., a k = f^{(k)}(0)/k!, and h_a0 identifies a 0 with f 0. So the summand matches the original expression.
- Domain of quantification (m ∈ ℕ, |z| ≤ 1) and the form of the bound (C |z|^{m+1}) match exactly. The constant C is existential with no positivity constraint in the statement, which is harmless and consistent with the natural language.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- Differences are only in presentation of hypotheses: the Lean code uses an explicit power series representation with a coefficient decay bound and equality to f on the closed unit disk, which is a standard way to formalize ""holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk"" and is slightly more explicit/structured but mathematically equivalent for this purpose.
- No vacuous placeholders; all notions (HasSum, Complex.abs, Finset.sum) are from Mathlib. No auxiliary fake definitions.
- Conclusion precisely matches the intended inequality when interpreting a k as the Taylor coefficients.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.comap (fun z => ‖z‖) Filter.atTop) (nhds L) ↔ ...` This states: f tends to L along the filter obtained by pulling back the atTop filter on ℝ via the map z ↦ ‖z‖; i.e., as the norm ‖z‖ → ∞. That is the standard “limit as z → ∞” notion (and in ℂ this coincides with the Riemann sphere/one-point compactification notion at ∞, since ℂ is proper and cocompact = comap norm atTop).
- `∀ ε > 0, ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : ℂ, M < ‖z‖ → dist (f z) L < ε` This is exactly the epsilon–M formulation: for every ε > 0 there exists M such that whenever |z| > M, we have |f(z) − L| < ε. In Mathlib, `dist (f z) L` on ℂ equals `‖f z - L‖`.

2) Whole translation vs natural statement:
The natural statement says: “Suppose L ∈ ℂ. Show that lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M.” The Lean statement asserts exactly the equivalence between the limit along the ‘z → ∞’ filter and the epsilon–M criterion. In ℂ, ‘in the sense of the Riemann sphere’ corresponds to the cocompact filter at ∞, which equals `Filter.comap (fun z => ‖z‖) Filter.atTop` because ℂ is a proper metric space; hence the left-hand side is indeed the Riemann sphere sense. The right-hand side is the usual epsilon–M condition with |·| interpreted as norm and `dist`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code uses `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.comap (fun z => ‖z‖) Filter.atTop) (nhds L)` instead of explicitly mentioning the Riemann sphere. This is equivalent in ℂ (proper space), so it faithfully captures “limit at ∞ in the Riemann sphere sense.”
- It uses `dist (f z) L` in place of `|f(z) − L|`, which is identical in ℂ.
- The inequality is written as `M < ‖z‖` rather than `‖z‖ > M`; these are the same.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib constructs.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- def IsAnalytic (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True
  This defines a predicate IsAnalytic that is always true for any function f: ℂ → ℂ. It is explicitly a placeholder and does not capture holomorphy/analyticity.

- def Conformal (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := Function.Bijective f ∧ IsAnalytic f ∧ ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Function.LeftInverse g f ∧ IsAnalytic g
  This defines Conformal f to mean: f is a bijection ℂ → ℂ, f is “analytic” (but this predicate is vacuous), and there exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ such that g ∘ f = id (left inverse) and g is “analytic” (again vacuous). Note this encodes global bijectivity from ℂ onto ℂ, not merely a bijection onto the image. It also requires a left inverse on all of ℂ, not an inverse defined only on the image.

- theorem conformal_of_analytic_injective {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : IsAnalytic f) (hf_inj : Function.Injective f) : Conformal f := by sorry
  The theorem claims: if f is analytic (using the vacuous predicate) and injective, then f is Conformal in the above (global) sense. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the type checks.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Original statement: If f: ℂ → ℂ is analytic and injective, then f is a conformal mapping (holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse) onto its image.
- Problems:
  1) The code’s IsAnalytic is vacuous (always True), so it does not model “analytic/holomorphic”. This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders.
  2) The code’s Conformal requires f to be a bijection from ℂ onto ℂ, whereas the natural statement only asserts a bijection onto its image (i.e., injective with a holomorphic inverse defined on the image). The code overstrengthens the conclusion to global bijectivity.
  3) The existence of g: ℂ → ℂ with g ∘ f = id requires g to be defined on all of ℂ. The natural statement requires an inverse defined on the image of f, typically g: range f → ℂ, and holomorphic there. The code doesn’t model “onto its image”.
  4) Even if IsAnalytic were replaced by the correct Mathlib predicate (e.g., Complex.AnalyticAt/IsHolomorphicOn, etc.), the definition of Conformal would still not match the intended target (since it demands global bijectivity and a globally defined inverse on ℂ).

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The Lean code asserts that an injective analytic f: ℂ → ℂ is a global biholomorphism ℂ ≃ ℂ (with a globally holomorphic inverse). The natural statement asserts only a biholomorphism between ℂ and the image f(ℂ) (i.e., conformal onto its image). Additionally, the analytic predicate is vacuous in the code. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Given the vacuous auxiliary definition and the mismatch between “onto its image” vs “onto ℂ”, the translation fails. Even fixing the analytic predicate, the final theorem/definition remains unfaithful.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code models f as a function on all of ℂ, but restricts analyticity to the closed unit disk; this is a standard and acceptable specialization (the original only required f to be defined and holomorphic on some neighborhood of the closed disk). No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Statement: For an open set U ⊆ ℂ (hU : IsOpen U), there exists a sequence K : ℕ → Set ℂ such that:
  • ∀ n, IsCompact (K n): each K_n is compact.
  • ∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n + 1)): the sequence is strictly increasing in the sense K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}°.
  • ∀ n, ∃ D : Finset (Set ℂ), K n ⊆ ⋃₀ D ∧ ⋃₀ D ⊆ interior (K (n + 1)): for each n, there is a finite collection D of subsets of ℂ whose union covers K_n and is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.
  • U = ⋃ n, interior (K n): U is the union of the interiors of the K_n.

2) Faithfulness assessment to the natural language statement:
- Matches:
  • U is open in ℂ.
  • Existence of a sequence K_n of compact sets.
  • The nesting condition K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}°.
  • U equals the union of the interiors of K_n (index starts at 0 in Lean but that’s a harmless reindexing).
  • For each n, there is a finite collection of sets whose union lies between K_n and K_{n+1}°.
- Discrepancies:
  • The natural statement requires the K_n to be compact subsets of U (i.e., K_n ⊆ U). The Lean statement does not include K n ⊆ U. From U = ⋃ interior(K n), one can deduce interior(K n) ⊆ U for each n, but not K n ⊆ U. This is a genuine weakening; for example, with U the open unit disk and K_1 the closed unit disk, we would still have interior(K_1) = U, but K_1 ⊄ U.
  • The natural statement requires the covering sets D_{kn} to be closed disks. In Mathlib terms, these would be closed balls closedBall c r. The Lean code only quantifies over a Finset (Set ℂ) with no structure, so the sets need not be disks, nor even closed. This is a substantial weakening.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is strictly weaker than the natural language statement in two key ways: it omits K_n ⊆ U and it does not enforce that the covering sets are closed disks. The indexing change (ℕ vs starting at 1) is acceptable, but the two substantive omissions mean the formal statement does not faithfully capture the original theorem.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines: just importing and opening namespaces; no mathematical content change.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X]`: X is a type equipped with a metric space structure and is complete; this matches “(X,d) be a complete metric space”.
  - `(U : ℕ → Set X)`: a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) of subsets of X; this matches the sequence {U_n}.
  - `(hU : ∀ n, IsOpen (U n))`: each U n is open; matches “open sets”.
  - `(hU' : ∀ n, Dense (U n))`: each U n is dense; matches “dense sets”.
  - `: Dense (⋂ n, U n)`: the conclusion is that the intersection over all n of U n is dense; matches the goal that the intersection is dense.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language uses the index n = 1,2,3,..., while the Lean code uses ℕ (typically starting at 0). This is a harmless reindexing: defining V n = U_{n+1} reconciles the two. The theorem’s content is the same: a countable intersection of open dense sets in a complete metric space is dense (a Baire category theorem corollary).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts (MetricSpace, CompleteSpace, IsOpen, Dense) are standard Mathlib notions.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions since we are checking the statement/translation, not the proof.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- They are the same in mathematical meaning. The only notational difference is the starting index (1 vs 0), which is immaterial and standard in formalizations. The Lean statement even slightly generalizes by allowing any ℕ index, but this does not change the content of the theorem.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem taylor_approx_two_on_convex_of_continuous_on {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] {U : Set E} (hU : Convex ℝ U) {f : E → ℝ} (hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U) : ... := by sorry`
  This introduces a general real normed vector space E, a subset U ⊆ E, assumes U is convex, f : E → ℝ, and f is C^2 on U (in the Fréchet sense: `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U`).
- The statement to prove:
  For every compact set K ⊆ E, if K is compact and K ⊆ U, then for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x, y ∈ K with ‖y − x‖ < δ, we have the estimate
  | f(y) − f(x) − (fderiv ℝ f x)(y−x) − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun z => fderiv ℝ f z) x)(y−x))(y−x) | ≤ ε * ‖y − x‖^2.
  Here `(fderiv ℝ f x)` is the Fréchet derivative at x (a continuous linear map E → ℝ), and `fderiv ℝ (fun z => fderiv ℝ f z) x` is the derivative of the derivative at x, a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] (E →L[ℝ] ℝ). Applying it to (y−x) gives a linear functional on E, and then applying to (y−x) again yields the bilinear second differential evaluated on (y−x, y−x). The factor 1/2 is present as in the standard second-order Taylor formula.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 with Hessian H_f continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- Lean assumptions: `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` implies that f is twice continuously differentiable on U, hence the Hessian (second differential) is continuous on U. Convexity of U is assumed.`
- Uniformity on compact subsets is expressed as: for any compact K ⊆ U and any ε>0, there exists a single δ>0 working for all x,y ∈ K with ‖y−x‖<δ, bounding the remainder by ε‖y−x‖^2. This matches the intended “uniform on compact subsets” formulation.
- The target formula uses the first derivative and the second derivative term with factor 1/2, evaluated bilinearly on (y−x,y−x), exactly the classical second-order Taylor polynomial remainder estimate.
- The code works in a slightly more general setting (arbitrary real normed vector space E, not just ℝ^n). This is an acceptable and standard generalization.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The code faithfully states that for a C^2 function on a convex set U, the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U, with the correct estimate form and quantifiers. The generalization from ℝ^n to any real normed space is slight and appropriate. No vacuous placeholders are used; all notions are standard Mathlib definitions. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful (slightly more general) formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem cauchy_product_abs_summable (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : Summable fun n => |a n|) (hb : Summable b) : Summable fun n => |(Finset.range (n+1)).sum fun k => a k * b (n - k)| := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let a and b be real sequences indexed by natural numbers. Assume that the series of absolute values of a is summable (i.e., ∑ |a_n| converges) and that the series of b is summable (i.e., ∑ b_n converges, possibly conditionally). Define the Cauchy product coefficients c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}. Then the series ∑ |c_n| converges (i.e., the Cauchy product converges absolutely). The expression `(Finset.range (n+1)).sum ...` is precisely the finite sum from k=0 to n; since k ≤ n in that range, `n - k` is the usual difference (no truncation issue). The absolute value is the standard absolute value on ℝ.
  The comment in the docstring notes that the statement is false in general, but this is just a remark and not part of the formal content.

2) Comparing to the original natural language statement:
- Original: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show the Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely.”
- Lean: Assumes ∑ |a_n| converges (absolute convergence), assumes ∑ b_n converges (any convergent series), and concludes that the Cauchy product coefficients form an absolutely summable series. This matches the claim exactly. Indexing starts at n=0 rather than n=1, which is a benign shift. The field is ℝ (a slight specialization from potentially ℝ or ℂ), which is acceptable per the guidelines.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- No auxiliary definitions; no vacuous placeholders. The theorem statement is exactly the mathematical claim in formal terms. The indexing shift and specialization to ℝ are minor and acceptable. Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement, despite the correctness remark in the comment.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement: Let (X, d) be a metric space, S ⊆ X totally bounded, and f : S → ℝ continuous. Prove that f is Riemann integrable.
- Domain and setting: The original statement is about a function defined on a totally bounded subset S of an arbitrary metric space X. The Lean code restricts to f : ℝ → ℝ and s = Icc a b ⊆ ℝ. This is a different setting.
- Hypotheses: The original requires S to be totally bounded; the Lean code uses the specific case of a closed interval in ℝ and continuity on it, with no mention of total boundedness or general metric spaces.
- Conclusion: The original claims Riemann integrability of f on S. The Lean code asserts a placeholder predicate RiemannIntegrableOn that is always True, so it does not capture actual integrability.
- Proof status: The code uses sorry, and more crucially, the predicate is vacuous, so even if the proof were filled in, it would not express the intended property.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code targets a special case (continuous on a closed interval in ℝ) and replaces “Riemann integrable” with a vacuous True predicate. It ignores the general metric space and totally bounded subset context. Because of the vacuous definition, even the special case is not faithfully represented. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Issues found:
- Vacuous auxiliary definition RiemannIntegrableOn := True (violates guideline against placeholders).
- The theorem statement does not match the original problem (wrong domain, wrong hypothesis: closed interval vs. totally bounded subset in a general metric space).
- Uses sorry for the proof (allowed per instructions), but the central problem is the vacuous predicate and mismatch in statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation
- Imports and opens: Using Mathlib, Complex, and Set. Variables a, b : ℝ; γ : ℝ → ℂ; θ : ℝ → ℝ. The curve is defined on ℝ but all hypotheses/conclusions are restricted to the interval Icc a b.

- Theorem exists_lift_argument: Hypotheses: γ is continuous on [a,b]; γ(t) ≠ 0 for t ∈ [a,b]; θ is continuous on [a,b]; and for t ∈ [a,b], exp(i θ(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)|. Conclusion: There exists θ' : ℝ → ℝ such that θ' is continuous on [a,b], exp(i θ'(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)| on [a,b], and θ'(a) = θ(a).
  Natural language: This matches the existence of a continuous argument lifting of γ/|γ| on [a,b] that agrees with θ at a. The assumptions are slightly more general (only continuity of γ instead of piecewise smooth), but that is acceptable.

- Theorem lift_endpoints_eq_iff_origin_inside: Hypotheses: a < b; γ is continuous on [a,b]; γ(t) ≠ 0 on [a,b]; γ a = γ b (closed curve); γ is injective on (a,b) (simplicity); θ' : ℝ → ℝ is continuous on [a,b]; and exp(i θ'(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)| on [a,b]. Conclusion: θ'(b) = θ'(a) + 2π ↔ (0 ∈ interior (range γ)).
  Natural language: It claims for a simple closed curve and any continuous lift θ' of the unit vector γ/|γ|, the endpoint difference equals +2π exactly when the origin lies in interior(range γ).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement
- Existence part: Faithful. The original requires a lift θ~ with exp(i θ~) = γ/|γ| and θ~(a) = θ(a). The theorem exists_lift_argument states exactly that, under slightly weaker regularity (continuity instead of piecewise smooth), which is an acceptable generalization.

- Endpoint/inside equivalence part: Not faithful. The original says: θ~(b) = θ~(a) + 2π iff the origin is inside the region bounded by γ. The code formalizes the right-hand side as 0 ∈ interior (range γ), which is not the same as “the region bounded by γ”. For a simple closed curve in the plane, the image (range γ) is a 1-dimensional Jordan curve with empty interior as a subset of ℝ², so interior (range γ) = ∅; this predicate is wrong and does not capture the bounded component of the complement (the Jordan interior). Moreover, the code uses range γ over all ℝ (not restricted to [a,b]), so even if one tried to use interior(range γ), it would be the interior of the full trajectory, not the closed-loop segment.

- Orientation/sign: The code asserts θ'(b) = θ'(a) + 2π (not ±2π). The user’s statement also uses +2π; so the code matches the user’s statement on this point (even though in general one might expect ±2π depending on orientation). This is fine for matching the user’s text.

- Regularity: The code drops the piecewise smooth hypothesis (uses continuity). That is a benign generalization and acceptable.

3) Final comparison
- The first theorem is a faithful rendering of the existence of a continuous argument lifting matching the given θ at a.
- The second theorem’s formalization of “origin inside the region bounded by γ” is incorrect: it uses 0 ∈ interior (range γ) and also fails to restrict the range to [a,b]. Therefore, the core equivalence is not faithfully translated.

Conclusion: Overall, not faithful due to the wrong formalization of the bounded region (Jordan interior) and the un-restricted range. Hence it fails.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter Metric` bring in Mathlib and open namespaces for filters and metric notions.
- The theorem `tendsto_norm_atTop_iff {z0 : Complex} {f : Complex → Complex}` states an equivalence:
  Left-hand side: `Tendsto (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) (nhdsWithin z0 {z | z ≠ z0}) atTop` means that as z approaches z0 within the punctured neighborhood (i.e., excluding z0), the function |f(z)| tends to infinity (atTop).
  Right-hand side: `∀ M : ℝ, M > 0 → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, z ≠ z0 → Complex.abs (z - z0) < δ → M < Complex.abs (f z)` is the epsilon-delta style statement: for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with z ≠ z0 and |z - z0| < δ, we have |f(z)| > M.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z − z0| < δ.”
- The Lean statement uses the well-known equivalent formulation that lim to infinity on the Riemann sphere is the same as |f(z)| → ∞, and expresses the limit via filters on the punctured neighborhood `nhdsWithin z0 {z | z ≠ z0}`. This matches the intended notion of approaching z0 while possibly excluding z0 itself.
- The right-hand side in Lean explicitly excludes z = z0 and requires `|z − z0| < δ`, which is the standard and correct formulation for limits (equivalently, `0 < |z − z0| < δ`). The natural language version omits the explicit exclusion `z ≠ z0` (i.e., it says just `|z − z0| < δ`), which is a common shorthand but would be too strong if taken literally. The Lean version captures the correct, standard intent.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- The core mathematical content is the equivalence between “f tends to ∞ (Riemann sphere)” and the neighborhood condition “|f(z)| can be made arbitrarily large near z0 (excluding z0)”. The Lean code formalizes this precisely (via |f| → atTop on the punctured nhds) and the epsilon-delta condition with `z ≠ z0`.
- Minor discrepancy: the natural statement does not explicitly say `z ≠ z0` (or `0 < |z − z0|`), while the Lean statement does. This is a standard and necessary technical clarification rather than a change of meaning, especially since the natural language also references the Riemann sphere limit, which by convention uses punctured neighborhoods.
- Another minor point: the Lean statement uses the equivalent condition “|f| → ∞” instead of explicitly mentioning the Riemann sphere, which is mathematically equivalent and acceptable.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the intended statement, with only the standard technical clarification of excluding z0 in the neighborhood condition.

- `TendstoUniformlyOn (fun (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => x ^ k)) (fun x => 1 / (1 - x)) atTop (Set.Icc (-c) c)` means: the sequence of functions f_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k converges uniformly on the set [-c, c] to the function x ↦ 1/(1 - x), as n → ∞ (atTop on ℕ).
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it’s a direct theorem statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on [-c, c] for 0 ≤ c < 1. The Lean statement asserts uniform convergence of the partial sums on [-c, c], and even specifies the limit as 1/(1 - x). This is a standard strengthening but entirely consistent with the intended claim.
- The interval `Set.Icc (-c) c` matches [-c, c]. The hypotheses `0 ≤ c` and `c < 1` match 0 ≤ c < 1.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content is the same: uniform convergence of the geometric series on [-c, c] for 0 ≤ c < 1. The Lean code is precise and slightly stronger by identifying the limit. No discrepancies that change the meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation (indeed, a standard formalization) of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] {s : Set E} {f : E → ℝ}` sets up a general real normed vector space E, a subset s ⊆ E, and a function f: E → ℝ.
- The theorem `fderiv_bounded_on.lipschitz_on_with (K : NNReal) (h_bound : ∀ x ∈ s, ‖(fderiv ℝ f x : E →L[ℝ] ℝ)‖ ≤ (K : ℝ)) : LipschitzOnWith K f s` states: If the (Fréchet) derivative of f at every point x in s has operator norm bounded by K, then f is K-Lipschitz on the set s. Here `fderiv ℝ f x` is the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ), `‖·‖` is its operator norm, and `LipschitzOnWith K f s` means for all x,y ∈ s, ‖f x - f y‖ ≤ K‖x - y‖.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For f: ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable with continuous gradient, show that on any compact subset, if the gradient is bounded on that subset, then f is Lipschitz there. The key mathematical implication is: bounded derivative on a set ⇒ f is Lipschitz on that set. The compactness and continuity of ∇f are used to guarantee boundedness on compact sets; once boundedness is known, the Lipschitz conclusion follows.
- The Lean theorem precisely formalizes this key implication (bounded derivative ⇒ Lipschitz) in a slightly more general setting: E is any real normed space, not just ℝ^n, and the derivative is the Fréchet derivative. It does not mention compactness or continuity because those are only needed to deduce boundedness; the lemma isolates the core conditional statement “if bounded then Lipschitz,” which is exactly what the problem asks to use on compact subsets.

3) Final check for differences:
- Generalization: E is any real normed space (generalization of ℝ^n). Acceptable and faithful.
- Uses the Fréchet derivative `fderiv` rather than the gradient; for ℝ^n these correspond, so this is faithful.
- The Lean statement does not explicitly assume differentiability or continuity of the derivative; it directly assumes a bound on the norm of `fderiv`. This matches the conditional part of the natural statement (“if ∇f is bounded on those subsets”) and is the standard way to state the key lemma used to conclude Lipschitzness. The compactness/continuity aspects are auxiliary to obtain the bound and are not required in this lemma.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is meaningful and standard in Mathlib’s vocabulary. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed for this audit; we only assess the statement’s fidelity.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and slightly more general formalization of the core claim needed: bounded derivative on a set implies Lipschitz on that set, hence in particular on compact sets where the derivative is bounded by continuity.

  Natural language: For any metric space X that is compact (in the open-cover sense, encoded by `[CompactSpace X]`), and any sequence `u : ℕ → X`, there exists a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` (i.e., a subsequence selector) and a point `x : X` such that the subsequence `u ∘ φ` converges to `x` (expressed via filter convergence `Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)`).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Hypotheses: The natural language assumes X is a metric space where every open cover has a finite subcover; in Mathlib this is precisely `[CompactSpace X]` for the whole space, together with `[MetricSpace X]`. So the assumptions match exactly.
- Conclusion: The natural language asserts every sequence has a convergent subsequence. The Lean statement asserts existence of a strictly increasing index map φ such that the subsequence converges to some x in X, expressed via filters. This is the standard formalization of “convergent subsequence.”
- No auxiliary, vacuous placeholders are introduced; there are no fake definitions. The use of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing, as only the statement matters.

3) Final check:
- The math problems are the same: compact metric space implies sequential compactness. No change in generality or strength. The use of StrictMono to define a subsequence and Filter.Tendsto to state convergence is standard and equivalent to the natural language claim.

- open Equiv: Open the namespace for permutations (Equiv.Perm).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For any permutation matrix P, det(P) ∈ {−1, 1}.
- The Lean code defines a permutation matrix from a permutation σ explicitly and asserts its determinant is in {−1, 1}.
- This is exactly the same content: every permutation matrix is of the form defined, and the conclusion matches.
- The code specializes the base ring to Int, whereas the natural-language statement is ring-agnostic. This is a mild specialization that still captures the intended result (and is a standard setting). It fits the guideline that slight specialization is acceptable.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: perm_matrix is a genuine, standard definition. The only 'sorry' is in the proof of the theorem, which is allowed under the auditing instructions since we only check the statement.
- No extraneous auxiliary definitions.
- The only difference is the choice of scalars (Int). This is a benign specialization.
- Therefore, the formal statement faithfully represents the given mathematical statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable {α : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace α]`: We are working in an arbitrary pseudometric space α.
- `theorem tendsto_of_bdd_subseq_unique_limit {x : ℕ → α} {ℓ : α}`: Consider a sequence x : ℕ → α and a point ℓ in α.
- Hypothesis `h_bdd : ∃ c : α, ∃ R : ℝ, ∀ n, dist (x n) c ≤ R`: The sequence (x_n) is bounded, i.e., there exists a center c and radius R such that every term x_n lies within distance R of c.
- Hypothesis `h_subseq : ∀ (s : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono s → ∀ (l : α), Filter.Tendsto (x ∘ s) Filter.atTop (𝓝 l) → l = ℓ`: For every subsequence indexed by a strictly increasing function s, if that subsequence converges to some limit l, then l must equal ℓ. In other words, every convergent subsequence has the same limit ℓ.
- Conclusion `Filter.Tendsto x Filter.atTop (𝓝 ℓ)`: The original sequence x_n converges to ℓ.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: ""Show that if {x_n} is bounded and every convergent subsequence has the same limit ℓ, then x_n → ℓ."" The Lean theorem exactly encodes this:
- Boundedness is expressed via existence of c, R with dist(x_n, c) ≤ R for all n.
- The uniqueness of limits of convergent subsequences is encoded by the `h_subseq` quantification over strictly increasing s and the implication that any limit l must equal ℓ.
- The conclusion is that x_n tends to ℓ.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Space: The Lean code uses a pseudometric space, which is a slight generalization of a metric space; this does not change the essence of the statement and is acceptable as a faithful (even slightly more general) translation.
- Subsequence definition uses `StrictMono s`, which is the standard formalization of subsequences.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary fake definitions.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful (slightly generalized) translation of the natural language theorem.

  Natural language: It is not true that for every ε>0 there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x in the open interval (−1,1), the absolute value of the difference between the nth partial sum of the geometric series ∑_{k=0}^n x^k and 1/(1−x) is ≤ ε. Equivalently, the sequence of partial sums does not converge uniformly on (−1,1) to the function 1/(1−x).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: “Show that the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k does not converge uniformly on (−1,1).” Uniform convergence of a series means the sequence of partial sums converges uniformly to its sum. On (−1,1), the pointwise sum is 1/(1−x), so stating the negation of the uniform convergence inequality to 1/(1−x) exactly captures “does not converge uniformly.”
- The code uses `Ioo (-1) 1` (the open interval (−1,1)), the partial sums `Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) (fun k => x^k)`, and the target function `1/(1−x)`, with the standard ε–N uniform convergence formulation. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The Lean statement is precisely the negation of uniform convergence of the geometric series partial sums to 1/(1−x) on (−1,1), which is exactly what the natural language requests.

The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Every bounded convex set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable."" A standard equivalent criterion for Jordan measurability (for bounded sets in ℝ^n) is that the boundary has Lebesgue measure zero. The Lean statement asserts exactly that the boundary (frontier) of any bounded convex set in ℝ^n has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, the Lean theorem states a condition that is equivalent to (indeed, commonly used as the definition of) Jordan measurability for bounded sets. Therefore, it is a faithful formalization.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- Space: ℝ^n is represented as Fin n → ℝ, which is the standard mathlib encoding; correct.
- Boundedness: Uses Bornology.IsBounded s, which is the usual notion of boundedness in this setting; correct.
- Measure: Uses MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume for Lebesgue measure on ℝ^n; correct.
- Content: The code states ""boundary has Lebesgue measure zero,"" which is exactly the Jordan measurability criterion for bounded sets in ℝ^n. No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted but not relevant to the translation audit.

Conclusion: The formal statement is a faithful translation (indeed an equivalent restatement) of the natural language statement.

The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for this translation task.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: if ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent. The code exactly encodes this: hypotheses are `Summable a` and `¬ Summable |a|`, and the conclusion is the definition of conditional convergence `Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable |a|`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: The natural language uses sums from n=1 to ∞, while Lean’s `Summable` sums from n ∈ ℕ (typically starting at 0). This is a standard harmless discrepancy; adding/removing finitely many terms does not affect (absolute or conditional) convergence.
- Terminology: ""diverges"" is represented as `¬ Summable`, which is appropriate for the nonnegative series `∑ |a_n|`.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the definition uses genuine Mathlib notions. The theorem statement precisely captures the intended meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem compactSpace_of_seq_tendsto_imp_tendsto {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] ... : CompactSpace X := ...`
  This declares: For a type X with a metric space structure, if a certain sequential compactness-like condition holds, then X is compact (i.e., `CompactSpace X`).
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ (u : ℕ → X), ∃ x, ∃ b : ℕ → ℕ, Tendsto (u ∘ b) atTop (𝓝 x)`
  In words: For every sequence u: ℕ → X, there exist a point x in X and a function b: ℕ → ℕ such that the reindexed sequence u ∘ b converges to x (with respect to the neighborhood filter 𝓝 x).

No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced; it relies on Mathlib concepts: MetricSpace, Tendsto, atTop, and CompactSpace.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence.” In the standard formalization, a subsequence is represented by a strictly increasing reindexing b: ℕ → ℕ (i.e., `StrictMono b`).
- Lean hypothesis: It requires only the existence of b: ℕ → ℕ with no monotonicity/strictly increasing condition. This is a crucial difference. Without `StrictMono b`, b could be constant (e.g., b(n) = 0), making u ∘ b a constant sequence which trivially converges to u 0. Hence the Lean hypothesis is satisfied in any space for any sequence, rendering the assumption effectively trivial and far weaker than the intended “convergent subsequence” condition.
- Conclusion: `CompactSpace X` is an appropriate formalization of “every open cover of X has a finite subcover.” So the conclusion matches the natural statement’s target.

Thus, the main mismatch is the absence of the strictly increasing condition on b. The docstring comment mentions “strictly increasing b,” but the actual hypothesis does not include it. This materially changes the meaning and makes the implication vastly stronger (indeed false in general), so the formal statement is not a faithful rendering of the natural language claim.

3) Final check:
- Same or different? Different. The hypothesis in Lean is missing the essential `StrictMono b` (or equivalent subsequence constraint), which is the core of what a subsequence is. Everything else (metric space assumption and compactness as `CompactSpace X`) aligns, but this omission breaks faithfulness.
- Suggested fix: Require `∃ x b, StrictMono b ∧ Tendsto (u ∘ b) atTop (𝓝 x)` in the hypothesis.

Given there are no vacuous or placeholder definitions and the overall structure and conclusion match, but with a crucial missing condition, the translation is not faithful.

This is exactly the desired conclusion by definition.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, show the series is conditionally convergent. The Lean definition of conditionally_convergent exactly formalizes “convergent but not absolutely convergent” as Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|. The theorem then proves this directly from the assumptions.
- Using ¬ Summable for ∑ |a_n| matches “diverges” in the standard sense. Since |a_n| ≥ 0, non-summability is equivalent to divergence (indeed divergence to +∞ for partial sums), so there is no mismatch.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions or placeholders. The definition is legitimate and standard. The theorem matches the statement precisely and proves it by unfolding the definition.
- No technical discrepancies (e.g., norm vs absolute value) since the sequence is ℝ-valued and |x| = ‖x‖ in Mathlib.

Conclusion: The translation is exact and faithful.

- The conclusion asserts the existence of open sets U, V in ℂ and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that: U and V are open; z0 ∈ U and f z0 ∈ V; image f U = V; g ∘ f = id on U; f ∘ g = id on V; and g is complex-differentiable on V (DifferentiableOn ℂ g V). This expresses that f restricts to a bijection U → V with inverse g, and the inverse is holomorphic on V.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language hypothesis: f is analytic on ℂ and f'(z0) ≠ 0. The code’s hypothesis only assumes HasDerivAt f f' z0 (derivative exists at z0) and f' ≠ 0. It does not assume that f is analytic (holomorphic) in any neighborhood of z0, let alone globally on ℂ. This is a significant omission: complex differentiability at a single point is much weaker than being analytic in a neighborhood, which is the standard hypothesis for the complex inverse function theorem.
- The conclusion in natural language: f is a local diffeomorphism at z0 (locally invertible with analytic inverse). The code’s conclusion matches this structure: it produces open neighborhoods U of z0 and V of f z0, gives a two-sided inverse between U and V, and asserts g is holomorphic on V. However, the code does not assert that f is holomorphic on U, though in the original problem f was assumed analytic globally, making that redundant. The main issue remains the missing analyticity assumption on f.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are different. The code weakens the hypothesis from “f is analytic” to “f has a derivative at z0,” which is not equivalent and is insufficient for the stated conclusion. Everything else in the conclusion is in line with the intended notion of local biholomorphism, but the missing analyticity assumption means the translation is not faithful to the original problem.
- Suggested fix: Replace HasDerivAt f f' z0 with something expressing holomorphicity near z0, e.g., AnalyticAt ℂ f z0 (or a stronger global AnalyticOn ℂ univ f), and possibly include DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (or AnalyticOn ℂ U f) in the conclusion if desired.

Given the substantial mismatch in assumptions, this is not a faithful translation.

2) Whole translation faithfulness: Since no code is supplied, there is no formal statement to compare against the natural language statement. Therefore, the translation cannot be faithful.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural statement: If A is linear and bounded between normed vector spaces, then A is continuous.
- The Lean theorem: In the setting of normed vector spaces over any normed field 𝕜, a linear map A that satisfies a linear growth bound with some M is continuous. This is the same mathematical content; it is even a standard formalization. The explicit M parameter is equivalent to the existential boundedness assumption.

3) Final check and differences:
- Slight difference: The Lean theorem assumes a specific constant M is given rather than merely asserting existence. This is a harmless strengthening and standard in formalization; from ∃ M one can choose such an M and apply the theorem.
- Generality: The Lean statement allows any normed field 𝕜, while the natural language did not specify the base field. This is a benign generalization consistent with the theorem.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions, nothing placeholder; all structures (NormedAddCommGroup, NormedSpace, NormedField) are standard Mathlib.

Despite the docstring saying it is the radius of convergence statement, the lemma itself makes no reference to the series, its coefficients, or any radius. It is completely vacuous regarding the intended content.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The function f is correctly defined.
- The power series at 0 is correctly specified via coeff, and the convergence/equality for |x|<1 is stated in series_expansion.
- Analyticity at 0 is captured in analytic_at_zero by existence of a neighborhood on which the series equals f.
- However, the original statement also asks to “find … its radius of convergence.” The code’s radius_of_convergence lemma does not state this at all; it is merely 1 = 1, unrelated to the series. Thus the crucial part “its radius of convergence is 1” is not formalized.

3) Final check and differences:
- Same: definition of f; power series coefficients at 0; equality on |x|<1; analyticity at 0.
- Different: The requested explicit statement that the radius of convergence is 1 is missing and replaced by a vacuous lemma 1 = 1. Therefore, the code does not faithfully translate the full natural language statement.

Given this nontrivial mismatch on a key requested part, the translation is not faithful overall, though much of it is correct.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem is named ""inverse_function_theorem_Rn"" and concerns maps from R^n to R^n, formalized as (Fin n → ℝ).
- Hypotheses:
  - IsOpen U: U ⊆ ℝ^n is open.
  - ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U: f is C^1 on U (continuously differentiable of order 1).
  - p ∈ U: the point p lies in U.
  - IsUnit (LinearMap.det ((fderivWithin ℝ f U p).toLinearMap)): the determinant of the derivative of f at p is a unit in ℝ, i.e., nonzero. Since U is open, fderivWithin at p coincides with the usual derivative.
- Conclusion: There exist open sets V, W with
  - IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W,
  - p ∈ V and V ⊆ U,
  - f '' V = W (so f maps V onto W),
  - Set.InjOn f V (f is injective on V),
  - and there exists g : ℝ^n → ℝ^n such that
    - ∀ y ∈ W, g y ∈ V (so g maps W into V),
    - ∀ y ∈ W, f (g y) = y (g is a right inverse on W for f|_V),
    - ContDiffOn ℝ 1 g W (g is C^1 on W),
    - ∀ x ∈ V, fderivWithin ℝ g W (f x) = ContinuousLinearMap.inverse (fderivWithin ℝ f U x), i.e., the derivative of g at y = f(x) equals the inverse of the derivative of f at x. Since U, W are open, these within-derivatives coincide with the usual derivatives.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- NL: U open, f : U → ℝ^n C^1, p ∈ U, det Df|_p ≠ 0. Then ∃ open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, f|_V injective, hence an inverse g : W → V exists with g(y) = (f|_V)^{-1}(y). Furthermore g is C^1 and Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1} for all x ∈ V, y = f(x).
- Lean matches each part:
  - Uses (Fin n → ℝ) as ℝ^n.
  - U open, f C^1 on U, p ∈ U.
  - det nonzero via IsUnit of det of the derivative at p.
  - Open sets V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U and f '' V = W.
  - f injective on V.
  - Existence of g mapping W → V with f ∘ g = id on W; this plus injectivity and f '' V = W implies g = (f|_V)^{-1}.
  - g is C^1 on W.
  - Derivative identity Dg at f(x) equals inverse of Df at x. The code uses within-derivatives, but U and W are asserted open, so this coincides with the usual derivative, matching the statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code’s use of fderivWithin and ContinuousLinearMap.inverse is a standard formalization detail; since U and W are open, this is equivalent to the classical derivatives and inverse in the statement.
- The code doesn’t explicitly state g ∘ f = id on V, but it follows from injectivity on V and f(g y) = y for y ∈ W together with surjectivity f '' V = W. This matches the intended inverse relationship.
- Domain/codomain representation (Fin n → ℝ) is a standard formal model of ℝ^n.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions come from Mathlib. No auxiliary fake definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language inverse function theorem (local version) in ℝ^n.

  - `E` is a type equipped with a normed additive commutative group structure and a real normed space structure, i.e., a real normed vector space. This matches the natural language ""X is a normed vector space.""
  - `f : E → ℝ`, `x₀ : E`: a real-valued function on the space and a point in the space.
  - `h_diff : DifferentiableAt ℝ f x₀`: f is Fréchet differentiable at x₀ over ℝ. This matches ""f is differentiable at x₀.""
  - `h_min : IsLocalMin f x₀`: f attains a local minimum at x₀ (Mathlib's `IsLocalMin` means f(x₀) ≤ f(y) for y in a neighborhood of x₀). This matches the statement.
  - Conclusion: `fderiv ℝ f x₀ = (0 : E →L[ℝ] ℝ)`: the Fréchet derivative at x₀ is the zero continuous linear map from E to ℝ. This is exactly ""Df(x₀) = 0 as an element of L(X, ℝ).""

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The code precisely formalizes the natural language theorem in standard Mathlib terms: a real normed vector space, real-valued function, differentiable at a point, local minimum, and the Fréchet derivative viewed as a continuous linear map equals zero.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing purposes.
- No change of meaning, generalization, or specialization beyond the intended setting. The codomain is ℝ and the scalar field is ℝ, as in the natural statement.

  This claims: for an arbitrary function mstar from sets in ℝ^n to nonnegative extended reals, and for a ≤ b coordinatewise, the value of mstar on the closed box equals the (real) volume of the box coerced to ENNReal. There is no assumption that mstar is an outer measure, nor that it is the specific outer measure defined via coverings by open rectangles.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is about a specific outer measure m* on ℝ^n (defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles), and asserts that for a closed rectangle R, m*(R) equals its usual volume V(R). The Lean code does not encode that mstar is an outer measure at all, let alone the particular outer measure defined via coverings by open rectangles. It quantifies over an arbitrary function mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal and asserts the equality for that arbitrary function, which is far stronger (and generally false) and thus not faithful to the intended statement. While the definitions of closed_box and box_volume are reasonable and faithful, the core measure-theoretic content is missing.

3) Final comparison:
- Missing structure/assumptions: The code does not assume mstar is an OuterMeasure, nor that it is the outer measure constructed via open rectangles. This is a crucial omission.
- Overgeneralized theorem: The code asserts the equality for any function mstar, not the specific m*.
- Domain/codomain modeling (Fin n → ℝ for ℝ^n, ENNReal.ofReal for volume) is fine and faithful.
- The rectangle hypothesis h : ∀ i, a i ≤ b i is reasonable and aligns with a closed rectangle.
Given these discrepancies, the translation is not faithful.

  Statement context:
  • E is a normed additive commutative group.
  • a : ℕ → E is a sequence.
  • m : ℕ → ℕ is a strictly increasing, unbounded map with m 0 = 0, which defines grouping boundaries.
  Hypotheses:
  • ha : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖) means the series ∑ ‖a n‖ converges (absolute convergence of ∑ a n).
  • h0 : m 0 = 0 ensures the first block starts at index 0.
  • hm : StrictMono m means m(k+1) > m k, so each block is nonempty and blocks are disjoint and ordered.
  • h_unbounded : ∀ N, ∃ k, m k ≥ N ensures the blocks cover all indices (m → ∞), i.e., a genuine grouping of the entire series into consecutive finite chunks.
  Conclusion:
  • Summable (fun k => ‖Finset.sum (Finset.range (m (k + 1) - m k)) (fun i => a (m k + i))‖)
    The series of norms of grouped sums is summable; equivalently, the regrouped series converges absolutely.
  • (tsum fun k => Finset.sum (Finset.range (m (k + 1) - m k)) (fun i => a (m k + i))) = tsum fun n => a n
    The sum of the regrouped series equals the sum of the original series.
  The body ends with sorry, but we are only assessing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then any series obtained by grouping terms also converges and has the same sum.
- Lean code hypothesis ha captures absolute convergence. The conditions on m (strictly increasing, unbounded, starting at 0) formalize “grouping terms” into consecutive finite blocks that cover all terms exactly once and preserve order.
- Conclusion asserts:
  • The regrouped series is absolutely summable (stronger than mere convergence), so it certainly converges.
  • The total sum equals the original sum.
- Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful (indeed slightly stronger) formalization of the natural statement.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Indexing: Lean uses ℕ starting at 0; the natural language uses n starting at 1. This is a harmless shift.
- The notion of “grouping” is represented by contiguous blocks via m; this matches the standard meaning of grouping without reordering.
- The Lean theorem even proves absolute summability of the grouped series, which implies convergence. This is a permissible strengthening and does not weaken faithfulness.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. All components are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The code is a legitimate and faithful translation (indeed slightly stronger) of the natural statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: bring in the math library and set-theoretic notation. No mathematical content change.
- The theorem `fderiv_eq_zero_of_is_max_on` is stated for a general real normed vector space `E` (with `[NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]`), a function `f : E → ℝ`, a set `K : Set E`, and a point `x₀ : E`.
- Hypotheses:
  • `IsCompact K`: K is compact.
  • `ContinuousOn f K`: f is continuous on K.
  • `DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K)`: f is (Fréchet) differentiable on the interior of K.
  • `x₀ ∈ interior K`: the point x₀ is in the interior of K.
  • `(∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x₀)`: f attains a maximum on K at x₀ (i.e., for all x in K, f(x) ≤ f(x₀)).
- Conclusion: `fderiv ℝ f x₀ = 0`: the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map from E to ℝ) at x₀ is the zero map.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is for f: ℝ^n → ℝ, continuous on a compact K ⊂ ℝ^n, differentiable on int(K), and attaining a maximum at x₀ ∈ int(K), then Df(x₀) = 0.
- The Lean statement matches all structural hypotheses: compact K, continuity on K, differentiability on interior K, x₀ ∈ interior K, and attainment of the maximum at x₀. The conclusion matches: the derivative at x₀ is zero (in Lean, as the zero continuous linear map, which corresponds to Df(x₀)=0).
- The Lean version generalizes the domain from ℝ^n to an arbitrary real normed vector space E. This is a benign generalization and still faithful to the original statement under the provided guidelines.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Lean uses a general real normed vector space E instead of ℝ^n. This is a slight generalization and acceptable.
- All other conditions (compactness, continuity on K, differentiability on interior K, interior point x₀, maximum at x₀) and the conclusion (derivative zero) align precisely.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a slight generalization) of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem exists_holomorphic_log (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf : Differentiable ℂ f) (hf_ne : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0) : ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ g ∧ ∀ z, f z = Complex.exp (g z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let f: ℂ → ℂ be a function that is complex-differentiable everywhere (i.e., entire/holomorphic on ℂ), and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ ℂ. Then there exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ that is complex-differentiable everywhere (holomorphic/entire) such that for all z ∈ ℂ, f(z) = exp(g(z)).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: “Let f : ℂ → ℂ be analytic and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show that there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.”
- In Mathlib, `Differentiable ℂ f` on the whole domain ℂ expresses that f is holomorphic (entire). The nonvanishing condition `∀ z, f z ≠ 0` matches exactly. The conclusion `∃ g, Differentiable ℂ g ∧ ∀ z, f z = Complex.exp (g z)` states the existence of a holomorphic g with f = exp ∘ g pointwise, which is precisely “there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib notions directly. The use of `by sorry` affects the proof, not the statement; the task is about translation fidelity, not proving it.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Domain and codomain match (ℂ → ℂ).
- “Analytic”/“holomorphic” is rendered as `Differentiable ℂ` on all of ℂ, which is standard in Mathlib.
- Nonvanishing condition is identical.
- Conclusion f = e^g is expressed pointwise and matches function equality.
- No extra hypotheses or missing constraints.
Therefore the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's standard definitions of summability and infinite sums.
- `theorem cauchy_product_summable (a b : ℕ → ℝ) ...`: Let a and b be real sequences indexed by ℕ.
- `(ha : Summable fun n => |a n|)`: Assume the series ∑ |a n| converges (absolute convergence of a).
- `(hb : Summable b)`: Assume ∑ b n converges.
- Conclusion:
  - `Summable (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k))`: The sequence c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} is summable (the Cauchy product series converges).
  - `tsum (fun n => ... ) = tsum a * tsum b`: The sum of the Cauchy product equals the product of the sums of a and b.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; acceptable for auditing translation fidelity, since no auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges, then the Cauchy product c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} defines a convergent series and its sum equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- The Lean statement precisely matches this: absolute summability of a (via `Summable fun n => |a n|`), summability of b, definition of c_n via `Finset.range (n + 1)` summing k = 0..n with `b (n - k)`, summability of the resulting series, and the sum equality using `tsum`.
- The use of ℝ is a standard acceptable specialization (the natural statement did not specify the scalar field explicitly). Indexing via ℕ with truncated subtraction is safe since k ≤ n in the range.
- No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (`Summable`, `tsum`, `Finset.sum`) are genuine Mathlib concepts.

3) Final check for differences:
- Content matches exactly: assumptions, definition of c_n, conclusion of summability, and equality of the sum to the product. The only slight specialization is to real sequences (ℝ), which is acceptable.
- No discrepancies found.

Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The file sets up a general finite-dimensional real normed vector space E (so this generalizes ℝ^n).
- The theorem statement taylor_remainder_uniform_on_compact: Given
  • U : Set E, with hU : Convex ℝ U,
  • f : E → ℝ with hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (i.e., f is C^2 on U in the mathlib sense),
  • K : Set E with hK : IsCompact K and hKsub : K ⊆ U,
  the conclusion is a uniform second-order Taylor estimate on K: For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and y ∈ K with dist x y < δ,
    | f y - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x) - (1/2) * (fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x (y - x)) (y - x) | ≤ ε * dist x y^2.
- Here fderiv ℝ f x is the (Fréchet) derivative of f at x, a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ; fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x is the derivative of the map x ↦ fderiv ℝ f x, i.e., the second derivative at x, viewed as a linear map E →L[ℝ] (E →L[ℝ] ℝ); applying it to (y - x) and again to (y - x) yields the quadratic term representing the Hessian applied twice, matching ½ Hess_f(x)[y − x, y − x].

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ, C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U, the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U. The expected formalization is: for any compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all y sufficiently close to x (typically y ∈ U and ∥y − x∥ < δ), the second-order Taylor remainder is bounded by ε ∥y − x∥^2.
- The Lean statement matches this structure very closely:
  • It works in an arbitrary finite-dimensional real normed vector space E (a standard, benign generalization of ℝ^n).
  • ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U captures “f is C^2 on U”, which in mathlib entails continuity of the second derivative; this covers “H_f continuous”.
  • Convexity of U is included as in the natural statement.
  • Uniformity on compact subsets: it quantifies uniformly over x,y ∈ K with y close to x, giving the standard O(∥y − x∥^2) bound with the explicit quadratic term up to 1/2.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- Generalization from ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional E is acceptable and standard.
- The statement restricts y to lie in K (rather than merely in U). Many formulations of “uniform on compact subsets” are stated on K × K near the diagonal, so this is a mild specialization and acceptable.
- A subtlety: the code uses the ambient derivative fderiv ℝ f x (and the ambient second derivative) rather than the within-derivative on U. If U is not assumed open, ContDiffOn guarantees within differentiability; ambient differentiability at boundary points is not automatic. However, in typical mathematical usage “C^2 on U” is taken for open U (or for an open set containing U), so the intended context likely has U open, in which case this subtlety disappears. Even without explicitly assuming openness, this is a common and acceptable formalization choice in mathlib statements of this kind, and it does not change the intended mathematical meaning under standard interpretations.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (with a standard generalization to finite-dimensional spaces and a mild restriction y ∈ K). The only notable subtlety is the use of ambient derivatives rather than within-derivatives when U might be non-open, but this is a typical formalization choice and aligns with the intended meaning in the usual open-domain setting.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix Equiv Equiv.Perm Finset`: Bring in Mathlib and open relevant namespaces. No mathematical content asserted here.

- First theorem:
  `theorem exists_mulVec_eq_zero_of_det_eq_zero [Field K] [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]
      {A : Matrix n n K} (h : A.det = 0) : ∃ v : n → K, v ≠ 0 ∧ A.mulVec v = 0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let K be a field and n a finite type (so an index set of size n) with decidable equality. For any n×n matrix A over K, if det(A) = 0, then there exists a nonzero vector v (indexed by n) such that A · v = 0. Here `A.mulVec v = 0` expresses that the linear combination of the columns of A with coefficients v is the zero vector. This is exactly that the columns of A are linearly dependent.

- Second theorem:
  `theorem mulVec_eq_zero_imp_eq_zero_of_det_ne_zero [Field K] [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]
      {A : Matrix n n K} (h : A.det ≠ 0) {v : n → K} (hv : A.mulVec v = 0) : v = 0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: Under the same assumptions, if det(A) ≠ 0 and A · v = 0, then v = 0. This states that the only linear combination of the columns of A giving zero is the trivial one, i.e., the columns are linearly independent.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to show for an n×n matrix A: if det(A) = 0 then the columns (or rows) are linearly dependent; if det(A) ≠ 0 then the columns (or rows) are linearly independent. The code states precisely the column versions via the concrete equations `A.mulVec v = 0` (dependence: existence of nonzero v; independence: vanishing implies v=0). This is a standard and faithful formalization of column dependence/independence.
- The code assumes K is a field and n is a finite type with decidable equality, which is the standard context for such linear algebra statements. This is a reasonable and faithful formalization; if anything, it is a slight generalization of “n ∈ ℕ” to an arbitrary finite index type, which is acceptable and common in Mathlib.
- The statement mentions “(or rows)”, and the code chooses the columns formulation. This matches the “either columns or rows” phrasing; proving the columns version suffices.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements. The use of `sorry` is in proofs, not in definitions, and does not affect the faithfulness of the statements.
- The request “without resorting to the Laplace formula” concerns the proof method, which is not encoded in the statements. Since we are judging the translation of statements (not proofs), this is fine.

Final check:
- The Lean statements are mathematically equivalent to the natural language claims about columns, with standard assumptions. No mismatches or hidden weakening/strengthening that would alter the meaning. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem derivative_is_linear : IsLinearMap Real (Polynomial.derivative : Polynomial Real → Polynomial Real) := by sorry`: This asserts that the derivative operator on real-coefficient polynomials is linear over the scalars `Real` (i.e., additive and homogeneous). It uses the standard `IsLinearMap` predicate in mathlib.
- `theorem derivative_add (p q : Polynomial Real) : Polynomial.derivative (p + q) = Polynomial.derivative p + Polynomial.derivative q := by sorry`: States additivity of the derivative.
- `theorem derivative_smul (a : Real) (p : Polynomial Real) : Polynomial.derivative (a • p) = a • Polynomial.derivative p := by sorry`: States compatibility with scalar multiplication by real numbers.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show that the derivative operator D: R[t] → R[t] is linear. The Lean code models R[t] as `Polynomial Real`, D as `Polynomial.derivative`, and states linearity both as a bundled property (`IsLinearMap Real ...`) and via the two defining linearity equations (preservation of addition and scalar multiplication). This matches the mathematical content exactly for polynomials over the reals.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scalars are explicitly `Real`, matching R in the statement. Domain/codomain are `Polynomial Real`, matching R[t].
- No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given (with proofs omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable for the translation audit).
- The three theorems together convey precisely that D is a linear operator. There is no mismatch or unintended generalization/specialization beyond choosing R = ℝ.
Hence the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but the code below defines its own predicates instead of using Mathlib's real ones.

- def rectangle {n : ℕ} (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := fun x => ∀ i, a i ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ b i
  Translation: The set of points x in ℝ^n (as functions Fin n → ℝ) such that for each coordinate i, x_i lies between a_i and b_i. This is the standard closed axis-aligned box [a, b] (potentially empty if some a_i > b_i).

- def has_zero_side {n : ℕ} (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Prop := ∃ i, a i = b i

- def riemann_integral {n : ℕ} (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : ℝ := 0
  Translation: Placeholder: sets the Riemann integral of f over s to always be 0. This is also vacuous and forces the desired conclusion regardless of f or s.

  sorry
  Translation: If the rectangle [a, b] has a zero side, then for any function f: ℝ^n → ℝ and under the assumption hf_bounded : True (a meaningless boundedness condition), f is Riemann integrable on [a, b], and the integral over [a, b] equals 0. The proof is omitted (sorry), but given the placeholders, the statement is trivially true in this fake setting.

Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: For a closed rectangle R ⊆ ℝ^n with one side of length 0, for every bounded function f: R → ℝ, f is Riemann integrable on R and ∫_R f = 0.

Key discrepancies:
- The code uses vacuous placeholders for both ""Riemann integrable on"" (always True) and the integral (always 0). This completely bypasses the substance of the statement and is not a faithful formalization.
- The boundedness condition is represented as hf_bounded : True, which is vacuous and does not enforce boundedness.
- The function type is f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ (defined on all of ℝ^n) rather than f : R → ℝ. While working with functions on the ambient space and integrating over a set is a common formalization, here it is paired with vacuous predicates, so it does not capture the intended meaning.
- The rectangle and zero-side definitions themselves are reasonable and align with the intended geometry (though no condition a_i ≤ b_i is enforced, which can make the rectangle empty if some a_i > b_i, but that is a minor technicality compared to the placeholders).

Final check:
- Due to the placeholder definitions riemann_integrable_on := True and riemann_integral := 0, and the boundedness hypothesis set to True, the code does not faithfully represent the real mathematical statement. It ""proves"" the result for the wrong reasons (by definition), not by properly encoding Riemann integrability and the integral.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by legitimate Mathlib notions (e.g., using actual Riemann or Henstock-Kurzweil integrability on boxes, and a real boundedness predicate), the theorem's shape would be faithful. As written, it fails due to vacuous definitions.

  Natural language: For any continuous linear map A: ℝ^n → ℝ^m (represented as `Fin n → ℝ` to `Fin m → ℝ`) and any point x ∈ ℝ^n, the function y ↦ A y has a Fréchet derivative at x, and the derivative is the linear map A itself.
- `theorem fderiv_linear_map (A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) (x : Fin n → ℝ) : fderiv ℝ (fun y => (A : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin m → ℝ)) y) x = A := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any continuous linear map A: ℝ^n → ℝ^m and any x ∈ ℝ^n, the derivative (as given by `fderiv`) of y ↦ A y at x equals A.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let A: ℝ^n → ℝ^m be a linear operator. Prove that A is differentiable at every x ∈ ℝ^n and DA(x) equals A (as a linear map).
- The Lean theorems assert that for all x, HasFDerivAt holds with derivative A, and consequently that fderiv equals A. This directly encodes differentiability everywhere with derivative A.
- Representation of ℝ^n and ℝ^m as `Fin n → ℝ` and `Fin m → ℝ` is standard and faithful.
- The use of `(→L[ℝ])` (continuous linear map) is a slight specialization compared to “linear operator”, but in finite-dimensional real vector spaces every linear map is continuous, so this specialization is equivalent in this context.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements with `sorry` proofs, which is acceptable under the instructions.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Difference: Lean assumes A is a continuous linear map. In finite dimensions this is equivalent to being linear, so there is no substantive change in meaning.
- Otherwise, the statements match exactly: differentiable at every x with derivative A.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- The ambient space E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space (so, essentially ℝ^n). U and K are subsets of E, and f : E → ℝ.
- Hypotheses: U is convex; f is C^2 on U in the sense of ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (i.e., f has continuous derivatives up to order 2 on the set U); K is compact and contained in U.
- Conclusion (uniform second-order Taylor estimate on K): For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h ∈ E with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ, we have
  | f(x + h) − f(x) − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) · ((fderiv ℝ (λ y, fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε · ‖h‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the Fréchet derivative (the gradient as a continuous linear form), and fderiv ℝ (λ y, fderiv ℝ f y) x applied twice to h denotes the bilinear second derivative (the Hessian applied to (h,h)).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The mathematical content matches the classical statement: in finite dimensions, with f C^2 on a convex set U and Hessian continuous (implied by ContDiffOn ℝ 2), the quadratic Taylor expansion has a remainder that is uniformly o(‖h‖^2) on compact subsets K ⊆ U. The Lean statement encodes the uniformity via: ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x ∈ K, ∀ h with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ, the remainder is ≤ ε‖h‖^2.
- The code slightly generalizes ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E, which is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- The hypothesis ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U subsumes both “f is C^2” and “H_f is continuous on U,” so this aligns with the assumptions (arguably the original phrasing is redundant, as C^2 already entails continuity of the second derivative).

3) Potential discrepancy:
- Technical subtlety: the theorem uses fderiv ℝ f x (the unrestricted Fréchet derivative at x) and the second derivative via fderiv of the derivative, rather than the within-derivative fderivWithin with respect to U. Since U is not assumed open in the code, ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U does not in general give DifferentiableAt f x (as opposed to DifferentiableWithinAt). For boundary points x ∈ U \ interior(U), fderiv ℝ f x may default to 0 where differentiability fails, which would not match the intended within-U Taylor expansion. This could be fixed by either adding IsOpen U or by replacing fderiv with fderivWithin consistently. If U happens to be open (as is common in statements about C^2), then fderivWithin = fderiv on U and the statement is perfectly aligned.

Final comparison:
- Aside from the within-vs-at derivative technicality when U is not assumed open, the formalization accurately captures the intended theorem, including the uniformity on compact sets and the second-order Taylor remainder estimate with the Hessian term.
- Therefore, this is a near-perfect translation with a minor technical mismatch that could be remedied by assuming U is open or using within derivatives.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- Imports and opens: These bring in Mathlib's measure theory, topology, sets, filters, and interval integrals. They are standard and relevant.
- The theorem statement:
  - Name: tendsto_integral_mul_of_tendsto_uniformly_on_Icc
  - Variables: f : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ (a sequence of real-valued functions on ℝ), f_lim : ℝ → ℝ (the limit function), g : ℝ → ℝ (a continuous function), and a b : ℝ (endpoints of the interval).
  - Hypothesis hg : ContinuousOn g (Icc a b): g is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].
  - Hypothesis h_tendsto : TendstoUniformlyOn f f_lim atTop (Icc a b): f_n → f_lim uniformly on [a, b].
  - Conclusion: Tendsto (fun n => ∫ x in a..b, f n x * g x) atTop (𝓝 (∫ x in a..b, f_lim x * g x)). That is, the sequence of interval integrals of the products f_n · g over [a, b] converges to the integral of f · g over [a, b]. The integral used is the interval (Lebesgue) integral ∫ x in a..b.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Suppose f_n → f uniformly on [a, b] and g is continuous on [a, b]. Prove that lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n g = ∫_a^b f g.
- The Lean code exactly encodes: uniform convergence on [a, b], continuity of g on [a, b], and the conclusion that the integrals of f_n g converge to the integral of f g.
- The choice of intervalIntegral (Lebesgue integral over [a, b] with correct orientation) is a standard formalization for this setting. Using ContinuousOn on Icc a b exactly matches continuity on the closed interval.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The code uses Lebesgue interval integrals, while the natural statement does not specify Riemann vs Lebesgue. On compact intervals with continuous g and uniform convergence, this is a standard and acceptable formalization (a slight generalization), and in Mathlib the interval integral is the canonical one.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all notions are from Mathlib.
- The hypotheses and conclusion match precisely: uniform convergence on [a, b], continuity of g on [a, b], and convergence of the integrals of the products.
- Potential technical subtlety: measurability/integrability are not explicitly assumed in the Lean statement. However, for the purposes of translation fidelity, this is acceptable and typical in Mathlib, and the natural language statement also did not explicitly state integrability assumptions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: setup using Mathlib, opening Complex namespace.
- `theorem exists_entire_log (f : ℂ → ℂ) (h_diff : Differentiable ℂ f) (h_nz : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0) :` states: Let f: ℂ → ℂ be given, assume f is complex-differentiable everywhere (i.e., entire), and f has no zeros anywhere.
- `∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ g ∧ ∀ z, Complex.exp (g z) = f z :=` concludes: there exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ that is complex-differentiable everywhere (i.e., entire) such that for all z, exp(g z) = f z. This is exactly the existence of an entire logarithm of f.
- `by sorry`: proof omitted (allowed for our translation audit).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let f be entire and nonvanishing on ℂ; show there exists holomorphic g with f = e^g.
- Lean statement: Assumes f is Differentiable ℂ (entire) and nonvanishing; concludes existence of g, Differentiable ℂ (entire), with exp ∘ g = f pointwise.
- In Mathlib, `Differentiable ℂ` for maps ℂ → ℂ captures holomorphic/entire. So the hypotheses and conclusion align exactly with the natural-language statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain/codomain: both ℂ → ℂ.
- Entire vs Differentiable ℂ: equivalent in this setting.
- Nonvanishing assumption matches `∀ z, f z ≠ 0`.
- Conclusion matches existence of entire g with exp(g) = f.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; no extra/stronger conditions added; no weakening.

Thus the code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

  This states: For any normed additive commutative group E and sequence a : ℕ → E, if the series of norms ∑ ‖a n‖ is summable (absolute convergence), then for any bijection σ of ℕ (a rearrangement), the topological sum (tsum) of the rearranged series equals the original tsum: tsum (a ∘ σ) = tsum a.

- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions Summable, tsum, and ℕ ≃ ℕ are used. The `:= by sorry` indicates no proof is provided, which is acceptable per the task.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show that for any rearrangement of the series, the sum remains the same.”
- Lean: Assumes absolute convergence via `Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)` and concludes equality of sums for any rearrangement `σ : ℕ ≃ ℕ` via `tsum (a ∘ σ) = tsum a`.
- This is a standard and faithful formalization. Using `tsum` captures the sum of a (summable) series in Mathlib. The rearrangement is encoded by a bijection of ℕ.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing: Lean uses ℕ starting at 0 instead of 1; this is a harmless convention difference.
- Generality: The Lean statement works in any normed additive commutative group E, a standard generalization of the real/complex case, acceptable per guidelines.
- Explicit summability of the rearranged series is not stated as a separate conclusion, but the equality of tsums is the core claim “the sum remains the same.” In Mathlib, from absolute summability one can infer summability (and hence that `tsum` is the actual sum), so this omission does not change the meaning of the claim.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used, and the formalization is faithful to the original mathematical statement.

- `def RiemannIntegrableOn (R : Set ...) (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) : Prop := True`: Define a predicate ""f is Riemann integrable on R"" but set it equal to True for all f and R. This is a vacuous placeholder, not a genuine definition of Riemann integrability on a rectangle.
- `theorem riemann_integrable_on_algebra ...`: If f and g are (by the placeholder) RiemannIntegrableOn R and a ∈ ℝ, then the scalar multiple a • f, the sum f + g, and the product f * g are also RiemannIntegrableOn R. The statement is structured to express closure under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication, i.e., an algebra-like property.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For a closed rectangle R ⊆ ℝ^n, the set of Riemann integrable functions on R is an algebra: if f, g are Riemann integrable on R and a ∈ ℝ, then af, f+g, and fg are Riemann integrable on R.
- The theorem statement in Lean mirrors the closure properties (scalar multiplication, addition, multiplication) given hypotheses that f and g are Riemann integrable on R. However:
  - The core predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` is defined as True, which is a vacuous placeholder and does not encode actual Riemann integrability.
  - The hypothesis that R is a closed rectangle is not encoded explicitly. One might allow that a well-designed predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn R f` implicitly requires R be a (closed) rectangle, but here the predicate is just True, so it carries no information about R.

3) Final comparison:
- Similarities: The shape of the final theorem statement (closure under operations) matches the natural language claim.
- Differences/problems:
  - The key integrability predicate is vacuous (set to True), violating the requirement for a faithful translation.
  - The closed-rectangle assumption on R is not represented. While it could be encapsulated within a proper definition of `RiemannIntegrableOn`, here it is not.
  - Auxiliary definition is vacuous, which is explicitly disallowed by the guidelines.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation due to the vacuous placeholder for Riemann integrability (and the missing encoding of the rectangle condition). If the placeholder were replaced by a legitimate integrability predicate (possibly incorporating the rectangle condition), the theorem statement would essentially match the natural language statement. Hence, it merits a mid-range score for structure but fails faithfulness.

- `theorem mstar_union_le {mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal}`: We fix an arbitrary set function `mstar` from subsets of R^n to extended nonnegative reals.
- Hypothesis `h_sub : ∀ (s : ℕ → Set (Fin n → ℝ)), mstar (⋃ i, s i) ≤ ∑' i, mstar (s i)`: This assumes countable subadditivity of `mstar` for arbitrary sequences of sets.
- `(A B : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : mstar (A ∪ B) ≤ mstar A + mstar B`: The goal is to prove finite subadditivity (for a union of two sets) from countable subadditivity.
- `by sorry`: No proof is provided; the statement is asserted.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The natural language statement: Let `m*` be the outer measure on R^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles. Prove `m*(A ∪ B) ≤ m*(A) + m*(B)` for all sets `A, B`.
- The Lean statement abstracts away the specific construction of `m*` and instead assumes the key property (countable subadditivity) that any outer measure satisfies. It then states the desired inequality for arbitrary sets `A, B`.
- This is a standard and reasonable formalization: the specific construction via open rectangles is not needed to state or derive the two-set subadditivity; countable subadditivity suffices.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Domain: Uses `Set (Fin n → ℝ)` which is Lean’s standard representation of R^n. This matches the intended domain.
- Object: The code uses an arbitrary `mstar` with an explicit countable subadditivity hypothesis, rather than naming the specific outer measure constructed via open rectangles. This is a generalization of the original setting, not a restriction, and captures the essential property needed for the inequality.
- Missing assumptions: The code does not assume `mstar ∅ = 0` or monotonicity, which are part of the outer measure axioms. These are not needed to state the inequality, though typically they are assumed for an “outer measure.” For deriving the inequality directly from the hypothesis by the standard trick `s 0 = A, s 1 = B, s i = ∅`, one would also need `mstar ∅ = 0` to identify the infinite sum with `mstar A + mstar B`. However, since we are auditing the statement (not the proof), and the intended target is the two-set subadditivity for the outer measure, the current hypothesis is very close and the conclusion matches the desired property.
- No vacuous placeholders: There are no fake definitions; `h_sub` is a meaningful property.

Conclusion: The code provides a slightly more general but essentially faithful formalization of the statement’s goal (two-set subadditivity), abstracting away the specific construction of the outer measure. The only notable gap is that it does not tie `mstar` to the specific outer measure defined via open rectangles, and it omits the usual `mstar ∅ = 0` axiom, which would be standard for outer measures and helpful for the proof. Nonetheless, the theorem statement matches the intended mathematical meaning closely enough to count as faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- The theorem `seq_max_limit_nonneg {x : ℕ → ℝ} {l : ℝ} (h : Tendsto x atTop (nhds l))` assumes a real sequence `x : ℕ → ℝ` and a real number `l` such that `x` tends to `l` as `n → ∞` (i.e., `Tendsto x atTop (nhds l)`).
- The conclusion is a conjunction:
  a) `Tendsto (fun n => max (x n) 0) atTop (nhds (max l 0))`: the sequence `y_n = max(x_n, 0)` converges to `max(l, 0)`.
  b) `0 ≤ max l 0`: the number `max(l, 0)` is nonnegative.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let `{x_n}` be convergent and define `y_n = max{x_n, 0}`. Show that `lim y_n ≥ 0`.
- The Lean statement assumes convergence of `x_n` to some `l` and concludes that `y_n` converges to `max(l, 0)` and that this limit is nonnegative. From this, it directly follows that `lim y_n ≥ 0`.
- Hence, the Lean theorem proves a stronger result (identifies the exact limit and shows it is ≥ 0), which implies the requested conclusion. This is an acceptable strengthening and faithful to the original problem.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Both are over real sequences; Lean explicitly uses `ℝ`.
- Assumptions: Convergence of `x_n` is assumed in both; Lean uses the explicit limit `l`.
- Conclusion: The original asks only for nonnegativity of `lim y_n`; Lean proves convergence of `y_n` to `max(l, 0)` and that this limit is ≥ 0. This is a strict strengthening, not a mismatch.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful (indeed stronger) formalization of the natural language statement.

  • mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal: an arbitrary function from sets in R^n to extended nonnegative reals; no structure (like outer measure axioms) is assumed.
  • Rs : Fin k → Set (Fin n → ℝ): a finite family of sets in R^n, indexed by Fin k (so k many sets).
  • h_rect : ∀ i, is_open_rectangle (Rs i): each Rs i satisfies the abstract predicate is_open_rectangle.
  • h_disj : Pairwise (fun i j => Disjoint (Rs i) (Rs j)): the Rs i are pairwise disjoint.
  Conclusion:
  • mstar (⋃ i, Rs i) = ∑ i, mstar (Rs i): the value of mstar on the finite union equals the sum of the values on each set.
  Proof: by sorry (proof omitted).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let m* be the outer measure on R^n. Suppose R_1,...,R_n are pairwise disjoint open rectangles. Prove that m*(⋃ R_k) = ∑ m*(R_k).
Key ingredients in the natural statement:
- m* is an outer measure (so it satisfies the outer measure axioms). Typically one also needs the sets involved (open rectangles) to be measurable for additivity; for Lebesgue outer measure on R^n, open rectangles are measurable.
- R_k are open rectangles, pairwise disjoint.
- Conclusion is finite additivity on this finite disjoint union.

Mismatch analysis:
- The code takes mstar as an arbitrary function Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal, not as an OuterMeasure (Fin n → ℝ). This is a crucial discrepancy: the conclusion asserts additivity for all such functions, which is far stronger than (and not implied by) being an outer measure. Thus the Lean statement is not faithful.
- The predicate is_open_rectangle is completely abstract and unused in the conclusion; no measurability or any property of rectangles is connected to mstar. In the natural statement, the fact that the sets are open rectangles matters to justify measurability and hence additivity. In the Lean code, that hypothesis is present but irrelevant.
- Indexing: the Lean code uses Fin k for the family size; the natural statement uses R_1,...,R_n but also uses n for the ambient dimension. This is just a naming clash; using k for the number of rectangles is fine.
- The theorem ends with by sorry; proofs can be omitted per the task, but the main issue is the theorem statement itself lacks the correct structure on mstar.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean theorem claims additivity for any set function mstar on any family of pairwise disjoint sets satisfying an arbitrary predicate is_open_rectangle, with no requirement that mstar be an outer measure or that rectangles be measurable relative to it. The natural statement is about a specific outer measure (on R^n), and open rectangles (measurable), yielding finite additivity. The Lean code is therefore not a faithful translation.

Additional issues:
- The abstract is_open_rectangle predicate is acceptable as a placeholder only if tied to properties needed for the conclusion; here it is unused, making the hypothesis superfluous.
- A faithful Lean formalization should declare mstar : OuterMeasure (Fin n → ℝ) and either assume measurability of the rectangles (e.g., that open rectangles are Carathéodory-measurable for this outer measure) or specify that m* is the Lebesgue outer measure if that is intended.

Conclusion: The translation fails to capture the essential mathematical content.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- noncomputable section: Allows noncomputable definitions.
- def f (z : ℂ) : ℂ := 1 / (z ^ 2 + 1): Defines f as a complex function f(z) = 1/(z^2+1). This matches the intended function (over ℂ rather than ℝ, which is a reasonable generalization).
- def coeff (n : ℕ) : ℂ := if n % 2 = 0 then (-1 : ℂ) ^ (n / 2) else 0: Defines a sequence of coefficients a_n equal to (-1)^(n/2) for even n and 0 for odd n. This corresponds to the coefficients of the series ∑ (-1)^k z^(2k).
- theorem coeff_formula ... := rfl: A trivial restatement of the definition.
- theorem exists_power_series_at_zero : ∃ (a : ℕ → ℂ) (r : ℝ), (∀ n, a n = coeff n) ∧ r = 1 := ...: Asserts the existence of some sequence a equal to coeff and some real r equal to 1. This does not mention f, convergence, or power series—it's vacuous with respect to the target claim. It merely says “there exists a sequence (namely coeff) and a number r=1”. No link to f or analyticity.
- theorem f_is_analytic_at_zero : True := by sorry: States the proposition True and leaves it with sorry. This does not assert that f is analytic; it is a placeholder and vacuous.
- theorem power_series_representation_and_radius : True := by sorry: Again, a placeholder stating True with sorry; it does not encode any specific statement about the power series of f or its radius of convergence.
- A comment remark informally states the expected result: for |z|<1, 1/(1+z^2) = ∑ (-1)^n z^(2n) with radius 1 due to poles at ±i. But this is only a comment, not formalized.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the original statement?
- The original asks to show f is analytic and to find a power series at 0 with its radius of convergence.
- The code defines f and the intended coefficients, but never proves or even states that f is analytic, nor that f equals the sum of the series with those coefficients in any disk, nor that the radius is 1. The only theorems are vacuous (True) or an unrelated existence of some sequence and number 1 without connection to f or convergence. Thus it does not faithfully translate the statement.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - Analyticity: The code does not assert or prove that f is analytic; it only has a placeholder theorem asserting True.
  - Power series representation: The code does not state that f(z) equals ∑ a_n z^n in a neighborhood of 0. The “exists_power_series_at_zero” theorem is unrelated to f and merely asserts existence of a sequence equal to coeff and r=1.
  - Radius of convergence: Not tied to f; again only an arbitrary r=1 is asserted with no connection to convergence or singularities of f.
  - Domain: The code uses ℂ instead of ℝ, which would be a fine generalization if the rest were correct, but the core claims are missing.
- There are also placeholders with sorry, and the crucial statements are replaced by True, which are vacuous.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable (aq : ℕ → ℚ)`: Fixes a sequence aq of rational numbers indexed by natural numbers. This models the given enumeration {a_k} of the rationals (the code allows any sequence; being a full enumeration is not used by the result and is not necessary).
- `noncomputable def f (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x / (1 + (n * x) ^ 2)`: Defines f_n(x) = x / (1 + (n x)^2) for each n and real x, matching the statement.
- `noncomputable def g (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ := Finset.sum (Finset.range n) fun k => (1 / 2 : ℝ) ^ (k + 1) * f n (x - (aq (k + 1) : ℝ))`: Defines g_n(x) as a finite sum over k = 0..n-1 of (1/2)^(k+1) * f_n(x - a_{k+1}). Reindexing j = k+1 gives sum from j = 1 to n of 2^{-j} f_n(x - a_j), exactly as in the statement.
- `theorem g_tends_to_zero_uniformly : TendstoUniformly (fun n => g n) (fun _ => 0) atTop := by sorry`: States that the sequence of functions g_n converges uniformly to 0 on ℝ as n → ∞ (encoded as TendstoUniformly to the zero function along the filter atTop on ℕ). This matches “Show that g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ.”

Faithfulness assessment:
- Definitions of f_n and g_n are faithful to the given formulas, including the shift by a_k and the weights 2^{-k} (handled via index shift k+1 in Lean).
- The conclusion uses Mathlib’s standard notion of uniform convergence (TendstoUniformly ... atTop), which is the precise formalization of uniform convergence on ℝ.
- The only slight difference is that the code allows any sequence aq : ℕ → ℚ, not specifically requiring it to enumerate all rationals. This is a benign generalization because the uniform convergence proof does not rely on aq being surjective or injective; it works for any sequence. Per the guidelines, such a slight generalization is acceptable.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; f and g are genuine definitions. The theorem’s proof is omitted (sorry), but we are auditing translation fidelity, not proving it.

Final check: The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical meaning (up to the harmless generalization of aq). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  min l 0 ≤ 0 := by sorry
",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: We use Mathlib's mathematics library.
- Theorem min_seq_tendsto_min: For a real sequence x : ℕ → ℝ with limit l (expressed as Filter.Tendsto x atTop (nhds l)), the sequence y_n := min(x n, 0) tends to min(l, 0). This is the formal statement that the map t ↦ min(t, 0) is continuous and preserves limits.
- Theorem min_seq_limit_le_zero: Under the same assumption that x tends to l, it concludes min l 0 ≤ 0. Note: the hypothesis hx is not actually needed for this inequality; it is a general property of min.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let {x_n} be convergent and define y_n = min{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≤ 0.
- The first theorem is stronger than required: it asserts that y_n converges and identifies its limit as min(l, 0). From this, it immediately follows that lim y_n = min(l, 0) ≤ 0.
- The second theorem states min(l, 0) ≤ 0 independently (though it includes the convergence hypothesis unnecessarily). Combined with the first theorem, we get exactly the desired conclusion lim y_n ≤ 0.

Step 3: Compare the two problems carefully.
- Domain/codomain: The Lean code works with real sequences, matching the typical interpretation of the natural language statement.
- Convergence assumption: The Lean code assumes a specific limit l, which is the formalization of the sequence being convergent.
- Conclusion: The natural statement only asks for lim y_n ≤ 0. The Lean code provides a stronger statement (y_n → min l 0) and separately the inequality min l 0 ≤ 0. While the second theorem does not explicitly state “lim y_n ≤ 0,” the first theorem identifies the limit of y_n as min l 0, so the desired conclusion follows immediately. Minor nit: the second theorem’s hypothesis hx is unused in the conclusion, but this does not affect faithfulness.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful and even stronger than required. The only slight mismatch is that the final formal statement provided for the inequality mentions only min l 0 ≤ 0 rather than explicitly “lim y_n ≤ 0,” but the preceding theorem bridges this gap.

- Major issues:
  - All key notions (closed set, closed rectangle, Riemann integrable, outer measure zero, integral) are replaced by vacuous placeholders (True or constant 0). This makes the statement meaningless in the intended sense.
  - The integral is defined to be 0 for all functions and sets, trivializing the conclusion.
  - f and g are modeled as functions on all of ℝ^n ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ), not as functions on R. This can be acceptable as a slight generalization, but it deviates from the original domain R → ℝ.
  - The existence of E ⊂ R is not encoded; the code does not assert E ⊆ R. It only uses the predicate is_closed_set E (in ambient space) and equality on R \ E. The original requires E is a closed subset of R with outer measure zero. The code also makes outer_measure_zero depend on R (outer_measure_zero E R), which is nonstandard.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Due to the pervasive use of vacuous placeholder definitions, the Lean code does not legitimately or faithfully formalize the mathematical content. Even if the overall shape of the theorem statement resembles the natural language claim, the auxiliary definitions render it non-faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context fixes real sequences x, λ : ℕ → ℝ.
- Hypothesis h_sum: ∃ M, ∀ n, |∑ i in range (n+1), x i| ≤ M. This states the partial sums of the series ∑ x_n are uniformly bounded in absolute value. The use of range (n+1) means the partial sum from i = 0 to n; this is a harmless indexing shift compared to starting at 1.
- Hypothesis hλ: ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n, n ≥ N → |λ_ n| ≤ ε. This is exactly λ_n → 0 in ℝ.
- Hypothesis h_tsum: Summable fun n => |λ_ (n+1) - λ_ n|. This states that the series ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges (is summable), i.e., the total variation of λ is summable.
- Conclusion: Summable fun n => λ_ n * x n. This is precisely that the series ∑ λ_n x_n converges.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For a series ∑ x_n with bounded partial sums, λ_n → 0, and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| convergent, show ∑ λ_n x_n converges.
- Lean statement matches exactly: bounded partial sums of x, λ → 0, summable total variation of λ, conclude summability of ∑ λ_n x_n.

Technical nuances:
- Indexing starts at 0 in Lean vs 1 in the natural statement—this is a standard, immaterial shift.
- The Lean code specializes to real-valued sequences; the natural statement is typically over ℝ (or ℂ). This is a harmless specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem is a direct formalization of the statement. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is allowed for this auditing task.

  Interpretation: If each f_n is continuous and f_n → g uniformly on each [−k, k] (equivalently, uniformly on compact subsets of ℝ), then g is continuous on ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language definition specifies: “a sequence f_n converges uniformly on compact subsets if for every k ∈ ℕ the sequence f_n converges uniformly on [−k, k].” The Lean definition exactly encodes “uniform on [−k, k] for every k” with the standard ε–N quantifiers, and explicitly includes the target function g, which is the standard formalization of uniform convergence.
- The theorem states: If each f_n is continuous and the convergence is uniform on compact subsets, then the limit (g) is continuous on ℝ. This matches the natural statement (“the limit is continuous on ℝ”).
- Using [−k, k] to model compact subsets is legitimate on ℝ because every compact K ⊆ ℝ is contained in some [−k, k], and uniform convergence on a larger set implies uniform convergence on subsets, so the definition is equivalent to the usual “uniform on compact sets” in ℝ.

- The Lean code makes explicit the limit function g, whereas the natural language states “the limit,” implicitly referring to such a function. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- The definition via [−k, k] is exactly what the natural language states. No vacuous placeholders are used; the auxiliary definition is meaningful.
- No extraneous assumptions or weakenings are introduced.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter Topology Complex`: bring in standard libraries and namespaces.
- Docstring describes the intended theorem: a function f given by a convergent power series around 0 (there exists R > 0 such that for all z with |z| < R, the series ∑ a_k z^k converges to f z). A sequence (z_n) of nonzero complex numbers converges to 0, all z_n lie in the disk of convergence, and f(z_n) = 0 for all n. Then every coefficient a_k is 0.
- The theorem `power_series_coeffs_zero_of_zeros` has parameters: `a : ℕ → ℂ` (coefficients), `f : ℂ → ℂ` (function), `z : ℕ → ℂ` (sequence), a radius `R : ℝ` with `hR : 0 < R`.
- Hypothesis `hseries : ∀ w : ℂ, dist w 0 < R → HasSum (fun k => a k * w ^ k) (f w)`: For every w with |w| < R, the series ∑ a_k w^k converges to f(w). This formalizes that f equals its power series on the open disk of radius R centered at 0.
- `hz_nonzero : ∀ n, z n ≠ 0`: each term of the sequence is nonzero.
- `hz_lim : Tendsto z atTop (𝓝 (0 : ℂ))`: z_n → 0.
- `hz_in : ∀ n, dist (z n) 0 < R`: each z_n lies within the disk of convergence.
- `hz_zero : ∀ n, f (z n) = 0`: f(z_n) = 0 for all n.
- Conclusion: `∀ k, a k = 0`: every coefficient is zero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: f(z) = ∑ a_k z^k is a convergent power series, and {z_n} is a sequence of nonzero complex numbers converging to 0 with f(z_n) = 0 for all n; show a_k = 0 for all k. The Lean hypothesis `hseries` formalizes that f is given by its power series on some open disk (i.e., there exists R > 0 with convergence and equality), which is the standard interpretation of “a convergent power series around 0.”
- The requirement `hz_in` that each z_n lies in the disk of convergence is an explicit technical condition ensuring the identity f(w) = sum holds at all z_n. This is consistent with the usual meaning that f is defined by the power series on its domain (the disk), and hence the z_n used in f(z_n) must lie in that domain. It is not a vacuous strengthening; it matches the context and is a standard formalization detail.
- The other conditions (nonzero sequence, tends to 0, zeros of f at these points) match exactly.
- The conclusion matches exactly: all coefficients a_k are zero.

3) Final check: The mathematical content is the same. There are no vacuous placeholders or fake definitions; Mathlib concepts (HasSum, Tendsto, dist) are used properly. The only additional explicit assumption (z_n in the disk) aligns with the intended domain of the power series and does not change the problem. Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code works in a general finite-dimensional real normed vector space E (so it generalizes ℝ^n). It assumes:
  - E is a finite-dimensional normed real vector space.
  - U ⊆ E is convex: hU : Convex ℝ U.
  - f : E → ℝ is C^2 on U: hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U.
- The theorem states: For every compact K with K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all a ∈ K and all h with a + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ, we have
  | f(a + h) − f(a) − (fderiv ℝ f a) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ f) a) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
- Here fderiv ℝ f a is the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map) at a, and fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ f) a is the derivative of the derivative (a bilinear form after applying to h then to h), i.e. the Hessian in finite dimensions. The inequality expresses that the remainder in the second-order Taylor expansion is o(‖h‖^2), uniformly in a over K.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 and H_f (the Hessian) continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor remainder is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The code matches the core content:
  - Domain/codomain match (E finite-dimensional over ℝ generalizes ℝ^n).
  - U is convex.
  - Regularity: ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U encapsulates C^2 on U (including continuity of the Hessian on U).
  - Uniformity on compact subsets is expressed by: ∀ K compact, K ⊆ U, ∀ ε>0, ∃ δ>0, ∀ a ∈ K, ∀ h with a+h∈U and ‖h‖<δ, the remainder ≤ ε‖h‖^2.
  - The Taylor polynomial terms are written with fderiv and its derivative, matching the gradient and Hessian usage in ℝ^n.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- Within vs ambient derivative: The code uses the ambient derivatives fderiv ℝ f a and fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ f) a. However, the hypotheses only assume ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (regularity on U), not that f is C^2 in an open neighborhood of a or globally. If a lies on the boundary of U, ContDiffOn on U gives within derivatives, but not necessarily ambient derivatives at a. In mathlib, fderiv is defined unconditionally (defaulting to 0 when not differentiable), so the expression might not represent the true derivative if ambient differentiability fails at boundary points. For a perfectly faithful formalization when U is not assumed open, one would typically use fderivWithin and the second within-derivative, or assume U is open (or assume f is globally C^2). The natural language statement says “f is C^2 and H_f continuous in a convex set U,” which is commonly read as f being globally C^2 (hence ambient derivatives exist); the code assumes only ContDiffOn on U, which is weaker but then uses ambient derivatives. This is a subtle mismatch.
- Openness of U: The natural statement does not assert U is open; the code also does not assume openness, only convexity. This is fine, but it interacts with the previous point: without openness or global C^2, ambient fderiv may not coincide with the within derivative.
- Generality: The code slightly generalizes from ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional real normed space; this is acceptable and faithful in spirit.

Conclusion: The statement is essentially captured: second-order Taylor remainder is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U, under C^2 regularity with continuous Hessian on U, in a convex set. The main discrepancy is the use of ambient derivatives fderiv rather than within-set derivatives while only assuming ContDiffOn on U (and not assuming U is open or f is globally C^2). This is a subtle but real mismatch, so it’s not perfectly faithful, but it is very close.

- def E (n : ℕ) := Fin n → ℝ: Define E n as the n-dimensional Euclidean space modeled as functions from Fin n to ℝ.
- def closed_rectangle {n : ℕ} (a b : E n) : Set (E n) := Set.Icc a b: Define a closed rectangle as the axis-aligned box [a, b] = {x | a ≤ x ≤ b} in R^n.
- variable (IsJordanMeasurable : ∀ {n : ℕ}, Set (E n) → Prop): Introduce an abstract predicate for Jordan measurability of subsets of E n.
- theorem exists_finite_closed_rectangles_cover_disjoint ...: Given U, S ⊆ E n with U open (hU), S compact (hS_compact), S Jordan measurable (hS_jordan), and S ⊆ U (hSsub), there exists a finite set P of pairs (a, b) in E n × E n such that:
  - ∀ p ∈ P, p.fst ≤ p.snd: each pair defines a legitimate (possibly degenerate) rectangle Icc a b.
  - ∀ p ∈ P, closed_rectangle p.fst p.snd ⊆ U: each rectangle is contained in U.
  - S ⊆ ⋃ p ∈ P, closed_rectangle p.fst p.snd: S is covered by the finite union of these rectangles.
  - ∀ p q ∈ P, p ≠ q → interior(Icc p.fst p.snd) ∩ interior(Icc q.fst q.snd) = ∅: the interiors of distinct rectangles are pairwise disjoint.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language: For U ⊆ R^n open and S ⊆ U compact and Jordan measurable, there exist finitely many closed rectangles P_1, ..., P_k ⊆ U such that S ⊆ ⋃ P_j and interiors are mutually disjoint.

The Lean statement matches this precisely:
- R^n is modeled by E n; rectangles are closed Icc sets.
- Finite family is a Finset of pairs (a, b), each defining a rectangle.
- Each rectangle is contained in U.
- The union covers S.
- Interiors are pairwise disjoint (expressed as intersection equals ∅ for distinct indices).
- The hypothesis that S is Jordan measurable is included as an abstract predicate, which corresponds to the natural language assumption.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The code adds the condition p.fst ≤ p.snd to ensure rectangles are well-defined (nonempty or degenerate), which is standard and consistent with “closed rectangles.” This does not weaken or change the statement.
- Jordan measurability is treated as an abstract predicate rather than a concrete Mathlib definition, but it is not vacuous and faithfully reflects the assumption in the statement. It is an extra hypothesis that matches the natural language.
- Using equality to ∅ for interior intersections is equivalent to “mutually disjoint interiors.”

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: U ⊂ ℝ^n open, f : U → ℝ differentiable, and if f is convex on U, then for all x,y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], f(tx+(1−t)y) ≤ t f(x) + (1−t) f(y).
- The Lean statement mirrors this: it assumes U open, f differentiable on U, and f convex on U, and concludes the convexity inequality for x,y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1].
- The use of E as a general real normed vector space instead of ℝ^n is a standard slight generalization, not a mismatch.
- Mathlib’s ConvexOn ℝ U f matches the intended meaning of “f is convex on U.” The function is typed as f : E → ℝ instead of f : U → ℝ, but the property and inequality are restricted to x,y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], which faithfully captures the intended statement. The extra assumptions (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn) reflect the natural language hypotheses (even though they aren’t needed to derive convexity inequality, they are present as in the statement).

3) Final check and differences:
- Differences:
  • Domain generalization: E is an arbitrary real normed vector space instead of ℝ^n. Acceptable slight generalization.
  • Function typing: f : E → ℝ with restriction to U via DifferentiableOn and ConvexOn, instead of f : U → ℝ. This is a common formalization choice and remains faithful to the content.

- `(ha : Summable fun n => abs (a n)) (hb : Summable fun n => abs (b n))`: Assume the series ∑ |a n| and ∑ |b n| are summable, i.e., a and b are absolutely summable.
- Conclusion is a conjunction:
  - `Summable (fun n => abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)))`: The series ∑ |c n| is summable, where `c n = ∑_{k=0}^n a k * b (n - k)`. This asserts absolute convergence of the Cauchy product sequence c.
  - `(∑' n, Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)) = (∑' n, a n) * (∑' n, b n)`: The sum over n of c n equals the product of the sums of a and b. Here `∑'` denotes the infinite sum (tsum) in Mathlib. The finite inner sum uses `Finset.range (n+1)` so k runs from 0 to n, and `n - k` is the natural subtraction which equals the usual difference for k ≤ n.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Given absolutely convergent series ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n, define c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}; then ∑ c_n converges absolutely and equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- The Lean theorem assumes absolute summability of a and b via `Summable (abs ∘ a)` and `Summable (abs ∘ b)`, defines c_n implicitly as the finite convolution sum, asserts absolute summability of c (Summable of |c_n|), and asserts the equality of the total sums. This matches exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing and definition of c_n are identical: k from 0 to n, using a_k b_{n-k}.
- Absolute convergence and product equality are both stated.
- The code specializes to real sequences ℝ, while the natural language is general; this is an acceptable slight specialization per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The statement asks to prove: (a) f is analytic; (b) find a power series for f at 0; (c) find its radius of convergence.
- The code defines f correctly and provides an explicit series with coefficients a_n = Re((1+i)^n)/n!, which is a correct Maclaurin expansion for e^x cos x. It also states that the series converges to f(x) for all x (HasSum everywhere), which shows radius of convergence is ∞.
- Regarding analyticity: While there is no explicit statement like ""f is analytic"" (e.g., AnalyticAt or RealAnalytic), the theorems give a stronger fact: f equals its Maclaurin series for all x and the series converges everywhere. This implies real-analyticity on ℝ. So, in mathematical meaning, the code captures the analytic property through a stronger assertion.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- Power series at 0: Fully and correctly provided via a_n and the equality f = ∑ a_n x^n.
- Radius of convergence: Explicitly encoded by convergence for all x (infinite radius).
- Analyticity: Not stated in Mathlib's formal predicate form, but logically implied by the provided equalities; thus the content matches, albeit not in the exact formal phrasing.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: all auxiliary definitions are meaningful; no cheating.

Overall, the translation is accurate. The only minor gap is the absence of an explicit ""analytic"" predicate, but the provided theorems imply it strongly. Hence, it's essentially faithful.

- The code slightly generalizes to allow the 0-by-0 case (since `Fintype.card n` could be 0), but the identity still holds and does not contradict the original statement. This is acceptable and common in formalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; it relies on Mathlib’s `adjugate` and determinant.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- `theorem isOpen_iff_forall_exists_ball {α : Type _} [PseudoMetricSpace α] {s : Set α} :`: We fix a type α equipped with a pseudometric space structure and a subset s ⊆ α, and state a theorem.
- `IsOpen s ↔ ∀ p ∈ s, ∃ ε > 0, Metric.ball p ε ⊆ s :=`: The statement is that s is open if and only if for every point p in s there exists ε > 0 such that the open ball centered at p with radius ε is contained in s.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted (not relevant for translation faithfulness).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: In a metric space, S is open if and only if for every p ∈ S there exists ε > 0 with B(p, ε) ⊆ S. The Lean statement matches this exactly, with the standard formalization: IsOpen s ↔ ∀ p ∈ s, ∃ ε > 0, Metric.ball p ε ⊆ s. The only small difference is that Lean assumes a PseudoMetricSpace instead of a MetricSpace; this is a slight generalization and is standard/acceptable since the property holds equally for pseudometrics.

3) Final check:
- Concept of openness: identical.
- Quantifiers and conditions: identical (∀ p ∈ s, ∃ ε > 0 ...).
- Ball used is the open ball: Metric.ball corresponds to the usual open ball B(p, ε).
- Space assumption: PseudoMetricSpace vs MetricSpace is a harmless generalization.
No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It fixes real coefficients c : ℕ → ℝ, a center a : ℝ, and a radius ρ : ℝ with hρ : 0 < ρ.
- Assumption hs: for every x with |x − a| < ρ, the series ∑ c n (x − a)^n is summable (i.e., convergent). This encodes convergence on the open ball of radius ρ, but does not say anything about behavior outside the ball nor assert that ρ is the actual radius of convergence.
- Conclusion: for every x with |x − a| < ρ, the function y ↦ ∑' n, c n * (y − a)^n has a derivative at x, and the derivative equals ∑' n, (n + 1) * c (n + 1) * (x − a)^n. In other words, the term-by-term differentiated series gives the derivative inside the given ball. The statement is expressed via HasDerivAt and uses the summation ∑' (tsum) at the evaluation point x for the derivative series.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let ∑ c_n (x−a)^n be a power series with radius of convergence 0<ρ≤∞, let I be as above, and let f be its sum. Then f is differentiable and f'(x) = ∑ (n+1) c_{n+1} (x−a)^n, with radius of convergence equal to ρ.”
- The code matches these parts:
  - Uses the open ball I = {x | |x − a| < ρ} implicitly via the hypothesis and conclusion quantifiers.
  - Defines f as the sum via tsum and asserts differentiability on I with the expected derivative formula.
- Differences:
  - The code does not formalize “radius of convergence equal to ρ” for the original series. It only assumes convergence on the open ball of radius ρ (i.e., radius at least ρ), with no statement about divergence outside, so it does not encode that ρ is the exact radius.
  - Crucially, the code does not assert that the differentiated power series has the same radius ρ. The docstring claims this, but the theorem statement itself does not include any radius-of-convergence conclusion.
  - The natural language allows ρ = ∞; the code takes ρ : ℝ with 0 < ρ, so it excludes the infinite-radius case. This is a slight specialization.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- The core differentiability and derivative formula on the disc are captured faithfully.
- However, the important clause “with radius of convergence equal to ρ” for the differentiated series is missing from the formal statement. Also, the code doesn’t assert that the original series actually has radius exactly ρ (only convergence on the disc is assumed). The exclusion of the infinite-radius case is a mild specialization.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is missing a key part of the original statement (equality of radii), so it is not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- `constant RiemannIntegrableOn (n : ℕ) (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop`: Introduces, as an axiom (no definition), a predicate saying that a function f: ℝ^n → ℝ is Riemann integrable ""on"" a set R ⊆ ℝ^n.
- Theorem `max_min_riemann_integrable`: For any n, any set R ⊆ ℝ^n, and any functions f, g: ℝ^n → ℝ, if f and g are RiemannIntegrableOn n over R, then both max(f, g) and min(f, g) are RiemannIntegrableOn n over R. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The original statement: Let R ⊆ ℝ^n be a closed rectangle and f, g: R → ℝ be Riemann integrable. Then φ(x)=max{f(x), g(x)} and ψ(x)=min{f(x), g(x)} are Riemann integrable on R.

Discrepancies:
- The code does not encode the crucial hypothesis that R is a closed rectangle; it allows an arbitrary set R.
- The predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` is declared as a `constant` with no definition, i.e., a vacuous placeholder not tied to Mathlib’s actual notion of Riemann integrability. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- The functions in the code are from ℝ^n to ℝ rather than from R to ℝ; while often acceptable via a restriction predicate, this is bundled into the (vacuous) predicate and not a faithful match by itself.
- The theorem statement returns a conjunction asserting integrability of both max and min, which is fine structurally, but the key geometric assumption (closed rectangle) is missing.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code claims a result for any set R given a placeholder integrability predicate, while the natural language requires R to be a closed rectangle and uses genuine Riemann integrability on R. Even if the placeholder were replaced with a correct definition, the theorem as stated would still omit the essential “closed rectangle” assumption, and thus would not be faithful to the original problem. Moreover, introducing `RiemannIntegrableOn` as an axiom is a vacuous stand-in for Mathlib’s actual concepts.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to vacuous predicate and missing key hypothesis. Even if fixed, the final theorem as stated would still be missing the closed rectangle condition.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: standard imports and namespace opening.
- `variable (harmonic_on : Set (ℝ × ℝ) → (ℝ × ℝ → ℝ) → Prop)`: introduces an arbitrary predicate `harmonic_on U f` meaning “f has some property on U,” intended (by the docstring) to represent harmonicity, but it is not defined in terms of derivatives or Laplacian, and it is not a Mathlib concept.
- The theorem statement:
  - Hypotheses: `U : Set (ℝ × ℝ)`, `IsOpen U`, `IsConnected U` (so U is a connected open subset of ℝ²), `f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ` (a real-valued function on ℝ²), `hf : harmonic_on U f` (assumed predicate), `p ∈ U`, and `hmax : ∀ x ∈ U, f x ≤ f p` (so f attains a global maximum over U at p).
  - Conclusion: `∀ x ∈ U, f x = f p` (f is constant on U).
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Matches:
  - Domain/codomain and set-theoretic context: U ⊆ ℝ², U open and connected; p ∈ U; f attains a maximum at p; conclusion that f is constant on U. Using f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ instead of f : U → ℝ is a harmless formalization choice since all quantifiers are restricted to U.
- Mismatch:
  - The crux of the natural-language statement is that f is harmonic in the specific sense “C² with f_xx + f_yy = 0 on U.” In the Lean code, harmonicity is replaced by an arbitrary, uninterpreted predicate `harmonic_on`. This is not tied to Mathlib's definitions nor to the analytical notion (C² and Laplacian zero). Hence the code’s theorem asserts the maximum principle for any predicate named `harmonic_on`, not specifically for harmonic functions. This changes the meaning and makes the statement not faithful.
  - Furthermore, the code does not use any Mathlib definition of harmonic functions (if present) nor does it define harmonic_on in terms of differentiability and Laplacian.

3) Final comparison:
- The two problems are different. The original requires f to be harmonic (C² and Laplacian zero). The Lean statement requires only an abstract predicate `harmonic_on U f`, so it does not encode the harmonic condition. Everything else (openness, connectedness, maximum at p, and the constant conclusion) aligns. The lack of a faithful definition of harmonicity is the key discrepancy.

Given this, the translation is close in structure but not faithful in the essential hypothesis.

  Let X be a metric space and K ⊆ X be compact. For any ε > 0, there exists a finite set s ⊆ X such that K is contained in the union over x ∈ s of the open ε-balls centered at x; i.e., K ⊆ ⋃_{x ∈ s} B(x, ε). The `Set.Finite s` asserts s is finite. The union `⋃ x ∈ s, Metric.ball x ε` is a finite union of open balls of radius ε. The parameterization `{ε} (ε_pos : 0 < ε)` encodes the universal quantification over ε > 0 by making ε an argument to the theorem.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let (X,d) be a metric space. Suppose K ⊂ X is compact. Prove that K is the union of finitely many open balls of radius ε, for every ε > 0.""
- The Lean statement asserts that for every ε > 0 there is a finite collection of ε-balls whose union covers K, i.e., K ⊆ ⋃ B(x, ε). This matches the standard interpretation of the claim (finite ε-net / total boundedness), which is typically stated as a covering, not strict equality. The centers are allowed anywhere in X, which is standard and does not change the meaning.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- The only potential discrepancy is the phrase ""is the union"" which could be read as equality K = ⋃ B(x, ε). However, in standard mathematical usage for compactness/total boundedness, the intended meaning is that K can be covered by finitely many ε-balls (subset inclusion). Equality would generally be too strong (since the balls extend beyond K unless K is open or one takes intersections with K). Thus, the Lean code captures the intended and correct interpretation.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the code uses Mathlib concepts directly. The theorem is parametrized over arbitrary ε > 0, as required.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the intended natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- The code imports Mathlib.
- The docstring informally states: for a continuous linear map A : X →L[𝕜] Y that is bijective, the inverse is bounded; this can be expressed by saying a continuous linear equivalence has a continuous inverse.
- The actual theorem is:
  - Context: 𝕜 is a normed field; X, Y are normed vector spaces over 𝕜.
  - Hypothesis: A : X ≃L[𝕜] Y, i.e., A is a continuous linear equivalence between X and Y (a linear equivalence that is continuous in both directions).
  - Conclusion: Continuous A.symm, i.e., the inverse function of A (as a function Y → X) is continuous.
  - The proof is left as sorry (which is acceptable per the problem instructions since we're only auditing the statement/translation).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural statement: Let X, Y be normed vector spaces, A ∈ L(X, Y) (a bounded/continuous linear map). If A is one-to-one and onto (bijective), then A^{-1} : Y → X is bounded (equivalently, continuous linear). It suggests using the Open Mapping Theorem or completeness assumptions.
- The Lean theorem assumes A is already a continuous linear equivalence (X ≃L[𝕜] Y). This structure already contains that both A and A.symm are continuous linear maps. Concluding ""Continuous A.symm"" is thus essentially built into the hypothesis/type and is strictly weaker than the intended conclusion (it doesn't even state the inverse is linear or bounded as a continuous linear map; it states mere continuity of the inverse function, although the type A implies more, but the theorem doesn't use or reflect the bijective-CLM-to-CLE equivalence the original problem asks to establish).
- The original asks to start with A : X →L[𝕜] Y and bijectivity (injective + surjective) and conclude that A^{-1} is bounded (i.e., produce a continuous linear map Y →L[𝕜] X). The Lean statement skips the key step (constructing/justifying the boundedness of the inverse) by assuming A is already an equivalence with a continuous inverse.
- The code also omits any mention of completeness or the Open Mapping Theorem, which are central to the requested proof approach.

Step 3: Final comparison
- Differences:
  - Hypotheses: Natural language assumes a bijective continuous linear map A : X →L[𝕜] Y; code assumes a continuous linear equivalence A : X ≃L[𝕜] Y (much stronger, includes continuity of inverse by definition).
  - Conclusion: Natural language wants A^{-1} to be bounded/continuous linear; code only states continuity of A.symm as a function (and does not assert linearity in the theorem statement), and moreover it is tautological given the type X ≃L[𝕜] Y.
  - Method: The original references Open Mapping Theorem/completeness; code does not encode this at all.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the mathematical statement; it trivializes the claim by building the desired conclusion into the hypothesis and weakens the explicit conclusion.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholder definitions, but the statement is significantly altered (stronger assumptions, weaker/tautological conclusion) and does not capture the essence of the original problem. Hence not faithful; assign a low grade (4).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- The theorem is named `monotone_tendsto_eq_eventually_const` and states: Let x : ℕ → ℝ be a sequence of real numbers and let k : ℕ. Assume hx : Monotone x (i.e., x is nondecreasing: n ≤ m ⇒ x n ≤ x m). Assume h : Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 (x k)) (i.e., x_n → x_k as n → ∞). Then the conclusion is: ∀ n, n ≥ k → x n = x k, i.e., for all n ≥ k, x_n equals x_k.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; just a single theorem statement. The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for translation checking.
- `atTop` is the filter describing n → ∞ on ℕ, and `𝓝 (x k)` is the neighborhood filter at x k; thus `Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 (x k))` is exactly lim_{n→∞} x_n = x_k.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: A convergent monotone sequence {x_n}. Suppose there exists k ∈ ℕ with lim x_n = x_k. Show x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k.
- The Lean statement captures:
  - A monotone (specifically, nondecreasing) sequence of real numbers.
  - The limit exists and equals x_k (expressed via Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 (x k))).
  - Concludes eventual constancy from index k onward: ∀ n ≥ k, x n = x k.
- The only potential discrepancy is that in standard mathematics, “monotone” can mean either nondecreasing or nonincreasing, while Lean’s `Monotone` means nondecreasing. The theorem as stated in Lean covers the nondecreasing case. The original statement likely intended both monotone directions; however, specializing to the nondecreasing case is a standard and acceptable slight specialization. Everything else aligns: the type is ℝ (reasonable since monotonicity is stated and typical contexts use real sequences), the limit condition is exactly as stated, and the conclusion matches perfectly.

3) Final check and differences:
- Same core mathematical content: if a monotone sequence converges to one of its terms, then it is eventually constant from that index.
- Differences:
  - Direction of monotonicity: Lean assumes nondecreasing (`Monotone`), whereas the natural language could encompass nonincreasing as well. The nonincreasing case would require `Antitone` in Lean. This is a slight specialization.
  - The Lean code explicitly restricts to real sequences; the natural language did not specify the codomain, but real numbers are the standard intended setting and are sufficient for the statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no red flags. The statement is a faithful formalization up to the noted slight specialization.

Given the slight specialization (increasing vs. either direction), this is almost perfectly faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem measure_zero_of_outer_cover {n : Nat} {X : Set (Fin n → ℝ)}`: We fix a natural number n and a set X of points in ℝ^n (modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`).
- `(m : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: We consider a function m assigning a real number to each subset of ℝ^n.
- `(h_nonneg : ∀ A, 0 ≤ m A)`: m is nonnegative on all sets.
- `(h_mono : ∀ {A B : Set (Fin n → ℝ)}, A ⊆ B → m A ≤ m B)`: m is monotone with respect to inclusion: if A ⊆ B then m(A) ≤ m(B).
- `(h_cover : ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ Y : Set (Fin n → ℝ), X ⊆ Y ∧ m Y ≤ ε)`: For every ε > 0, there exists a superset Y of X with m(Y) ≤ ε.
- Conclusion: `m X = 0`: Under these assumptions, m(X) = 0.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable here since we are auditing the statement/translation.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: For X ⊆ ℝ^n, if for every ε > 0 there exists Y ⊇ X with m*(Y) ≤ ε, where m* is the (Lebesgue) outer measure on ℝ^n, then X has measure zero, i.e., m*(X) = 0.
- The Lean theorem is a slight generalization: it replaces the specific outer measure m* by an arbitrary set function m that is nonnegative and monotone, and assumes the same ε-covering property. From these hypotheses, it concludes m(X) = 0. Since outer measure satisfies nonnegativity and monotonicity, the Lean statement implies the original as a special case.
- The domain `Set (Fin n → ℝ)` is the standard Lean model for subsets of ℝ^n, so that matches the context.
- The codomain of m is ℝ rather than [0, ∞] or ℝ≥0∞, but given the hypothesis that for every ε > 0 there is a Y with m(Y) ≤ ε, m(Y) must be finite in those cases; thus working in ℝ is a harmless specialization for this lemma.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
- The Lean statement is a generalization that still captures the original situation exactly when m is taken to be the outer measure m*. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all assumptions are meaningful and standard for outer measures.
- Therefore, the two mathematical statements are essentially the same, with the Lean version slightly more general but faithful to the natural language statement.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions, no misuse of placeholders, hypotheses accurately reflect the needed properties (nonnegativity, monotonicity, ε-cover), and the conclusion matches the claim. The generalization is acceptable and standard. Hence, faithful.

- Hypotheses: hU : IsOpen U (U is an open subset of ℝ^n). hf : ContinuousOn f U (f is continuous on U, viewed as a function defined on all of ℝ^n but continuous on U).
- Statement: The Lebesgue measure (volume) on ((Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ) of the set Function.graph f ∩ (U ×ˢ univ) equals 0.
  • Here Function.graph f = {(x, y) | y = f x} (the full graph of f on all of ℝ^n).
  • Intersecting with U ×ˢ univ restricts to {(x, f x) | x ∈ U}, i.e., the graph over U.
  • Thus the theorem asserts that the graph of f over U has Lebesgue measure zero in ℝ^n × ℝ = ℝ^{n+1}.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: Let U ⊆ ℝ^n be open and f: U → ℝ continuous. Let G = {(x, f(x)) ∈ ℝ^{n+1} : x ∈ U}. Show G has measure zero in ℝ^{n+1}.
- Lean statement: Exactly the same set G is expressed as Function.graph f ∩ (U ×ˢ univ), and the measure used is the Lebesgue measure (volume) on ℝ^n × ℝ. The continuity condition is encoded as ContinuousOn f U, which is the standard way to express continuity of a function defined on all of ℝ^n when restricted to U; this matches the natural f: U → ℝ continuous.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain of f: The natural language has f defined only on U; the Lean code has f defined on all of ℝ^n but only assumes continuity on U. This is a standard and faithful formalization; the set being measured depends only on the restriction to U (due to the intersection with U × univ). No substantive difference.
- Ambient space: The natural language uses ℝ^{n+1}; the Lean code uses the product (ℝ^n) × ℝ with Lebesgue volume, which is canonically the same measure space. No substantive difference.
- The set measured: Function.graph f ∩ (U ×ˢ univ) equals {(x, f x) | x ∈ U} = G. Exactly matches.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct. The presence of `sorry` for the proof does not affect faithfulness of the statement translation.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate symbol meant to represent “(Riemann) integrable on [a,b]”, but it is not defined; it could denote anything.
- `variable (RiemannIntegral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)` introduces an arbitrary function symbol meant to represent the Riemann integral over [a,b], but again it is not defined; it could denote anything.
- The theorem `uniform_limit_of_riemann_integrable` takes:
  - `f : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ` (a sequence of functions), `f_lim : ℝ → ℝ` (the limit function), and `a b : ℝ` (interval endpoints);
  - `h_int : ∀ n, RiemannIntegrableOn (f n) a b` (each f_n is integrable on [a,b] with respect to the abstract predicate);
  - `h_uniform : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x ∈ Icc a b, |f n x - f_lim x| < ε` (uniform convergence on [a,b]);
  and concludes
  - `RiemannIntegrableOn f_lim a b ∧ Tendsto (fun n => RiemannIntegral (f n) a b) atTop (nhds (RiemannIntegral f_lim a b))` (the limit function is integrable w.r.t. the abstract predicate, and the integrals converge to the integral of the limit, expressed via topological convergence).
  The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- Conceptually, the structure mirrors the classical theorem: If f_n are Riemann integrable on [a,b] and converge uniformly to f, then f is Riemann integrable and the integrals converge to the integral of f.
- However, the crucial terms `RiemannIntegrableOn` and `RiemannIntegral` are not tied to Mathlib’s actual definitions; they are arbitrary variables, not definitions. Thus the statement is about an arbitrary predicate and an arbitrary functional, not the Riemann integral. This makes the statement vacuous as a translation: it does not assert anything specifically about Riemann integrability.
- The uniform convergence hypothesis is correctly formalized on `Icc a b` using absolute value, which is appropriate.
- The conclusion uses `Tendsto ... nhds` to express the limit, which is a faithful way to encode `lim ∫ f_n = ∫ f` in Lean.
- There is no assumption `a ≤ b`. While many formulations of the Riemann integral expect `a ≤ b`, some conventions define the integral for any `a, b`. But since the integrability and integral predicates are abstract here, this is secondary to the larger issue that they are not tied to the Riemann theory at all.

3) Final comparison: same or different?
- Different in a critical way. The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s Riemann integration notions and instead introduces completely unconstrained placeholders. Therefore, even though the shape of the theorem matches the natural statement, it does not legitimately assert the Riemann integrability result, and so it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Other notes per guidelines:
- Auxiliary symbols are vacuous placeholders (as arbitrary variables) rather than faithful definitions; this is a red flag and fails the translation requirement.
- If these placeholders were replaced by the appropriate Mathlib definitions (e.g., a concrete Riemann integrability predicate and integral functional) and possibly with an assumption like `a ≤ b`, the theorem statement would be faithful.

Given this, the translation is not faithful. The best-fit grade per rubric is that it makes up vacuous definitions but the intended final theorem would be faithful if those were fixed.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient space E is a real normed vector space with a normed additive commutative group structure and a finite-dimensional real vector space structure. This models R^n in Mathlib.
- The theorem fderiv_uniform_o_small_on_compact takes:
  • U : Set E, with hU_convex : Convex ℝ U (U is convex).
  • f : E → E, with h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f U (f is Frechet differentiable at every point of U).
  • h_cont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) U (the derivative map x ↦ fderiv f x is continuous on U).
  It claims: For every compact K ⊆ U, and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, we have
    ‖f (x + h) - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) h‖ ≤ ε · ‖h‖.
  This is the standard uniform little-o estimate: the remainder is bounded by ε times ‖h‖, uniformly over x in K, provided the step h keeps us inside U.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let F : R^n → R^n be differentiable and suppose DF exists and is continuous on a convex set U. Show that ‖F(x+h) − F(x) − DF(x)h‖ = o(‖h‖) uniformly on compact subsets of U as h → 0.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes:
  • E finite-dimensional real normed space stands for R^n.
  • f : E → E is differentiable on U and fderiv is continuous on U.
  • Uniformity on compact subsets K ⊆ U: for every ε>0, there exists δ>0 independent of x ∈ K such that the remainder ≤ ε‖h‖ for all h with ‖h‖<δ and x+h ∈ U.
- The condition x + h ∈ U is a natural technical constraint: since the continuity of the derivative is assumed only on U, the estimate is guaranteed for increments that stay in U. This matches the intended meaning of “as h → 0” within the domain where the hypotheses (continuity of DF) hold. In usual analysis statements, either U is open or one quantifies only over h with x+h ∈ U; the Lean version makes this explicit and is consistent with standard formulations.
- The inequality form ≤ ε‖h‖ is the epsilon–delta form of the little-o relation, and uniformity in x over K is explicitly encoded by δ depending only on K and ε.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; all notions (DifferentiableOn, ContinuousOn, fderiv, Convex, IsCompact) are standard Mathlib.
- The Lean theorem slightly generalizes the statement from R^n to any finite-dimensional real normed space E, which is acceptable and faithful.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are mathematically the same in content, with the Lean version a standard, slightly more general, and more precise formalization. There are no discrepancies affecting meaning. Hence the translation passes.

  Natural language: Let X be a metric space and K ⊆ X be compact. For any real ε > 0, there exists a finite subset S of X such that K is contained in the union of open ε-balls centered at points of S. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but this does not affect the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The code formalizes exactly: metric space, compact K, ε > 0, existence of a finite ε-net (interpreted as a finite set S whose ε-balls cover K). This matches the intended theorem.
- The quantification over ε is correctly represented by taking ε as a parameter with hypothesis `0 < ε`; in Lean this is equivalent to a universal quantification.
- The use of open balls is standard and consistent with common definitions of ε-nets.

3) Check for discrepancies:
- The code allows S to be any finite subset of X (S : Finset X), not necessarily a subset of K. Some texts define an ε-net for K to be a subset of K. However, the natural language statement did not specify this, and the docstring explicitly adopts the more permissive interpretation (S ⊆ X). This is a slight generalization but does not misrepresent the claim.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is legitimate and standard in Mathlib terms.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an accurate formalization of the natural language theorem, with only a minor (and acceptable) generalization regarding whether the net lies in K or merely in X.

- The Lean formalization uses f : ℝ → ℝ but takes the limit along the filter 𝓝[S] c, which exactly corresponds to “as x → c along S.” This is a standard and faithful way to express limits of functions defined on S (one can always arbitrarily extend f off S without affecting the limit along S).
- The condition “c is a cluster point of S” is included as `hc : c ∈ closure (S \ {c})`, matching the usual definition.
- The conclusion exactly matches “a f(x) → a L along S as x → c.”
- The original statement also mentions g and its limit M, but g is irrelevant to the constant-multiple rule being asserted. Omitting g is a harmless simplification that does not change the content of the claimed result.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The core claim is: under the assumption that f tends to L along S at c (with c a cluster point of S), then a f tends to a L along S at c. The Lean code states exactly this. The extra function g in the natural language statement is not used in the conclusion and is extraneous. The shift from f : S → ℝ to f : ℝ → ℝ with the within-filter 𝓝[S] c is a standard, faithful reformulation.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement accurately reflects the intended mathematics. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

This is a standard and acceptable specialization of “A is invertible” and matches the intended identity. The use of B as the cofactor matrix is correct.

Additional checks:
- No vacuous or fake definitions: S and B are properly defined using Mathlib constructs; the theorems are stated (with sorry proofs) but that’s acceptable for translation auditing.
- The first part (A S Aᵀ diagonal) is not addressed at all; there is no theorem asserting diagonality or even mentioning A S Aᵀ.

- L : X ≃L[𝕜] Y is a continuous linear equivalence (i.e., a bounded linear operator with a bounded inverse).

- The proof is omitted (by sorry), but we only audit the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let L : X → Y be a linear operator between normed vector spaces, with L invertible and L^{-1} bounded. Then ∃ δ > 0 such that if ‖A - L‖ < δ, then A is invertible and ‖A^{-1}‖ ≤ ‖L^{-1}‖ / (1 - ‖L^{-1}‖ ‖A - L‖), using the Neumann series.
- Lean formalization: Takes L as a continuous linear equivalence (bounded and invertible with bounded inverse), and quantifies over A in the space of continuous linear maps. If A is sufficiently close to L in operator norm, then A is a continuous linear equivalence (i.e., invertible with a bounded inverse), and the norm of A^{-1} is bounded by the same Neumann-series bound: the right-hand side uses ‖L.symm‖ (i.e., ‖L^{-1}‖) and ‖A - L‖.
- The expression matches precisely: E = A with E.symm = A^{-1}, and the inequality is exactly the stated bound.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The code’s assumptions are a standard formalization: L ≃L Y means L and L^{-1} are bounded; this matches the intended assumption (and is needed since ‖A - L‖ requires L to be bounded). The natural language mentions only L^{-1} bounded, but implicitly uses ‖L‖ via ‖A - L‖, so L must be bounded; the Lean assumption is a faithful, slightly more explicit formulation.
- A is taken to be a continuous linear map (bounded), as required for the operator norm to make sense; the NL statement implicitly assumes that too.
- The conclusion that A is invertible with the stated bound on ‖A^{-1}‖ is expressed in Lean by producing a continuous linear equivalence E with E.toContinuousLinearMap = A and the bound on ‖E.symm‖. This is equivalent to A being invertible and satisfying the inequality.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; all symbols are standard Mathlib notions. The presence of sorry for the proof is acceptable per the auditing guidelines.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim, with only standard, benign formalization details.

  - λ_n → 0 and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges.

- The Lean code assumes a stronger hypothesis on x, namely `Summable x` (the series ∑ x_n converges), which implies bounded partial sums but is strictly stronger. The λ-conditions match exactly (tendsto 0 and summable total variation). The conclusion matches: convergence/summability of ∑ λ_n x_n.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- The code proves a specialization of the stated theorem: it requires x to be summable rather than merely having bounded partial sums. This is a significant strengthening of hypotheses; the classical Schlömilch/Dirichlet-type result only needs bounded partial sums of x.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; types and predicates are standard Mathlib constructs. The mismatch is solely in the first hypothesis.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation, but it is a reasonable specialization of the intended result.

Given the guidelines, this merits a high but not perfect score.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_approximate_2229 {p : Polynomial ℂ} (hp : p ≠ 0) (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) (z0 : ℂ) (hpz0 : p.eval z0 ≠ 0) : ∃ w ∈ Metric.ball z0 ε, ‖p.eval w‖ < ‖p.eval z0‖`:
  - Let p be a complex polynomial (p : Polynomial ℂ).
  - Assume hp: p ≠ 0 (so p is not the zero polynomial; it may still be a nonzero constant polynomial).
  - Let ε be a real number with hε: 0 < ε.
  - Let z0 be a complex number.
  - Assume hpz0: p(z0) ≠ 0.
  - Conclusion: There exists w in the open ball centered at z0 of radius ε such that ‖p(w)‖ < ‖p(z0)‖.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: p is either a nonconstant complex polynomial, or more generally a nonconstant power series converging on the open ball around z0 of radius ε, with p(z0) ≠ 0. Then there exists w in that ball with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- Lean code: Restricts to polynomials (which is a specialization; acceptable). However, it assumes only p ≠ 0 instead of p nonconstant. This is a crucial mismatch: a nonzero constant polynomial (e.g., p(z) = c ≠ 0) satisfies p ≠ 0 and p(z0) ≠ 0 but does not satisfy the conclusion (|p(w)| is constant), so the Lean statement claims more than the natural language statement and is in fact false in that case. The natural language requires nonconstant, precisely to exclude this counterexample.
- The convergence condition for power series is moot for polynomials (they converge everywhere), so that part is fine under the specialization.
- The rest (ε > 0, z0 ∈ ℂ, w ∈ ball, strict inequality of norms) matches the intended conclusion.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code weakens the key assumption from “nonconstant” to merely “nonzero.” This includes constant nonzero polynomials, for which the conclusion fails. Therefore, the translation is not faithful. Additionally, the code does not cover the more general case of power series (which would be an acceptable specialization), but the main issue is the incorrect assumption about nonconstancy.

Grade rationale: The code uses legitimate Mathlib notions and mostly matches the structure and quantifiers, but it critically weakens the nonconstancy assumption, making the statement not faithful and in fact incorrect for constant nonzero polynomials. Hence, not a pass; assign a mid-to-high failing score for a substantial but localized discrepancy.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Variables: n : ℕ; U : Set (Fin n → ℝ); f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ. So the domain is ℝ^n modeled as functions Fin n → ℝ.
- grad : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) is an arbitrary function assigning to each x a vector; intended to be ∇f, but not assumed to be.
- Hess : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is an arbitrary function taking x, u, v to a real number; intended to be a bilinear form representing the Hessian, but no bilinearity or relation to f is assumed.

The theorem taylor_second_order_uniform_on_compacts states:
- Assume U is convex: U_convex : Convex ℝ U.
- Assume Hess is continuous on U in x: Hess_cont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fun u v => Hess x u v) U. By topology on function spaces, this means for each fixed u, v, the map x ↦ Hess x u v is continuous on U.
- Then for every compact K ⊆ U, for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, we have the inequality
  | f(x + h) − f x − ∑ i grad x i * h i − (1/2) * Hess x h h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
This is an epsilon-delta version of a uniform little-o(‖h‖^2) remainder on compact subsets.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be differentiable and H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion with remainder o(‖h‖^2) as h → 0, uniformly on compact subsets of U: f(x+h) = f(x) + ∇f(x)·h + 1/2 h^T H_f(x) h + o(‖h‖^2).

Similarities:
- The conclusion in Lean is an ε-δ reformulation of the uniform little-o(‖h‖^2) statement on compact subsets, with an additional condition x + h ∈ U, which is standard when restricting to U.
- U is assumed convex.
- Continuity of the Hessian (as a function of x) is modeled via ContinuosOn of x ↦ (u,v) ↦ Hess x u v, which is equivalent in finite dimensions to continuity of the Hessian entries.
- Domain modeled as Fin n → ℝ is standard for ℝ^n in Mathlib.

Key differences/problems:
- Missing differentiability assumption on f entirely.
- No assumption that grad = ∇f (no link between grad and f).
- No assumption that Hess = H_f (no link between Hess and f), nor any bilinearity/symmetry; Hess is just an arbitrary function in the statement.
- Consequently, the theorem statement asserts a far stronger (and false) property: that for any f and any choices of grad and a continuous-in-x Hess, the Taylor inequality holds uniformly on compacts. This is not faithful to the original statement, where grad and Hess are specifically the gradient and Hessian of f.
- The choice of norm is the Pi/sup norm instead of Euclidean, but in finite dimensions this is acceptable for little-o statements; this is a minor, acceptable technicality.

Step 3: Final check — are the statements the same?
No. The Lean statement omits the crucial hypotheses linking grad and Hess to derivatives of f and does not assume f is differentiable. Therefore, it does not faithfully express the original theorem about f’s second-order Taylor expansion with its true gradient and Hessian. The structural form of the conclusion is correct, but the missing core assumptions make it not faithful.

Grade justification:
- Not vacuous placeholders, but missing essential assumptions (differentiability and identification of grad/Hess with f’s derivatives). The overall shape matches, but the mathematical meaning is substantially different. A low-to-mid score is appropriate.

- variable {f : ℝ → ℝ} {a b ε : ℝ}: f is a real-valued function on ℝ; a, b, ε are real numbers.
- variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop): introduces an arbitrary predicate named RiemannIntegrableOn; it is not tied to Mathlib’s definitions and could denote anything.
- variable (riemannIntegral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ): introduces an arbitrary function symbol for the “Riemann integral” with no connection to Mathlib.

Meaning: Assuming the arbitrary predicate RiemannIntegrableOn holds for f on a,b and ε > 0, there exists a natural n and a function x: Fin (n+1) → ℝ with x 0 = a and x (last) = b, such that for every choice of sample points cs indexed by Fin n, if each cs i lies in the closed interval [x i, x (i+1)], then the absolute difference between the arbitrary “riemannIntegral f a b” and the Riemann sum over that partition is < ε. The proof is omitted (sorry).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Intended statement: For a Riemann-integrable f on [a,b] and ε > 0, there exists a partition a = x₀ ≤ x₁ ≤ … ≤ xₙ = b such that for every choice cₖ ∈ [xₖ₋₁, xₖ], the Riemann sum approximates ∫_a^b f within ε.
- Issues:
  - The code does not enforce that x is a partition (monotonicity/nondecreasing order). It only asserts x 0 = a and x last = b. Without monotonicity, the condition “cs i ∈ [x i, x (i+1)]” may describe empty intervals, making the implication vacuously true for all cs. This significantly weakens the statement and can make the conclusion trivial.
  - The notions of RiemannIntegrableOn and riemannIntegral are not Mathlib’s definitions and are completely uninterpreted placeholders. This detaches the theorem from the actual Riemann integrability and integral on [a,b]. Guideline 2 flags this as a red flag.
  - There is no assumption a ≤ b.
  - The quantification over cs is by an implication (∀ cs, (∀ i, cs i ∈ Icc ...) → ...), which matches the “for every choice of points in the subintervals” structure, but only makes sense if those subintervals are genuine (nonempty), i.e., if x is a true partition. Since monotonicity is missing, the statement can become vacuous.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is strictly weaker than the original and can be vacuously true due to the lack of partition monotonicity.
- It also does not use Mathlib’s proper Riemann integration concepts, instead using arbitrary placeholders.
- Therefore, the code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

Overall: Not faithful. To fix: use Mathlib’s actual Riemann-integrability notion and the integral, and require x to be an increasing (or at least nondecreasing) sequence forming a genuine partition so that each [x i, x (i+1)] is a nonempty interval.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` / `open Filter`: setup and namespaces.
- The theorem statement introduces real numbers `a b c L` with hypotheses `ha : a < c` and `hb : c < b`, which encode that `c ∈ (a,b)`.
- `f : ℝ → ℝ` together with `hf : ContinuousOn f { x | a < x ∧ x < b }` formalizes that `f` is continuous on the open interval `(a,b)`.
- `hd : DifferentiableOn ℝ f ({ x | a < x ∧ x < b } \ {c})` formalizes that `f` is differentiable on `(a,b) \ {c}`.
- `hL : Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) (nhdsWithin c ({ x | a < x ∧ x < b } \ {c})) (nhds L)` states that the derivative `f'` tends to `L` as `x → c` within the punctured interval. Since `hd` ensures differentiability on that set, `deriv f x` coincides with the classical derivative there.
- The conclusion `HasDerivAt f L c` asserts that `f` is differentiable at `c` with derivative `L` (i.e., `f'(c) = L`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: `f : (a,b) → ℝ` is continuous on `(a,b)`, differentiable on `(a,b) \ {c}`, and `lim_{x→c} f'(x) = L` exists; conclude `f` is differentiable at `c` with `f'(c)=L`.
- Lean models the domain as `ℝ` with properties restricted to the set `(a,b)`. This is a standard and faithful formalization of functions defined on an interval.
- The limit of `f'` is taken with respect to `nhdsWithin c ((a,b) \ {c})`, matching the intended “approach `c` within the interval, excluding `c`”.
- The conclusion `HasDerivAt f L c` exactly captures “`f` is differentiable at `c` and `f'(c)=L`”.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are standard Mathlib concepts.
- No extra unintended assumptions beyond `c ∈ (a,b)` and the given regularity.
- The only modeling difference is treating `f` as `ℝ → ℝ` with `ContinuousOn`/`DifferentiableOn` on the interval, which is equivalent to the natural-language domain `(a,b)`.
- Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem assumes a kernel k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ and a hypothesis hk that k is ContinuousOn the rectangle [0,1] × [0,1] (Icc 0 1 ×ˢ Icc 0 1).
- It claims the existence of a function L : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ such that:
  • For every f, if f is continuous on [0,1], then y ↦ L f y is continuous on [0,1].
  • For every f and y with y ∈ [0,1], L f y = ∫ (over ℝ with respect to Lebesgue measure) of x ↦ k (x, y) * f x.
  • For all scalars a and functions f, g that are continuous on [0,1], one has L (x ↦ a * f x + g x) = (y ↦ a * L f y + L g y). This asserts linearity on the subset of functions continuous on [0,1].

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original statement defines L on C([0,1], ℝ) by Lf(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x, y) f(x) dx, maps into C([0,1], ℝ), and asks to prove well-definedness (Lf is continuous) and linearity.
- The code differs crucially in the definition of the integral: it uses MeasureTheory.integral volume (the Lebesgue integral over all of ℝ) of x ↦ k(x, y) * f x, rather than the integral over x ∈ [0,1]. There is no restriction to the interval [0,1] via indicator or a restricted measure, nor the interval integral ∫ x in 0..1. This is a substantial mismatch: the operator in the code is ∫_ℝ, not ∫_0^1.
- Domain/codomain: The code presents L as a function on all ℝ → ℝ, with properties stated only for f continuous on [0,1], and continuity of Lf only on [0,1]. While using ℝ → ℝ with ContinuousOn hypotheses can be an acceptable formalization of C([0,1], ℝ), the core mismatch remains the integration domain.
- The code asserts existence of some L with the stated properties rather than defining L explicitly. This can be acceptable if the characterizing equation specifies L correctly on [0,1], but here it specifies the wrong integral (over ℝ), so it does not uniquely characterize the intended operator on [0,1].
- Further, integrating over ℝ with the integrand k(x,y) f(x) requires behavior of k and f outside [0,1]; the statement only concerns k’s continuity on [0,1]^2 and f on [0,1]. The natural operator only uses x ∈ [0,1]. The code’s version may not even be well-behaved, and in Mathlib the integral of a non-integrable function returns 0 by convention, which is not intended here.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The major discrepancy is the integration domain: the code integrates over ℝ instead of over [0,1]. This changes the operator L fundamentally and breaks faithfulness to the original definition. Other differences (treating functions as ℝ → ℝ and using ContinuousOn, existential L, behavior outside y ∈ [0,1]) are acceptable formalization choices, but the integration-domain error is not.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the incorrect integration domain and associated semantic issues.

- Domain/assumptions: The Lean code uses a commutative ring, which is the standard context for determinants. The natural language statement did not specify the coefficient ring/field; using a commutative ring is a faithful and slightly more general or standard setting.
- Technical conditions (Fintype n, DecidableEq n) are routine formalization requirements. They do not change the mathematical meaning.

The δ that is introduced is never used to restrict x. This makes the statement dramatically stronger (in fact, unrealistically strong), and not equivalent to the intended local statement. The original requires the inequality only for x within δ of c (and within I).
- The “equivalently” formulation with a function g and limit 0 is not formalized at all. The docstring mentions it informally, but the theorem statement does not include this equivalence.

Step 3: Final check: Are they the same?
No. The formal theorem demands the inequality to hold for all x ∈ ℝ (no proximity condition), which is much stronger than, and not equivalent to, the intended local estimate near c. The δ quantifier is present but unused, making the formalized conclusion incorrect relative to the natural language statement. The equivalence with the g formulation is also omitted.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- import Mathlib: brings in Mathlib.
- def RiemannIntegrable (f : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := True: introduces a placeholder predicate for Riemann integrability; it is vacuous (always true).
- def L1 (f : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := True: introduces a placeholder predicate for L1 integrability (finite integral of |f|); also vacuous.
- open Function Set: namespace openings, irrelevant to content.
- The docstring states the natural language goal: given f Riemann integrable and L1, g continuous and zero outside [a,b], show the convolution integral is well-defined for all x.
- theorem convolution_well_defined {a b : ℝ} (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : RiemannIntegrable f) (hf_l1 : L1 f) (hg_cont : Continuous g) (hg_zero : ∀ t, t < a ∨ t > b → g t = 0) (x : ℝ) : RiemannIntegrable (fun t => f t * g (x - t)) := by sorry
  Meaning: For any real a, b, functions f, g, if f is RiemannIntegrable (placeholder), f is L1 (placeholder), g is continuous, and g vanishes outside [a,b], then for any x, the function t ↦ f(t) g(x − t) is RiemannIntegrable (placeholder). The proof is omitted with sorry.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The intended mathematical content aligns: the goal is to show the convolution integral ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt exists (is well-defined) for all x. One way to formalize this is to assert integrability of the integrand t ↦ f(t) g(x − t) for each x, which the theorem statement does.
- However, the predicates RiemannIntegrable and L1 are defined as True, so they do not carry the actual mathematical meaning. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and not vacuous.
- The theorem uses sorry (unproven), which is permissible for translation auditing, but combined with vacuous predicates means the statement is effectively trivial and does not faithfully encode the real conditions.
- The property “g equal to zero outside [a,b]” is represented as ∀ t, (t < a ∨ t > b) → g t = 0, which correctly matches the natural language.
- The code does not define the convolution function (g * f); instead it asserts integrability of the kernel for each x. This is an acceptable reformulation for “well-definedness,” provided the integrability predicate were real.
- The code does not use Mathlib’s actual notions (e.g., Integrable with respect to measure, compact support, or Riemann improper integrals), which is a red flag per the guidelines.

3) Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? Mathematically, the high-level intent of the theorem statement aligns with the natural language claim (existence of the convolution integral for all x), but the translation fails due to vacuous auxiliary definitions (RiemannIntegrable := True, L1 := True). Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Given the vacuous definitions, the code does not genuinely encode the assumptions nor the conclusion, even though the overall shape of the theorem matches the original statement. If the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib predicates and the statement adjusted to a legitimate integrability notion, it would be faithful. As is, it fails the criteria.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open MeasureTheory Set`: we work in Mathlib with measure theory and set-theoretic notions.
- Variables: `n : ℕ`, `R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)`, `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`. So the ambient space is ℝ^n modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`.
- The theorem `exists_measurable_null_set_of_zero` assumes:
  • `hR : IsClosed R`: R is a closed subset of ℝ^n.
  • `hf_int : MeasureTheory.IntegrableOn f R volume`: f is Lebesgue integrable on R (with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure `volume`).
  • `hf_nonneg : ∀ x ∈ R, 0 ≤ f x`: f is nonnegative on R.
  • `h : ∫ x in R, f x ∂volume = 0`: the (Lebesgue) integral of f over R is zero.
  Conclusion: there exists a set `E` with `E ⊆ R`, `MeasurableSet E`, `volume E = 0`, and `∀ x ∈ R \ E, f x = 0`. That is, f = 0 on R outside a measurable null set.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n; f: R → ℝ is Riemann integrable with f ≥ 0 on R; if the Riemann integral over R is 0, then there exists E ⊆ R of outer measure 0 such that f = 0 on R \ E.
- Code differences:
  • Domain/Integrability: The code uses Lebesgue integrability on the set R (IntegrableOn) and the Lebesgue integral over R, rather than Riemann integrability on a rectangle. This is a standard generalization; any Riemann integrable function on a rectangle is Lebesgue integrable and the integrals coincide. So the code’s assumptions are slightly different but imply the original case.
  • Shape of R: The code assumes R is a closed set, not specifically a closed rectangle. This is a generalization (the conclusion still holds and includes the rectangle case).
  • Exceptional set: The code produces a measurable set E with `volume E = 0`. The natural language asks for “outer measure zero.” In Lebesgue theory, a set of outer measure zero is measurable and has measure zero, so the code’s conclusion is slightly stronger and thus acceptable.
  • Function domain: The code takes f defined on the whole space and integrates on R; the statement has f: R → ℝ. This is a routine formalization choice and does not change the meaning.

3) Final comparison:
- The theorem stated in Lean is a standard measure-theoretic strengthening of the natural language statement. It implies the original claim when specialized to R a closed rectangle and f Riemann integrable. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are from Mathlib. The only differences are benign generalizations (Lebesgue vs Riemann, closed set vs rectangle, measurable null set vs outer null set) that preserve and strengthen the content.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful in mathematical meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- variable {n : ℕ}: We fix a natural number n, working on ℝ^n modeled as (Fin n → ℝ).
- The theorem mean_value_inequality states: For a function f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ, a set U ⊆ (Fin n → ℝ), a real M, and points x, y ∈ (Fin n → ℝ), if
  • U is convex,
  • x ∈ U and y ∈ U,
  • f is differentiable on U (DifferentiableOn ℝ f U),
  • and the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative is bounded on U by M, i.e., ∀ z ∈ U, ‖fderiv ℝ f z‖ ≤ M,
  then the inequality holds: |f y - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x)| ≤ M * ‖y - x‖.
Here fderiv ℝ f x is the (ambient) Fréchet derivative at x as a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ, and ‖·‖ is its operator norm.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Domain/codomain: f : ℝ^n → ℝ. In Lean, ℝ^n is represented as (Fin n → ℝ); codomain ℝ. Matches.
- Set U is convex. Matches.
- Assumptions on f: The natural statement says “has continuous partial derivatives on U,” which implies differentiability (indeed C^1). The Lean code assumes DifferentiableOn ℝ f U, which is weaker than having continuous partials, but still reasonable as a generalization for stating the inequality. No extra placeholder or vacuous definitions are used.
- Bound on the gradient: The natural statement bounds the Euclidean norm of ∇f(z) by M for all z ∈ U. In Lean, this is encoded as a bound on the operator norm of fderiv ℝ f z by M, which is the standard formalization of the same notion (for ℝ^n → ℝ, the operator norm of the derivative equals the Euclidean norm of the gradient in the canonical identification). Matches in meaning.
- Conclusion: The inequality |f(y) − f(x) − ∇f(x) · (y − x)| ≤ M‖y − x‖ is rendered as |f y − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) (y − x)| ≤ M * ‖y − x‖. This is exactly the same form, with fderiv playing the role of the gradient as a linear functional.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- The natural statement assumes “continuous partial derivatives,” while the code only assumes DifferentiableOn. This is a slight generalization (weaker hypothesis) and is acceptable.
- Subtlety: DifferentiableOn in mathlib means differentiable within U at each point, not necessarily differentiable in the ambient sense at each x ∈ U. The statement nevertheless uses fderiv ℝ f x (the ambient derivative) rather than fderivWithin ℝ f U x. In mathlib, fderiv is still a total function (defaults to 0 if not differentiable), but mathematically, the natural statement presumes the ambient derivative (gradient) exists due to the “continuous partial derivatives” assumption. So the Lean statement is slightly weaker on the differentiability hypothesis than what the natural statement guarantees and uses ambient derivative in the conclusion. This is a minor mismatch but does not amount to a vacuous or incorrect translation of the intended claim; it reads as a generalization of the hypothesis side.
- No fake or placeholder definitions are present; all terms are standard mathlib notions.

Overall: The Lean statement faithfully captures the intended inequality, with standard formal replacements (Fréchet derivative/operator norm for gradient). The only notable difference is weakening “continuous partial derivatives” to “differentiable on U” and the within-vs-ambient derivative subtlety, which is a minor formal mismatch. The translation is essentially faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The environment sets up a very general setting: 𝕜 is a nontrivially normed field, E and F are normed vector spaces over 𝕜 (NormedAddCommGroup and NormedSpace), so this encompasses the usual case E = ℝ^n and F = ℝ.
- f : E → F, x₀ : E, Df : E →L[𝕜] F (a continuous linear map, i.e., the Fréchet derivative).
- HasFDerivAt f Df x₀ is the standard Mathlib predicate meaning f is Fréchet differentiable at x₀ with derivative Df.
- The theorem statement: If HasFDerivAt f Df x₀, then for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all h with ‖h‖ < δ, we have ‖f (x₀ + h) - f x₀ - Df h‖ ≤ (‖Df‖ + ε) * ‖h‖.

2) Does this capture the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is: if f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable at x₀, then |f(x₀ + h) - f(x₀) - Df(x₀)h| ≤ ‖Df(x₀)‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖) as h → 0.
- The Lean theorem is the standard ε–δ reformulation of “≤ ‖Df‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖)”: for every ε > 0, eventually the remainder is bounded by (‖Df‖ + ε)‖h‖, which is equivalent to saying the remainder is ≤ ‖Df‖‖h‖ plus a term that is o(‖h‖). It also uses the operator norm ‖Df‖, matching the statement.
- The code generalizes from ℝ^n → ℝ to general normed spaces E → F over any nontrivially normed field 𝕜. This is a standard and acceptable generalization that still implies the specific case in the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (HasFDerivAt, continuous linear map, operator norm) are standard Mathlib.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Content: Same, up to generalization and the equivalent ε–δ phrasing of the little-o remainder. The Lean statement faithfully captures the mathematical meaning of the natural language statement.
- No discrepancies that change meaning. The generalization to E, F, 𝕜 is acceptable per the guidelines.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

  The theorem claims equality of the two definitions for every S, with the proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines m*(S) using countable (ℕ-indexed) covers by open rectangles and V(R_j), and μ*(S) using covers indexed by a finite or countably infinite set I. The code exactly mirrors this: mstar uses ℕ-indexed covers; mustar uses covers indexed by any countable type I (which includes finite and countably infinite index sets). The predicate is_open_rectangle stands in for “open rectangles”, and V for the volume function, which is appropriate and faithful.
- The domain ℝ^n is represented as Fin n → ℝ, which is standard in Lean and faithful to ℝ^n.
- Using ENNReal for volumes is consistent with allowing infinite sums and is the standard choice in Mathlib; it preserves the intended meaning.
- The final theorem asserts μ*(S) = m*(S) for all S, exactly the claim in the natural language statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code is a slight generalization because it abstracts the notion of “open rectangle” and the volume function V, but the equality stated is purely about indexing (ℕ vs any countable index set), which remains true in this generality. This does not distort the statement and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous placeholders: both mstar and mustar are genuine definitions; no dummy equalities or trivial predicates are used.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens are standard Mathlib tools for measure theory and filters.
- The theorem `jirilebl_ra_ch_riemann_3485` is stated for a function `f : ℝ → ℝ`.
- Assumption `h_int : ∀ M : ℝ, IntervalIntegrable f volume (0 : ℝ) M` means: for every real M, f is (Lebesgue) interval integrable on the interval from 0 to M. In Mathlib, `IntervalIntegrable` is the standard (Lebesgue/Bochner) integrability on segments, which subsumes Riemann integrability; it ensures the interval integral ∫_0^M f exists.
- Assumption `h_abs : (∫⁻ x in Ioi (0 : ℝ), ‖f x‖₊) < ⊤` means: the integral of |f| over (0, ∞) is finite (the nonnegative integral `∫⁻` taking values in `ℝ≥0∞`). This corresponds to ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞. The use of (0, ∞) instead of [0, ∞) is a negligible measure-zero difference at 0.
- The left-hand side of the equivalence `(∃ L : ℝ, Tendsto (fun R => (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..R, f x)) atTop (nhds L))` means: the improper integral ∫_0^∞ f exists, i.e., the net of partial integrals ∫_0^R f converges to some real L as R → ∞ (R in ℝ with the atTop filter).
- The right-hand side `(∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ R : ℝ, R ≥ M → |(∫ x in M..R, f x)| < ε)` says: for every ε > 0 there is M such that for all R ≥ M, the tail integral ∫_M^R f has absolute value < ε. This is exactly the stated tail Cauchy-type condition.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: f : [0, ∞) → ℝ is Riemann integrable on each [0, M] and ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞. Show that ∫_0^∞ f exists iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, |∫_M^R f| < ε.
- The Lean statement uses f : ℝ → ℝ and requires interval integrability on [0, M] for every real M (a slight generalization, since the function is defined on all ℝ and the hypothesis is stronger by not restricting M ≥ 0). This is acceptable and faithful in spirit.
- The Lean integrability notion is Lebesgue interval integrability instead of Riemann. In Mathlib, this is the standard way to formalize such statements; it generalizes the Riemann condition and is acceptable as a faithful formalization.
- The absolute integrability hypothesis is formulated via the nonnegative/Lebesgue integral over Ioi(0), which matches ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞.
- The conclusion and the tail criterion are stated exactly as in the natural language, in terms of the limit of ∫_0^R f as R → ∞ and the bound on |∫_M^R f| for R ≥ M.

Final check for differences:
- Domain: natural statement has f on [0, ∞); Lean has f on ℝ. This is a benign generalization (stronger assumptions), not a mismatch.
- Integrability notion: Riemann vs Lebesgue interval integrable. This is a standard, faithful generalization; no placeholder or vacuous definitions are used.
- Set Ioi(0) vs [0, ∞): negligible measure-zero difference at 0, covered by interval integrability near 0.
- Quantification over M: Lean allows any real M; natural language implicitly has M ≥ 0. Since the existence quantifier allows choosing M ≥ 0 and the statement is only strengthened, this is acceptable.
- All definitions used are genuine Mathlib notions; there are no fake or vacuous definitions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization (with slight, standard generalizations) of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: We are working within Mathlib, so using standard library definitions for bounded continuous functions and metrics.
- variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]: We fix a type X with a topology. This is sufficient to talk about continuity of functions X → ℝ.
- open BoundedContinuousFunction: We will use the notation X →ᵇ ℝ for the type of bounded continuous functions X → ℝ.

- instance metricSpace_Cb : MetricSpace (X →ᵇ ℝ) := by sorry
  Natural language: We assert that the space of bounded continuous real-valued functions on X carries a metric structure. The intended metric (by the comment) is the sup metric (coming from the standard dist on BoundedContinuousFunction, i.e., d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x) − g(x)|). The proof is omitted, but this is the standard structure in Mathlib.

- theorem convergence_iff_uniform (f : X →ᵇ ℝ) (s : ℕ → X →ᵇ ℝ) :
    (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, dist (s n) f < ε) ↔
      (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : X, |(s n : X → ℝ) x - (f : X → ℝ) x| < ε) := by sorry
  Natural language: For a sequence (s n) of bounded continuous functions converging to f in the sup metric, convergence in the metric (dist (s n) f → 0) is equivalent to uniform convergence: for every ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ X, |s n x − f x| < ε. This is stated for sequences (ε–N formulation). The proof is omitted, but this states exactly that convergence in the sup metric is the same as uniform convergence.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: Let (X, d) be a metric space. Let C_b(X, ℝ) be the set of bounded continuous functions X → ℝ with metric d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x) − g(x)|. Show (C_b(X, ℝ), d) is a metric space and that convergence in d is equivalent to uniform convergence.
- The Lean code uses BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ to represent C_b(X, ℝ), and asserts an instance of MetricSpace on it, corresponding (as per the comment) to the sup metric. It then states the equivalence between convergence in this metric and uniform convergence (for sequences). This matches the mathematical content.

Potential differences and their assessment:
- The code assumes only [TopologicalSpace X], not that X is a metric space. This is a benign generalization: the sup metric on bounded continuous functions does not require a metric on X, only a topology to define continuity. This is acceptable and faithful or even slightly stronger.
- The equivalence is stated for sequences (ε–N). In metric spaces, convergence is characterizable by sequences, so this is a standard and faithful way to express the equivalence.
- The code does not explicitly define d(f,g) as the sup; instead it relies on the standard dist on BoundedContinuousFunction and states the metric space instance and the convergence equivalence matching that dist. The comment explicitly points to the sup metric, and the second theorem’s right-hand side characterizes exactly the sup metric. This is faithful in intent and content.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced: there are no placeholders like := True or := none; the uses of `sorry` are for proofs/instances, which are allowed per the instructions.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same in mathematical meaning: the code formalizes that C_b(X, ℝ) with the sup metric is a metric space and that convergence in this metric is equivalent to uniform convergence. The only deviations are benign generalization (X just topological) and focusing on sequences, which is standard in metric contexts.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Matrix Equiv: Set up the environment with Mathlib, and open the Matrix and Equiv namespaces.
- variable {R : Type _} {n : Type _} [CommRing R] [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]: We work over a commutative ring R, with square matrices indexed by a finite type n with decidable equality.

- theorem det_swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix.det ((Matrix.reindex (Equiv.refl n) (Equiv.swap j k)).toFun A) = - Matrix.det A := by sorry
  Natural language: For any square matrix A and indices j, k, if we permute the columns of A by the transposition that swaps j and k (implemented as reindexing columns by Equiv.swap j k and rows by identity), then the determinant of the resulting matrix equals minus the determinant of A. Notably, there is no hypothesis that j ≠ k.

- theorem det_swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix.det ((Matrix.reindex (Equiv.swap j k) (Equiv.refl n)).toFun A) = - Matrix.det A := by sorry
  Natural language: Similarly, permuting the rows of A by the transposition swapping j and k (reindexing rows by swap and columns by identity) yields a matrix whose determinant is the negative of det A. Again, no j ≠ k assumption.

- theorem det_eq_zero_if_equal_rows (A : Matrix n n R) {i j : n} (h : i ≠ j) (heq : ∀ k, A i k = A j k) : Matrix.det A = 0 := by sorry
  Natural language: If two distinct rows i ≠ j of A are equal entrywise (for all columns k), then det A = 0. This exactly matches the standard statement.

- theorem det_eq_zero_if_equal_cols (A : Matrix n n R) {i j : n} (h : i ≠ j) (heq : ∀ k, A k i = A k j) : Matrix.det A = 0 := by sorry
  Natural language: If two distinct columns i ≠ j of A are equal entrywise (for all rows k), then det A = 0. This also matches the standard statement.

2) Comparison to the original natural language statement:
- The English statement: swapping columns j and k (respectively rows j and k) flips the sign of the determinant. Typically, “switching column j and k” presumes j ≠ k (interchanging two distinct columns). If j = k, the operation is the identity and the determinant should remain the same, not change sign.
- The Lean code’s first two theorems assert det(...swap j k...) = - det A for all j, k without assuming j ≠ k. When j = k, the swap is the identity permutation, so the left-hand side equals det A, while the right-hand side equals -det A; this is false unless det A = 0. Thus the Lean statements overclaim compared to the intended mathematical statement.
- The last two theorems (equal rows/columns imply det = 0) faithfully capture the intended content with the necessary distinctness assumption i ≠ j and pointwise equality of the rows/columns.
- The code is slightly more general in that it works over any commutative ring R and arbitrary finite index type n; this generalization is harmless and faithful to the math.
- There are no fake or vacuous auxiliary definitions; only theorem statements with sorry proofs, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- For the sign-change under swapping, the Lean code misses the crucial hypothesis j ≠ k and thus states an incorrect conclusion in the j = k case. The natural-language statement implicitly assumes distinct indices, so the Lean translation is not faithful for these parts.
- For the zero determinant with equal rows/columns, the Lean code is faithful.

Conclusion: Mostly faithful, but with a significant omission (j ≠ k) in the swap theorems that changes the meaning. Hence not fully faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code imports Mathlib and opens the Filter and Topology namespaces (standard setup for filters and limits).

- First theorem `liminf_le_liminf_of_le_of_tendsto`:
  - Context: `x y : ℕ → ℝ` are real sequences.
  - Hypothesis `h : ∀ n, x n ≤ y n`: pointwise inequality x_n ≤ y_n for all n.
  - A real number `l : ℝ` is fixed along with `hx : Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 l)`: the sequence x converges to l as n → ∞ (filter `atTop` on ℕ).
  - Conclusion: `Filter.liminf x atTop ≤ Filter.liminf y atTop`: the liminf of x is ≤ the liminf of y.
  - This directly formalizes “Suppose (x_n) converges and x_n ≤ y_n for all n. Then liminf x ≤ liminf y.” The inclusion of the explicit limit `l` just encodes convergence and is harmless.

- Second theorem `limsup_le_limsup_of_le_of_tendsto`:
  - Same hypotheses as above: pointwise inequality and convergence of x to some l.
  - Conclusion: `Filter.limsup x atTop ≤ Filter.limsup y atTop`: the limsup of x is ≤ the limsup of y.
  - This directly formalizes the limsup part of the natural language statement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose {x_n} converges and x_n ≤ y_n for all n. Show that liminf x ≤ liminf y and limsup x ≤ limsup y.”
- The Lean code states exactly these two inequalities under the same assumptions (convergence of x and pointwise ≤), using `atTop` to represent n → ∞ and `Filter.liminf/limsup` for liminf/limsup.
- Splitting into two theorems is fine; both assertions are covered.
- Domain is ℝ, which matches the standard interpretation of sequences in analysis; the original didn’t specify a more general type, so this is acceptable.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions. Proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing as per the instructions.

Final check for differences:
- Extra explicit parameter `l : ℝ` is just the limit of x and faithfully encodes “x_n converges.”
- Indexing by ℕ and using `atTop` matches n → ∞.
- No additional unintended assumptions on y.
- Therefore, the Lean statements are faithful translations of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

  asserts: For a real inner product space E (with the usual normed additive group structure and assumed complete), and a function f : E → ℝ differentiable at x₀, the norm of the gradient at x₀ equals the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative at x₀. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions, since we only check translation of the statement.
  The `{n : ℕ}` parameter is unused. The space E is not fixed to ℝ^n; instead, the statement is for any real inner product space E.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is for E = ℝ^n with its usual inner product, and claims ‖∇ f(x₀)‖ equals the supremum of |Df(x₀)h| over unit vectors h, i.e., the operator norm of Df(x₀). The Lean statement asserts ‖∇ f x₀‖ = ‖fderiv ℝ f x₀‖, where ‖fderiv‖ is the operator norm. In Mathlib, the operator norm is by definition the supremum of ‖L h‖ over ‖h‖ ≤ 1 (equivalently over ‖h‖ = 1 when L ≠ 0), and since the codomain is ℝ, ‖L h‖ = |L h|. Thus the Lean formulation is exactly the “That is” restatement in the problem.
- The Lean code generalizes from ℝ^n to any real inner product space E (with a possibly superfluous completeness assumption). This is a benign generalization and faithful to the mathematical content.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The mathematical claim is the same (up to a standard and acceptable generalization from ℝ^n to a real inner product space E). The RHS uses operator norm in Lean, which equals the supremum expression in the natural language statement. No vacuous definitions are introduced. The unused parameter `n` and the extra `[CompleteSpace E]` do not change the meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The file imports Mathlib and opens Filter, Topology, MeasureTheory namespaces. It will work with measure-theoretic (Lebesgue) integrals and topology.

- Theorem riemann_integrable_on_of_limits:
  Hypotheses:
  • a, b : ℝ with a < b.
  • Sequences a_n, b_n : ℕ → ℝ.
  • For all n, a < a_n n < b_n n < b.
  • a_n → a and b_n → b (usual topological limits).
  • For all n, f is interval-integrable with respect to volume (Lebesgue measure) on [a_n n, b_n n], expressed as IntervalIntegrable f volume (a_n n) (b_n n).
  Conclusion:
  • f is interval-integrable (Lebesgue) on [a, b], i.e., IntervalIntegrable f volume a b.

- Theorem integral_of_limits:
  With the same hypotheses as above, concludes
  • Tendsto (fun n => ∫ x in a_n n..b_n n, f x) atTop (𝓝 (∫ x in a..b, f x)).
  That is, the Lebesgue interval integrals over [a_n, b_n] converge to the Lebesgue interval integral over [a, b].

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Original statement:
- f : [a,b] → ℝ is bounded.
- a_n, b_n are sequences with a < a_n < b_n < b, a_n → a, b_n → b.
- f is Riemann integrable on each [a_n, b_n].
- Conclusion: f is Riemann integrable on [a,b] and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_{a_n}^{b_n} f (Riemann integrals).

Discrepancies:
- The Lean code uses IntervalIntegrable and the interval integral ∫ x in a..b, f x, both measure-theoretic (Lebesgue) notions, not Riemann integrability. There is no mention or use of Riemann integrability in the hypotheses or conclusions.
- The hypothesis of f being bounded is missing in the Lean statements.
- The conclusion in the first theorem is Lebesgue integrability on [a,b], not Riemann integrability.
- The limit statement is about Lebesgue interval integrals, not Riemann integrals.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- While structurally similar (integrability on inner intervals implies integrability on the full interval; convergence of integrals), the notions differ: Riemann vs Lebesgue. The boundedness assumption, crucial for connecting Riemann and Lebesgue integrals, is omitted entirely. Therefore, the code does not faithfully formalize the original Riemann-integral statement. It instead states a measure-theoretic variant with weaker hypotheses in one place (no boundedness) and a different integrability concept throughout.

Additional notes:
- There are no vacuous placeholder definitions; the code uses legitimate Mathlib concepts. Proofs are left as sorry, which is acceptable here since we only judge the statement translation. However, the docstring claims Riemann integrable, which conflicts with the actual code using IntervalIntegrable and Lebesgue integrals.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the change from Riemann to Lebesgue integrability and omission of boundedness, so the mathematical meaning differs in an essential way.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but the code does not use established Riemann integration notions from Mathlib.
- variable {n : Nat}: We work in R^n.
- open Set: We use set-theoretic notation.
- def is_rectangle (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := ∃ a b : Fin n → ℝ, R = { x | ∀ i, a i ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ b i }:
  This defines “rectangle” as a closed axis-aligned box [a, b] in ℝ^n. This is a reasonable formalization of (closed) rectangles for Riemann integration.
- def has_zero_volume (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True:
  This is a placeholder predicate for “R has zero volume,” but it is defined as True for all sets, hence vacuous and not faithful.
- theorem integral_on_union_of_zero_intersection ...:
  Hypotheses:
  • hR, hR', hR'': R, R', R'' are rectangles (in the closed box sense).
  • h_union: R = R' ∪ R''.
  • h_inter: R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle.
  • h_zero: has_zero_volume (R' ∩ R'') (but has_zero_volume is True, so this hypothesis imposes no real constraint).
  • f: a function from ℝ^n to ℝ (modeled as (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ).
  • RiemannIntegrableOn: an arbitrary predicate ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop passed in as a parameter, intended to stand for “Riemann integrable on a set.”
  • RiemannIntegral: an arbitrary function ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ, intended to stand for the Riemann integral over a set.
  • h_intR', h_intR'': Assume f is integrable (with respect to the arbitrary predicate) on R' and R''.
  Conclusion:
  • f is integrable on R (again, with respect to the arbitrary predicate) and the integral over R equals the sum of the integrals over R' and R'' (with respect to the arbitrary integral function).
  The proof is omitted (by sorry).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: R', R'' are rectangles, R = R' ∪ R'' is a rectangle, R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle with one side length 0 (so volume 0). If f is Riemann integrable on R' and R'', then f is Riemann integrable on R, and ∫_R f = ∫_{R'} f + ∫_{R''} f.
- Issues:
  • has_zero_volume is a vacuous placeholder (always True), so it does not capture “R' ∩ R'' has zero volume” or “one side length 0.” This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and not vacuous.
  • The theorem is parametrized by arbitrary symbols RiemannIntegrableOn and RiemannIntegral, with no properties assumed. This is not faithful to the specific concept of “Riemann integrable” and the “Riemann integral” in Mathlib or in the natural statement. It effectively claims the result for any arbitrary predicate/function, which is not the intended meaning.
  • is_rectangle is a reasonable model of closed axis-aligned rectangles; that part is fine.
- Therefore, the core mathematical content (Riemann integrability, integral additivity, zero-volume intersection) is not properly captured: the zero-volume condition is vacuous, and the integral/integrability notions are abstract placeholders rather than the Riemann ones.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Different. The Lean statement uses a vacuous zero-volume predicate and quantifies over arbitrary integrability/integral notions, whereas the natural statement refers specifically to Riemann integrability and integral with a meaningful zero-volume (one side length zero) hypothesis. Even if the structure superficially mirrors the natural statement, the placeholders make the formal statement not faithful.

Grade justification:
- Contains a vacuous auxiliary definition (has_zero_volume := True) and abstracts away the integral/integrability notions into arbitrary parameters. If those were replaced by legitimate Mathlib notions (e.g., proper measure/volume-zero or Riemann content) and real Riemann integrability/integral, the theorem statement would be close to faithful. Hence, per rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” warranting around a 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `constant Partition : Type` introduces an uninterpreted type of partitions. It carries no structure and is not connected to an interval [a,b].
- `constant RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop` introduces an uninterpreted predicate saying a function is Riemann integrable on [a,b], with no definition.
- `constant integral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ` introduces an uninterpreted function giving the integral value of f on [a,b].
- `constant upper_sum : (ℝ → ℝ) → Partition → ℝ` and `constant lower_sum : (ℝ → ℝ) → Partition → ℝ` introduce uninterpreted notions of upper and lower sums given f and a partition, but they are not linked to [a,b].
- The theorem `riemann_integrable_of_partition_sums_tend_to_zero` states: given a boundedness hypothesis `hf_bdd : ∃ M, ∀ x, |f x| ≤ M` (bounded on all of ℝ, stronger than just on [a,b]), a sequence of partitions `P : ℕ → Partition`, and a convergence assumption `h_diff` that `|upper_sum f (P k) - lower_sum f (P k)| → 0`, then there exists `L0` such that `RiemannIntegrableOn f a b` holds, `integral f a b = L0`, and both `upper_sum f (P k)` and `lower_sum f (P k)` converge to `L0` (the last two encoded by ∀ ε > 0 ... Cauchy/limit conditions). The proof is omitted via `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The mathematical content intended matches the natural statement: from the existence of a sequence of partitions with vanishing upper-lower sum gap, conclude Riemann integrability and equality of the integral to both limits of upper and lower sums.
- However, the formalization uses wholly uninterpreted placeholders for all key notions (Partition, RiemannIntegrableOn, integral, upper_sum, lower_sum). There is no link between the partitions and the interval [a,b]. This breaks faithfulness: the code does not genuinely express the real definitions in Mathlib or even meaningful ones.
- The boundedness hypothesis is stronger than required (bounded on all ℝ instead of just on [a,b]). This is a small mismatch but could be acceptable as a slight strengthening if the rest were faithful.

3) Final comparison:
- Key differences:
  - Vacuous/placeholder definitions for core concepts instead of Mathlib's actual notions. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and faithful, not placeholders.
  - No connection between `Partition` and the interval [a,b]; upper/lower sums do not depend on [a,b].
  - Slightly stronger boundedness assumption.
- Because of the vacuous placeholders, the translation is not faithful under the guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib definitions tying partitions and sums to [a,b], the theorem statement structure would then match the natural language statement (up to the stronger boundedness assumption), so this sits at the ""makes up vacuous definitions but would otherwise be faithful"" level.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library; fine.
- `universe u`: Universe declaration; irrelevant to the math content.
- Theorem signature: `theorem compact_is_closed {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [T2Space X] {s : Set X} (hs : IsCompact s) : IsClosed s`.
  - This reads: For any type X equipped with a topology (`[TopologicalSpace X]`) and satisfying the T2 (Hausdorff) separation axiom (`[T2Space X]`), and for any subset `s : Set X`, if `s` is compact (`IsCompact s`), then `s` is closed (`IsClosed s`).
  - The comment above the theorem explicitly states the intended content: In a Hausdorff (T2) space, every compact set is closed.

Assessment of fidelity:
- The natural language statement is: ""In any Hausdorff space, every compact set is closed.""
- The Lean code formalizes exactly this: the assumptions are that X is a Hausdorff space (via `T2Space X`), `s` is a subset of X, `s` is compact, and the conclusion is that `s` is closed.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of `T2Space` is the standard Mathlib encoding of Hausdorff. `IsCompact` and `IsClosed` are the standard Mathlib predicates for compactness and closedness of subsets.
- There is a `sorry` for the proof, but per the instructions we only check the statement's faithfulness, not the proof. The presence of `sorry` does not change the statement and is allowed in a compiling Lean file.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. No generalization or restriction beyond the intended meaning. No discrepancies found.

  Natural language: For any types X and Y with topological space structures, if X is compact and Y is T2 (Hausdorff), and f : X → Y is bijective and continuous, then f is a homeomorphism. `IsHomeomorph f` is the Mathlib proposition that the function f is a homeomorphism between X and Y.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Assumptions match exactly: [CompactSpace X] corresponds to X compact; [T2Space Y] corresponds to Y Hausdorff; `Bijective f` and `Continuous f` match the continuous bijection premise.
- Conclusion `IsHomeomorph f` matches “f is a homeomorphism.” Using the Prop form rather than constructing a `Homeomorph X Y` structure is a standard and faithful way to state this.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code relies purely on Mathlib types and classes. The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. There are no extra hypotheses or weakenings. The Lean statement is a direct formalization of the natural language claim.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- The section sets up a general scalar field 𝕜 (a nontrivially normed field) and normed spaces X and Y over 𝕜. This generalizes the natural language statement (which uses ℝ) to any nontrivially normed field; this is a reasonable slight generalization.
- theorem jirilebl_clm_add_continuous (A B : X →L[𝕜] Y) : Continuous (A + B)
  Translation: If A and B are continuous linear maps from X to Y, then their sum A + B (also a continuous linear map) is continuous as a function X → Y. Comment says “hence bounded,” which uses the equivalence of continuity and boundedness for linear maps in normed spaces.
- theorem jirilebl_clm_smul_continuous (α : 𝕜) (A : X →L[𝕜] Y) : Continuous (α • A)
  Translation: If A is a continuous linear map and α is a scalar, then the scalar multiple α • A is continuous as a function X → Y (hence bounded).
- theorem jirilebl_op_norm_nonneg (f : X →L[𝕜] Y) : 0 ≤ ‖f‖
  Translation: The operator norm is nonnegative.
- theorem jirilebl_op_norm_eq_zero_iff (f : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ‖f‖ = 0 ↔ f = 0
  Translation: The operator norm is definite: it vanishes iff the operator is the zero map.
- theorem jirilebl_op_norm_triangle (A B : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ‖A + B‖ ≤ ‖A‖ + ‖B‖
  Translation: Triangle inequality for the operator norm.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- First part: “If A,B : X → Y are linear and bounded operators, then A + B is bounded.” In mathlib, “linear and bounded” is represented by X →L[𝕜] Y (continuous linear map). A + B is indeed of type X →L[𝕜] Y, so it is a bounded linear operator. The theorem they stated only asserts continuity of A + B, not the boundedness directly. However, since A + B is already a continuous linear map by type, boundedness follows. Still, the theorem statement emphasizes continuity rather than stating the closure of bounded operators under addition.
- Second part: “If α ∈ ℝ, then αA is bounded.” They state continuity for α • A, which again implies boundedness, and the type ensures α • A is a continuous linear map. They also generalize from ℝ to an arbitrary nontrivially normed field 𝕜. This is a reasonable and standard generalization.
- Third part: “Show that ‖·‖_{L(X,Y)} is a norm on L(X,Y).” They include nonnegativity, definiteness, and the triangle inequality for the operator norm. However, they do not include the homogeneity axiom for a norm on a vector space, namely ‖α • f‖ = ‖α‖ ⋅ ‖f‖ (or for ℝ, |α|‖f‖). This is a substantive omission if the intent is to establish that the operator norm is a norm in the usual sense on the vector space L(X,Y). Mathlib’s notion of a norm on a normed additive group does not require homogeneity, but the natural language statement says “is a norm on L(X,Y),” which traditionally includes the scalar homogeneity property. So this part is incomplete as a translation.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- The first two components are essentially captured, albeit stated as continuity instead of boundedness; given the context (continuous linear maps) this is acceptable as a slight rephrasing/generalization.
- The third component is incomplete: the code omits the homogeneity property ‖α • f‖ = ‖α‖‖f‖, which is part of the usual definition of a norm on a vector space (and is what the problem likely expects). Therefore the translation is not fully faithful.

Conclusion: No vacuous definitions are introduced; all statements are meaningful in Mathlib. The generalization to 𝕜 is fine. However, missing the homogeneity axiom for the norm means the “norm” part of the statement is not faithfully translated. Also, the first two theorems are phrased in terms of continuity rather than boundedness; while essentially correct, they are not the most direct formal translations.

The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the instructions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Let X be a metric space and suppose that X is sequentially compact. Prove that every open cover of X admits a finite subcover."" In Mathlib, ""every open cover has a finite subcover"" is precisely the definition of `CompactSpace X`. The hypothesis ""X is sequentially compact"" is embodied by `[SeqCompactSpace X]` (a standard way to express sequential compactness of the whole space as a typeclass). Thus, the theorem statement directly matches the natural language claim.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Assumptions: Metric space + sequential compactness match `[MetricSpace X]` and `[SeqCompactSpace X]`.
- Conclusion: ""every open cover has a finite subcover"" matches `CompactSpace X`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The code uses standard Mathlib notions and provides a succinct formalization of the statement. Therefore, the two problems are the same.

- class LocallySimplyConnected (X : Type _) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop: Introduces a predicate/class named ""LocallySimplyConnected"" on a topological space X. It has no fields: it serves as an assumption placeholder stating ""X is locally simply connected"" without providing a definition.

The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural language: ""Prove that the fundamental group of any compact, path connected, and locally simply connected topological space is finitely generated.""
- The code assumes: TopologicalSpace X, CompactSpace X (compact), PathConnectedSpace X (path connected), LocallySimplyConnected X (locally simply connected). Matches the statement’s hypotheses.
- Conclusion: ∀ x : X, Group.FG (FundamentalGroup X x). This asserts finite generation of the fundamental group for every basepoint, which matches the intended meaning in a path connected space (fundamental groups at different basepoints are isomorphic, so finite generation is basepoint-independent). This is a faithful formalization of “the fundamental group is finitely generated.”

Step 3: Check for discrepancies or red flags
- The only auxiliary definition is LocallySimplyConnected, introduced as an uninterpreted predicate (a class/Prop with no fields). This is not defined as True or via a placeholder with content; it is simply a named assumption representing the property. As a translation of the statement, this is acceptable: the theorem is stated under the assumption that X satisfies this predicate. There is no cheating (no vacuous truths), and no misuse of Mathlib concepts.
- The theorem is stated for all basepoints; that is consistent with the natural language intent and is, if anything, the expected precise formalization.
- No other extraneous assumptions are added; no important assumptions are missing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language statement. The use of an uninterpreted predicate for local simple connectivity is acceptable for a statement-only translation and does not render the statement vacuous.

- `Continuous f → IsProperMap f → T2Space Y → LocallyCompactSpace Y → IsClosedMap f` States that if f is continuous, f is a proper map, Y is Hausdorff (T2), and Y is locally compact, then f is a closed map.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Every proper map f : X → Y to a locally compact Hausdorff space Y is a closed map."" In standard usage (and in Mathlib), a ""proper map"" entails the property captured by `IsProperMap f` (which in Mathlib is the usual notion of properness; in many contexts, the term ""proper map"" also presumes continuity). The Lean statement assumes `IsProperMap f` and explicitly also assumes `Continuous f`. If `IsProperMap f` in Mathlib already implies continuity, the extra `Continuous f` hypothesis is redundant but harmless. The requirements on Y (Hausdorff via `T2Space Y` and locally compact via `LocallyCompactSpace Y`) match the description ""to a locally compact Hausdorff space Y"". The conclusion `IsClosedMap f` is exactly ""f is a closed map"".

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The Lean theorem precisely encodes: for any f : X → Y, if f is proper and Y is locally compact Hausdorff, then f is closed. It includes an explicit continuity hypothesis; this is either part of the definition of ""proper map"" or redundant if Mathlib's `IsProperMap` already includes continuity. In either case, the mathematical content matches the natural language statement. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

- The Lean theorem: under the assumptions that X is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`), Y is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), and f is continuous (`Continuous f`), it concludes `IsProperMap f`, i.e., f is proper. This matches exactly.
- In Mathlib, `T2Space` is the standard class for Hausdorff, and `IsProperMap f` is the standard property expressing properness of a map between topological spaces. The inclusion of continuity as a separate hypothesis aligns with the phrasing “every continuous map … is proper.”

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- Context: E and F are normed real vector spaces, with E finite-dimensional. f : E →L[ℝ] F is a continuous linear map. This generalizes the original ℝ^n → ℝ^m setting (acceptable generalization).
- Statement: The theorem asserts three equalities for the operator norm of f:
  1) opNorm f = ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ = 1), ‖f x‖
  2) opNorm f = ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ ≤ 1), ‖f x‖
  3) opNorm f = ⨆ (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ < 1), ‖f x‖
  Here ⨆ denotes the (indexed) supremum. Writing ⨆ (x) (hx : P x), g x is Lean’s way to take the supremum of g x over those x satisfying P x (the inner iSup over proofs is either the constant value when P x holds, or over an empty type otherwise, which effectively removes those x). Thus, semantically, each line reads as “the operator norm equals the supremum of ‖f x‖ over the unit sphere/closed unit ball/open unit ball.”

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- The natural statement for ℝ^n → ℝ^m says: ‖A‖ = max{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ = 1} = sup{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} = sup{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ < 1}, using compactness of the unit sphere to justify the maximum being attained.
- The Lean code captures the equalities with the suprema over the unit sphere, closed unit ball, and open unit ball. However, it does not express that the supremum over the unit sphere is a maximum (i.e., that it is attained). There is no existence statement ∃ x, ‖x‖ = 1 ∧ ‖f x‖ = opNorm f, nor an explicit “max” operator. Thus, the attainment (the “max”) part is missing from the formal statement.
- The generalization from ℝ^n, ℝ^m to arbitrary finite-dimensional E and general F is acceptable and faithful in spirit.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Same aspects: Equality of the operator norm with the suprema over the closed and open unit balls, and over the unit sphere (as a supremum), matches the content of the latter parts of the natural statement.
- Differences: The key additional claim in the natural statement—that the value on the unit sphere is a maximum (attained)—is not encoded in the Lean theorem. The Lean statement only uses supremum, not maximum, and includes no attainment/existence clause. Therefore, the formalization is strictly weaker than the original statement.

Conclusion: Near pass but not faithful due to omission of the attainment (“max”) claim.

  In words: Given topological spaces X and Y, with X compact (`[CompactSpace X]`) and Y Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), and a function f : X → Y that is bijective and continuous, produce a homeomorphism between X and Y. `X ≃ₜ Y` is the type of homeomorphisms. The `noncomputable` modifier is harmless here. However, the body is `by sorry`, i.e., a placeholder without construction/proof.

2) Faithfulness of the translation:
- The statement of the def matches the natural language theorem exactly: it asserts that a continuous bijection from compact to Hausdorff yields a homeomorphism. The use of standard Mathlib classes (`CompactSpace`, `T2Space`) and concepts (`Function.Bijective`, `Continuous`, `X ≃ₜ Y`) is correct and up-to-date.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Mathematically, the type signature matches the intended theorem. However, the implementation is vacuous: the definition is given with `sorry`, providing no actual homeomorphism. Per the guidelines, any use of `sorry` or vacuous content causes the translation to fail. There are no auxiliary fake definitions; the only issue is the placeholder proof/body.

Conclusion: While the statement matches perfectly, the presence of `sorry` makes it a non-legitimate translation per the rules.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {m : ℕ}`: We fix a natural number m, working on R^m modeled as functions `Fin m → ℝ`.
- First theorem: `theorem operator_norm_eq_sups (A : (Fin m → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) : ‖A‖ = ⨆ (x : Fin m → ℝ) (hx : ‖x‖ = 1), ‖A x‖`.
  Natural language: For a continuous linear operator A on R^m, the operator norm ‖A‖ equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over all x with ‖x‖ = 1 (the unit sphere). This uses the built-in operator norm of a continuous linear map in mathlib and expresses it as a supremum over the unit sphere.
- Second theorem: `theorem operator_norm_eq_supr_closed_ball (A : (Fin m → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) : ‖A‖ = ⨆ (x : Fin m → ℝ) (hx : ‖x‖ ≤ 1), ‖A x‖`.
  Natural language: For A as above, ‖A‖ equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the closed unit ball.
- Third theorem: `theorem operator_norm_eq_supr_open_ball (A : (Fin m → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) : ‖A‖ = ⨆ (x : Fin m → ℝ) (hx : ‖x‖ < 1), ‖A x‖`.
  Natural language: For A as above, ‖A‖ equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the open unit ball.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The original statement: For a linear operator A on ℝ^n, with the operator norm defined by max over the unit sphere, show it equals sup over the closed unit ball and equals sup over the open unit ball.
- The Lean code phrases the result for continuous linear maps on `(Fin m → ℝ)` (which is ℝ^m) and uses the mathlib operator norm ‖A‖, giving equalities with suprema over the unit sphere, the closed unit ball, and the open unit ball.
- Differences:
  • “Linear operator” vs “continuous linear map”: In finite dimension these are equivalent (all linear maps are continuous), so this is a harmless refinement.
  • ℝ^n vs `(Fin m → ℝ)`: These are isomorphic models of ℝ^m; harmless.
  • Norm on ℝ^n: The code uses the default norm on `(Fin m → ℝ)` (the sup norm), while the natural language likely intends the Euclidean norm. However, the identities relating the operator norm to suprema over the sphere/balls hold in any normed finite-dimensional space, so the content is still faithful (indeed even slightly more general).
  • The statement uses “max” on the unit sphere as the definition of ‖A‖, whereas the code uses mathlib’s operator norm and equates it to supremum over the sphere. In finite dimensions the max equals the supremum due to compactness and continuity, so this is essentially equivalent. The code does not explicitly mention max, but showing equality to those sups is exactly what the problem asks; including the sphere version is an extra but consistent fact.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The mathematical content matches: the code asserts that the operator norm equals the sup over the unit sphere, closed unit ball, and open unit ball. This covers and slightly extends the requested equalities. The slight differences in model (Fin m → ℝ), continuity, and norm choice do not change the essence of the statement in finite dimensions. The use of supremum rather than maximum is acceptable since in this setting they coincide.

Thus, the translation is faithful. I deduct a tiny amount because the natural language defines the norm via max, whereas the code uses the standard mathlib definition and states equality to sups; but mathematically these are equivalent in this context.

- `theorem compact_space_prod_of_compact_spaces : CompactSpace (X × Y) := by sorry` states that the product space X × Y is compact, given the above assumptions. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we are only checking the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Let X and Y be compact topological spaces. Prove that every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover."" In Mathlib, ""every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover"" is precisely the definition of X × Y being compact as a space, i.e., `CompactSpace (X × Y)`. Therefore, the theorem statement is an exact formalization of the natural statement.

3) Final check:
- Assumptions match: both assume X and Y are compact topological spaces.
- Conclusion matches: compactness of the product space is equivalent to every open cover of X × Y having a finite subcover.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the only entity is a standard `CompactSpace` conclusion.
Thus, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  Translation: For any type α with a topology (TopologicalSpace α), and any subset s of α, if s is closed (IsClosed s) and the whole space α is compact ([CompactSpace α] is an instance asserting α is compact), then s is compact (IsCompact s). The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for checking translation.

Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that a closed subset of a compact space is compact."" The Lean theorem states exactly this: closed subset (IsClosed s) of a compact space ([CompactSpace α]) is compact (IsCompact s), universally quantified over any topological space α and subset s. No extra assumptions and no weakening.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. All concepts are standard Mathlib ones.
- The use of an instance [CompactSpace α] matches ""α is compact"" in topology formalization.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- import Mathlib: We use Mathlib.
- universe u: Universe level declaration.
- class LocallySimplyConnected (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := mk ::
  This introduces a class (a Prop) named LocallySimplyConnected for a topological space X, but it has no fields at all. It's a placeholder: it carries no actual content or definition of local simple connectivity. Any instance would be trivial to construct since the constructor has no fields.
- def IsFinitelyGenerated (G : Type u) [Group G] : Prop := ∃ S : Set G, Set.Finite S ∧ Subgroup.closure S = ⊤
  This correctly defines a group G to be finitely generated if there exists a finite subset S whose subgroup closure is the whole group.
- theorem compact_locally_simply_connected_fundamental_group_fg (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] [CompactSpace X] [LocallySimplyConnected X] (x : X) [Group (FundamentalGroup X x)] : IsFinitelyGenerated (FundamentalGroup X x) := by sorry
  This states: For any type X with a topology, if X is compact and (assumed) locally simply connected (via the class above), then for any basepoint x in X, assuming a Group instance on FundamentalGroup X x, the fundamental group π1(X, x) is finitely generated. The proof is omitted (sorry). The extra [Group (FundamentalGroup X x)] is a placeholder to ensure typeclass resolution; in Mathlib this is typically an existing instance.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Original: ""Show that every compact, locally simply connected topological space has finitely generated fundamental group.""
- The theorem’s quantification over all compact spaces and choice of basepoint matches the standard formalization of fundamental group (which depends on a basepoint). Not requiring path-connectedness is fine.
- IsFinitelyGenerated is correctly formalized.
- However, the key assumption ""LocallySimplyConnected"" is defined as a vacuous placeholder class with no content, not tied to Mathlib’s actual notion (and likely no such class exists in Mathlib under that exact name). This means the statement does not faithfully represent the intended topological property; it’s an empty stub.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- The presence of a vacuous placeholder for local simple connectivity violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous. Thus the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.
- The added assumption [Group (FundamentalGroup X x)] is a harmless technical artifact to make the statement typecheck.
- Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous definition of LocallySimplyConnected.

Grade justification:
- There is a vacuous placeholder definition. If that were replaced by a proper definition/instance capturing local simple connectivity, the theorem statement would align with the natural language statement (modulo the explicit basepoint), so this fits the rubric for a 6.

  Natural language: For topological spaces X and Y, assuming Y is locally compact and Hausdorff, and given a function f : X → Y which is continuous (hf), injective (h_inj), and closed as a map (h_closed), we construct (noncomputably) a homeomorphism between X and the image of f (as the subtype Set.range f). The `sorry` indicates the proof/construction is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: ""Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space and f : X → Y a closed injection. Prove that f is a homeomorphism onto its image.""
- The Lean statement assumes:
  - Y is locally compact (LocallyCompactSpace Y) and Hausdorff (T2Space Y), matching the NL statement.
  - f is injective and a closed map, matching ""closed injection"".
  - Additionally, Lean explicitly assumes f is continuous (hf : Continuous f). In standard topology phrasing, ""map"" usually implies continuity, but here the NL phrasing says ""closed injection"" without explicitly saying ""continuous"". However, for the conclusion to be true, continuity is needed. Thus, the Lean version is a natural and standard formalization of the intended theorem.
- The conclusion in Lean is a concrete homeomorphism `X ≃ₜ Set.range f`, which exactly means f is a homeomorphism onto its image (the image carries the subspace topology, which is exactly the subtype topology on Set.range f).

3) Final check for differences:
- Extra assumption: Continuity of f is required in Lean but not explicitly stated in the NL sentence. This is a mild specialization and aligns with the usual meaning in topology where one discusses continuous maps; without continuity the result is false, so the Lean statement is faithful to the intended mathematical content.
- Extra structure: The assumptions that Y is locally compact Hausdorff match the NL; though they are not necessary for the general theorem (continuity + injectivity + closed map suffice without local compactness), this does not harm faithfulness—it's a specialization consistent with the NL statement.
- Form of conclusion: Lean provides a homeomorphism to Set.range f, which is precisely “homeomorphism onto its image.” It does not explicitly assert that the forward map is exactly f followed by inclusion, but a homeomorphism of this type can be (and typically is) chosen to be induced by f. Since the code only states the existence/definition of such a homeomorphism, this matches the claim’s intent.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions: There are no auxiliary placeholder definitions; only the main declaration with a sorry proof, which is acceptable per the instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization with a slightly stronger explicit assumption (continuity), which is standard and necessary. Therefore, it passes.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- def my_contractible_space (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True

- def my_homotopy_group (X : Type u) (n : ℕ) (x : X) : Type := PUnit

- def my_trivial_homotopy_groups (X : Type u) : Prop := ∀ (n : ℕ) (x : X), my_homotopy_group X n x = PUnit
  This says X has “trivial homotopy groups” if for all n and basepoints x, the placeholder my_homotopy_group equals PUnit. Since my_homotopy_group is definitionally PUnit, this property is tautologically true for every X.

- lemma contractible_space_connected_and_trivial_homotopy_groups ... : ConnectedSpace X ∧ my_trivial_homotopy_groups (X := X) := by sorry
  The statement claims: if X is “my_contractible_space” (i.e., True), then X is a ConnectedSpace and has trivial homotopy groups in the placeholder sense. The proof is omitted with sorry. The actual first conjunct, ConnectedSpace X, is a genuine mathlib predicate; however the hypothesis and the second conjunct are placeholder predicates.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- Original: “Every contractible space is connected and has trivial homotopy groups.”
- Code: uses a vacuous definition of contractibility (always True) and a vacuous definition of homotopy groups (always PUnit), making the “trivial homotopy groups” condition tautological. Therefore the code does not express the genuine mathematical content.

Step 3: Final check of differences
- Contractibility: In math, contractible means the identity is homotopic to a constant map (or existence of a global contraction). In the code, my_contractible_space X := True, which declares every space contractible. This is a critical mismatch.
- Homotopy groups: In math, π_n(X, x) are nontrivial structures (groups for n ≥ 1). In the code, they are definitionally PUnit for all n and x, so “triviality” is built in and not a result.
- Quantification over n: The code quantifies over all n : ℕ. In standard statements, one typically separates connectedness (π_0 trivial/space connected) and triviality of π_n for n ≥ 1. Even if this minor point can be aligned, the placeholders already invalidate faithfulness.
- Proof: The statement uses sorry; while missing proofs might be acceptable for translation checking, the core issue is not the proof but the placeholder/vacuous definitions.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. It replaces key concepts with vacuous placeholders, so the theorem statement becomes meaningless relative to the intended mathematics.

This is a placeholder and does not model the actual fundamental group (which should be a group, typically a quotient of loops modulo homotopy).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The fundamental group is replaced by PUnit, a vacuous stand-in, not the true π1 with group structure.
- The property “finitely generated” is defined as `True` for any type, ignoring group structure entirely.
- The hypotheses that G is a “finite connected graph” are replaced by `True` placeholders (`h_finite_graph : True` and `h_connected : True`), not actual definitions using Mathlib’s graph theory or topological graph concepts.
- The theorem statement itself references an arbitrary topological space `G` rather than a graph structure, and the conclusion is trivial due to the placeholder definitions.

- Natural language: “Any connected finite graph has finitely generated fundamental group.” This refers to actual finite graphs (combinatorial/topological), real fundamental group π1, and finite generation as a group-theoretic property.
- Lean code: Asserts a trivially true proposition from trivial hypotheses, with fake definitions for both the fundamental group and finite generation, and no genuine encoding of “finite connected graph.” Therefore, it is not a legitimate or faithful formalization of the statement.

Given the guidelines:
- Multiple vacuous placeholder definitions are used (`fundamental_group := PUnit`, `FinitelyGenerated := True`, hypotheses as `True`).
- Even if the placeholders were replaced with proper definitions, the target theorem form (for an actual finite connected graph’s π1 being finitely generated) could be made faithful, so this falls under the rubric case where vacuous definitions are used but the intended final theorem could be faithful once fixed.

Conclusion: Not faithful. Grade reflects vacuity but recognizes the intended shape could be corrected to a faithful statement.

  Natural language: For any topological spaces X and Y, assuming X is compact and Y is Hausdorff (T2), and f : X → Y is continuous, then f is a closed map (i.e., it sends closed sets to closed sets).

2) Compare to the original natural language statement:
- Original: ""Prove that if X is compact and f : X → Y is continuous, then f is closed.""
- The Lean statement adds the assumption that Y is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), which is not in the original.

3) Faithfulness assessment:
- Mathematically, the added Hausdorff hypothesis is standard and necessary for the conclusion ""f is closed"" via the compact-image-is-compact and compact subsets being closed in Hausdorff spaces. Without Hausdorff, the original statement is generally false.
- However, strictly as a translation, the Lean code does not match the original statement: it strengthens the hypotheses by requiring Y to be Hausdorff. There are no vacuous definitions or placeholders; the statement is legitimate and standard, but it is not the same as the given natural language statement.
- Therefore, while the Lean version is a correct and commonly assumed variant, it is not a faithful translation of the exact original statement due to the extra Hausdorff assumption.

Conclusion: Not faithful, but very close and arguably the intended correction.

- The theorem `compactSpace_prod_iff {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : CompactSpace (X × Y) ↔ CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y` states: For types X and Y equipped with topologies, the product space X × Y is compact if and only if X is compact and Y is compact. There are no extra hypotheses or auxiliary definitions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: “Topological spaces X and Y are both compact just when their product is compact.” This is precisely the logical equivalence asserted by the Lean statement: CompactSpace (X × Y) ↔ (CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y). Thus the code is a direct and faithful formalization.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no discrepancies: the Lean theorem exactly captures the biconditional between compactness of each factor and compactness of the product. No vacuous placeholders or misleading auxiliary definitions are used.

  Natural language: In a topological space X, X is sequentially compact if for every sequence u: ℕ → X, there exists a strictly increasing function f: ℕ → ℕ (a subsequence selector) and a point x ∈ X such that the subsequence u ∘ f converges to x (with respect to the usual notion of sequence convergence, expressed via filters).

  Natural language: For a metric space X, X is compact (i.e., the space has a `CompactSpace` structure, equivalent to the whole space being compact) if and only if X is sequentially compact (as defined above).

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that a metric space X is compact iff X is sequentially compact."" The Lean theorem states exactly this equivalence for `[MetricSpace X]`, with compactness expressed as `CompactSpace X` and sequential compactness defined in the standard way via convergent subsequences of sequences. This matches the intended mathematical meaning.
- The auxiliary definition `sequentially_compact` is legitimate and standard (no vacuous placeholders). It uses `StrictMono` to encode subsequences and `Filter.Tendsto` to encode convergence to some `x : X`.
- Restricting the equivalence to metric spaces aligns with the classical result; defining sequential compactness for any topological space is fine and standard.

3) Final check for differences:
- ""X is compact"" in plain language is represented by `CompactSpace X` in Lean; this is the standard translation.
- ""Sequentially compact"" is defined exactly as ""every sequence has a convergent subsequence (in X)""—the usual notion.
- No extraneous assumptions or weakenings are introduced; no vacuous definitions are used.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which contains the definitions of inner product spaces, continuous linear maps, and operator norms.
- Docstring: States the intended theorem: for any real inner product space E, the operator norm of the linear functional x ↦ ⟪b, x⟫ equals ‖b‖.
- `theorem innerSL_opNorm {E : Type*} [SeminormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E] (b : E) : (innerSL ℝ b).opNorm = ‖b‖ := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any real inner product space E, consider the continuous linear functional innerSL ℝ b : E →L[ℝ] ℝ given by x ↦ ⟪b, x⟫. Then its operator norm equals the norm of b, i.e., ∥innerSL ℝ b∥ = ∥b∥. There are no auxiliary definitions; `innerSL` and `opNorm` are standard Mathlib notions.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement is about E = ℝ^n with the standard Euclidean norm/inner product, and Bx = b · x (dot product). In Mathlib, on ℝ^n, the inner product is the dot product, and `innerSL ℝ b` is exactly the functional x ↦ ⟪b, x⟫ = b · x. The operator norm `.opNorm` is the standard operator norm on L(ℝ^n, ℝ). The Lean theorem states the result for any real inner product space, which strictly generalizes the ℝ^n case. This is a legitimate slight generalization that includes the original as a special case.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
- Original: For ℝ^n with Euclidean norm, the operator norm of Bx = b · x equals ‖b‖.
- Lean: For any real inner product space (hence including ℝ^n with Euclidean inner product), the operator norm of x ↦ ⟪b, x⟫ equals ‖b‖.
They match in meaning; the Lean statement is a standard generalization but fully faithful to the ℝ^n case. No vacuous placeholders or auxiliary fake definitions are used. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the full Mathlib environment.
- Docstring: States the intended meaning of ""proper"" in this file: a map is proper if the preimage of every compact set is compact.
- Theorem statement:
  - Context: `X`, `Y` are topological spaces; `X` is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`), `Y` is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`).
  - `f : X → Y` is a function with `hf : Continuous f`.
  - Claim: For every `K : Set Y`, if `K` is compact, then `f ⁻¹' K` is compact.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The natural statement: ""Prove that every continuous map f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is proper.""
- The code explicitly adopts the standard (and explicitly stated) definition of ""proper"": preimage of compact sets is compact. Under this definition, the theorem asserts exactly that a continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is proper.
- The hypotheses match: `X` compact, `Y` Hausdorff, `f` continuous. The conclusion matches the chosen definition of proper (preimage of compact is compact).

Step 3: Final check and potential discrepancies
- The code does not introduce any auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it directly states the desired property.
- The chosen definition of ""proper"" is explicitly clarified in the docstring and is a standard one in many contexts. While in some contexts other equivalent characterizations are used (e.g., closed map with compact fibers, or universal closedness), for Hausdorff targets these notions align with the preimage-of-compact definition, and the code commits to the latter.
- Minor note: The assumption that `X` is compact and `Y` is Hausdorff is not necessary for the conclusion ""preimage of compact is compact""—this holds for any continuous map. However, having stronger hypotheses does not harm faithfulness; the statement remains a correct formalization of the natural language claim under the stated definition of proper.
- The theorem uses `by sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable per the task (we are auditing the statement, not the proof). No placeholder/vacuous definitions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement, with an explicit and standard interpretation of ""proper.""

- Lean theorem: Assumes X is a complete metric space (extra hypothesis not in the natural statement) and requires S to be totally bounded (stronger than bounded). Conclusion is that S is compact.

3) Final check of faithfulness:
- Differences:
  - Completeness: The Lean code adds the hypothesis `[CompleteSpace X]`, which is not in the natural statement.
  - Total boundedness vs boundedness: The Lean code uses `TotallyBounded S` instead of `Bounded S`. In metric spaces, totally bounded implies bounded, but not conversely; so the Lean hypothesis is strictly stronger than the natural statement’s boundedness.
- Because of these differences, the Lean theorem proves a different statement: closed + totally bounded in a complete metric space implies compact, whereas the natural statement claims closed + bounded in any metric space implies compact (which is generally false). Hence, the translation is not faithful.
- No vacuous placeholders: The code references standard Mathlib notions (MetricSpace, CompleteSpace, TotallyBounded, IsClosed, IsCompact). Although the proof is `sorry`, we were told the code compiles and we audit only the statement. The issue is not vacuity but mismatch in content.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the given natural language statement due to stronger and additional hypotheses.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, so all topological constructions and types are standard.
- The theorem statement: `theorem one_point_compactification_homeomorphic_sphere (n : ℕ) : Nonempty (OnePoint (Fin n → ℝ) ≃ₜ {x : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ // dist x 0 = 1}) := by sorry`
  This asserts: For each natural number n, there exists a homeomorphism (i.e., a topological equivalence) between the one-point compactification of the space `Fin n → ℝ` and the unit sphere in `Fin (n+1) → ℝ`, where the sphere is represented as the subtype `{x : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ // dist x 0 = 1}`. The `≃ₜ` symbol denotes a homeomorphism. `Nonempty` expresses the existence of such a homeomorphism.

Step 2: Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: ""Prove that the one point compactification of R^n is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n.""
- In Lean:
  - `Fin n → ℝ` is a standard formalization of ℝ^n (n-tuples of reals) with the product topology, which is homeomorphic to the usual Euclidean ℝ^n. This is an acceptable and standard representation.
  - `OnePoint (Fin n → ℝ)` is the topological one-point compactification of this space, exactly as in the statement.
  - `{x : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ // dist x 0 = 1}` is the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}, i.e., S^n.
  - The goal `Nonempty (… ≃ₜ …)` states the existence of a homeomorphism between these spaces, which is precisely what “is homeomorphic to” means.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code uses a concrete model for ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ`. This is standard and faithful.
- The code defines S^n as the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1} via `dist x 0 = 1`, equivalent to ‖x‖ = 1; this matches the conventional definition of S^n.
- The statement is existential (Nonempty of a homeomorphism), aligning with “is homeomorphic to”.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the only placeholder is the proof `sorry`, which is acceptable per the auditing instructions focusing on translation, not proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Comparison to the given natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let X be a Hausdorff space and Y any topological space. If continuous maps f,g : X → Y agree on a dense subset of X, prove that f=g.""
- Lean theorem: Assumes Y is Hausdorff (T2) and X arbitrary.
- The roles of the Hausdorff assumption are swapped. The code requires the target Y to be Hausdorff, while the natural statement requires the domain X to be Hausdorff.
- Other components (continuity of f and g, agreement on a dense subset of X, conclusion f = g) match.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are different in a crucial way: which space is assumed Hausdorff. This is not a harmless technicality; the standard correct hypothesis for this uniqueness-by-density result is that the target space Y is Hausdorff, not the domain X. Thus the Lean code does not faithfully translate the provided natural language statement.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only issue is the mismatch in the Hausdorff assumption.

  Natural language: For each natural number n, there exists a homeomorphism (a topological isomorphism) between the one-point compactification of the space `Fin n → ℝ` and the subset of `Fin (n+1) → ℝ` consisting of those points at distance 1 from the origin. Here `Fin n → ℝ` is a standard Lean model for ℝ^n, and `{x | dist x 0 = 1}` is the (unit) sphere of radius 1 in ℝ^{n+1} with respect to the ambient metric. The result is stated as a homeomorphism `≃ₜ`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original claim is: ""Prove that the one-point compactification of ℝ^n is homeomorphic to the unit sphere S^n."" The code asserts exactly a homeomorphism between `OnePoint (Fin n → ℝ)` (one-point compactification of ℝ^n) and the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1} expressed as `{x | dist x 0 = 1}`. This matches the usual definition of S^n as the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}.
- Using `Fin n → ℝ` to model ℝ^n is standard in Mathlib. Using `dist x 0 = 1` to define the sphere is also standard (`Metric.sphere 0 1`).
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement is directly the homeomorphism existence/type.

3) Final check for differences:
- Minor technical nuance: the ambient norm/metric on `Fin (n+1) → ℝ` is the default one for that Pi type (not explicitly the Euclidean ℓ2 norm). However, the mathematical intent “unit sphere S^n” refers to the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}, and Mathlib’s `Metric.sphere` in a finite-dimensional real vector space gives a space homeomorphic to the usual S^n regardless of the chosen equivalent norm. This does not materially change the statement’s meaning in topology. Aside from this standard modeling choice, the translation is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language claim.

- The theorem is named `is_closed_eq_locus` and is parameterized by types `X` and `Y` with instances `[TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`, so both are topological spaces.
- `[T2Space Y]` assumes that `Y` is Hausdorff (T2 space in Mathlib terminology).
- `{f g : X → Y}` are two functions from `X` to `Y`.
- `(hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g)` assume both maps are continuous.
- The conclusion `IsClosed { x | f x = g x }` states that the set of points `x` in `X` where `f x = g x` is closed in `X`.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- Natural language: Take two continuous maps `f, g : X → Y`. Let `A ⊂ X` be the set of points at which `f = g`. If `Y` is Hausdorff, then `A` is closed.
- The Lean statement exactly matches: it assumes `Y` is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), `f` and `g` are continuous, and concludes that the set `{x | f x = g x}` (the equality locus) is closed.
- The code does not name the set `A`, but directly describes it, which is perfectly faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- No extra or missing assumptions: continuity of both maps is assumed; Hausdorff is on `Y`; closure is in `X` with its topology.
- No strengthening or weakening: it asserts exactly the closedness of the equality set.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions are introduced. The presence of `sorry` affects proof, not the statement. The task is about translation of the statement, which is faithful.

  `theorem eq_of_dense {A : Set X} (hA : Dense A) {f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g)
    (h : ∀ x ∈ A, f x = g x) : f = g := by sorry`
  This states: For a subset A of X, if A is dense (`Dense A`), and f, g : X → Y are continuous (`Continuous f`, `Continuous g`), and they agree on A (`∀ x ∈ A, f x = g x`), then f = g (as functions X → Y). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per the task since we are checking the statement, not the proof.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The Lean statement exactly captures the natural language statement: X is a topological space, A ⊆ X is dense, Y is Hausdorff, f and g are continuous X → Y, they agree on A, conclude f = g.
- All concepts used (Dense, Continuous, T2Space) are standard Mathlib notions; no placeholders or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- Natural language: “Prove that if X is a topological space and A ⊆ X is dense in X, then any two continuous functions f,g : X → Y into a Hausdorff space Y which agree on A must be equal.”
- Lean: Precisely the same hypotheses and conclusion: Dense A, [T2Space Y], f and g continuous, agreement on A implies f = g.
- No differences or unintended strengthening/weakening.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

1) Translate the Lean code:
- `theorem compact_space_pi_iff {ι : Type*} {X : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)] : CompactSpace (∀ i, X i) ↔ ∀ i, CompactSpace (X i)`
  This states: For a family of topological spaces (X i) indexed by ι, the product space (the dependent function type Π i, X i) is compact if and only if each factor X i is compact. This is the standard Tychonoff theorem equivalence (compactness of product iff compactness of each coordinate), with the reverse direction following from continuity of projections.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: ""Prove that every product of topological spaces is compact if and only if a product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
- Interpreted formally, this is: (∀ families of topological spaces, their product is compact) ↔ (∀ families of compact topological spaces, their product is compact). The right-hand side is Tychonoff; the left-hand side is a much stronger and generally false statement. As an equivalence, it's not logically equivalent to the standard Tychonoff equivalence in the code.
- The code’s theorem is a per-family equivalence: for each given family (X i), ProductCompact ↔ (∀ i, XiCompact). The natural language quantifies over all families in both sides but with very different predicates, making the two sides not equivalent to the code’s statement.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- No. The code states: For each specific family, the product is compact iff each factor is compact.
- The natural language (as written) states: The global claim ""every product is compact"" is equivalent to the global claim ""every product of compact spaces is compact"". These are not equivalent and the first is false in general; moreover, this is a different logical structure than the code.
- Therefore the translation is not faithful, despite being on the same topic.

Additional notes:
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; just a theorem with `sorry`. The mismatch is purely in the mathematical meaning of the statement.

theorem opNorm_euclidean {n : ℕ} (a : Fin n → ℝ) : (scalar_mul_map a).opNorm = ‖a‖ := by sorry
",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and opens the ContinuousLinearMap namespace, so we are working with continuous linear maps and their operator norms.
- The definition `scalar_mul_map {n : ℕ} (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ →L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)` constructs the continuous linear map A: ℝ → (Fin n → ℝ) given by A x = x • a. Concretely, it uses `LinearMap.smulRight (LinearMap.id : ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ) a`, which is the linear map sending x to x • a, and then promotes it to a continuous linear map via `.toContinuousLinearMap`.
- The theorem `opNorm_euclidean {n : ℕ} (a : Fin n → ℝ) : (scalar_mul_map a).opNorm = ‖a‖` states that the operator norm of this map equals the norm of the vector a in the codomain. This matches the mathematical claim that the operator norm of x ↦ x a is ‖a‖.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Given A ∈ L(ℝ, ℝ^n) defined by A x = x a for a ∈ ℝ^n, show that ‖A‖ = ‖a‖, using the standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^n. 
- The code models ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ`, and defines A exactly as x ↦ x • a. It then claims `(scalar_mul_map a).opNorm = ‖a‖`, i.e., the operator norm equals the norm of a in the codomain. This is the correct formal counterpart of the statement.

Potential discrepancy:
- The comment claims “we use the standard euclidean norm,” but the type used is `(Fin n → ℝ)`. In Mathlib, the default norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the sup norm (coming from the general Pi-type normed structure), not the Euclidean L2 norm. The Euclidean norm is the canonical one on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, a type alias for `(Fin n → ℝ)` with an InnerProductSpace instance. 
- Thus, strictly speaking, the code as written proves the statement for the default norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)` (typically the sup norm), not necessarily the Euclidean norm. However, the equality ‖A‖ = ‖a‖ is true for any normed target space E (since sup_{|x|≤1} ‖x•a‖ = ‖a‖), so this is a harmless generalization: the code’s theorem is at least as strong as the Euclidean version. 

Final comparison:
- Structure of the map and statement match precisely: A is x ↦ x • a, and the conclusion is that the operator norm equals the norm of a. 
- The only difference is the implicit choice of norm on ℝ^n: the natural language explicitly specifies Euclidean; the code uses `(Fin n → ℝ)` which by default carries the sup norm unless one uses `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. Since the result holds in any normed space, this is a slight generalization rather than a substantive mismatch.

Verdict:
- The translation is essentially faithful and legitimate, with a minor technical nuance about the norm instance. If one wanted to be perfectly aligned with the Euclidean norm phrasing, one could replace `(Fin n → ℝ)` by `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` in the codomain. Otherwise the mathematical content is the same or stronger.

- `theorem continuous_symm_of_equiv_of_continuous_tac_10505 {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Bijective f) (hf' : Continuous f) : Continuous (Equiv.ofBijective f hf).symm := by sorry`
  • Universe and topological space instances declare X and Y as topological spaces.
  • `[T2Space Y]` encodes that Y is Hausdorff.
  • `f : X → Y`, `hf : Bijective f` encodes bijectivity of f.
  • `hf' : Continuous f` encodes continuity of f.
  • Conclusion: `Continuous (Equiv.ofBijective f hf).symm` states the inverse map (constructed as the symmetric of the equivalence induced by a bijection) is continuous.
  • No auxiliary definitions; `Equiv.ofBijective f hf` is the standard equivalence constructed from a bijection and `.symm` its inverse function `Y → X`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If f: X → Y is a continuous bijection from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y, then the inverse f^{-1}: Y → X is continuous.
- Lean code: Exactly matches these hypotheses and conclusion. The inverse is represented as `(Equiv.ofBijective f hf).symm` and continuity is asserted. Y is Hausdorff via `[T2Space Y]`. No extra or missing conditions.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The two statements are the same: same hypotheses (topological spaces, Y Hausdorff, f continuous and bijective) and same conclusion (inverse is continuous). No extraneous definitions or placeholders; no vacuous constructs. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing as it does not alter the statement.

Note: Although the mathematical statement is generally false without additional hypotheses (e.g., compactness of X), our task is to audit faithfulness of translation, which it satisfies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def MyPathConnected (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`
  This introduces a custom predicate `MyPathConnected` on a topological space X, but it is defined to be always true. It is a placeholder and does not capture actual path connectedness.
- `def MyLocallySimplyConnected (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`
  This introduces a custom predicate `MyLocallySimplyConnected` on a topological space X, also defined to be always true. It is a placeholder and does not capture actual local simple connectedness.
- `def MyHasUniversalCoveringSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`
  This introduces a custom predicate stating that X has a universal covering space, defined to be always true. It is a placeholder and does not express the existence of a space \tilde{X} and a covering map \tilde{X} → X with the universal property.
- `theorem exists_universal_covering_space (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] (hpc : MyPathConnected X) (hlsc : MyLocallySimplyConnected X) : MyHasUniversalCoveringSpace X := by sorry`
  This theorem states: for any topological space X, from the hypotheses `MyPathConnected X` and `MyLocallySimplyConnected X`, conclude `MyHasUniversalCoveringSpace X`. However, since each predicate is defined as `True`, the hypotheses and conclusion are vacuous; the statement reduces to True → True → True. Moreover, the proof is `by sorry`, i.e., omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts: Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space X has a universal covering space \tilde{X} → X. The Lean code replaces the genuine notions (path connectedness, local simple connectedness, and the existence of a universal covering space with an explicit covering map) by vacuous placeholders that are always true. It does not encode the existence of a covering map or the universal property, nor the existence of a space \tilde{X}. Thus, the formal statement is not a faithful translation.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
No. The Lean code is entirely vacuous due to the definitions `:= True` and provides no content corresponding to the actual topological notions or the existence of a universal covering space. The presence of `sorry` in the theorem further underscores that no argument is given. Even if `sorry` were replaced by a proof, the theorem would remain vacuous because the predicates are trivial. If the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib definitions capturing path connectedness, locally simply connectedness, and the existence of a universal cover (e.g., existence of a covering map with the universal property), then the structure of the theorem would align with the natural language claim. As written, it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Discrepancies:
- Uses custom placeholder predicates instead of Mathlib notions.
- All placeholder predicates are defined as True (vacuous).
- Does not assert or construct a map \tilde{X} → X or the universal property; it only asserts a trivial Prop.
- Contains an unproven `sorry`.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

  Natural language: Let X and Y be topological spaces, both path-connected and Hausdorff. Let f : X → Y be a covering map, with a chosen basepoint x0 in X and y0 in Y such that y0 = f x0. Then the function from the fundamental group π1(Y, y0) to Unit, given by q ↦ Unit, is bijective.
  Comments: The conclusion asserts the bijectivity of a function whose domain is FundamentalGroup Y y0 and codomain is Unit (the singleton type). The function body ignores q and returns Unit (as a type rather than a term), and does not use f, hf, x0, or h in defining the map.

2) Comparison with the original statement:
- Original: If X and Y are path connected Hausdorff spaces and f : X → Y is a covering map with y0 = f(x0), then the canonical map π1(Y, y0) / f_*(π1(X, x0)) → X_{y0} (the fiber over y0) is bijective.
- Code: Claims a function π1(Y, y0) → Unit is bijective.
- Mismatches:
  - Domain: Original uses the quotient of the fundamental group by the subgroup f_*(π1(X, x0)); code uses the entire fundamental group with no quotient and does not mention f_* at all.
  - Codomain: Original codomain is the fiber X_{y0} = {x ∈ X | f x = y0}; code uses Unit, the singleton type, which is unrelated to the fiber (and would imply the fiber is a singleton, which is not generally true).
  - Map definition: The original map is the monodromy-induced map sending a coset to the endpoint of the lifted loop starting at x0; the code defines a trivial constant map ignoring all structure, and even ignores the proof-relevant data hf, x0, h in the function.
  - Conceptual content: The code’s conclusion, if taken at face value, would imply π1(Y, y0) is in bijection with a singleton, i.e., trivial, which is not the intended statement and is false in general.
  - Technical issue: The written function (fun q => Unit) returns a type, not a term of type Unit; even setting that aside, the intended map is not represented at all.

3) Final check:
The formal statement is not a faithful translation. It has the wrong domain, the wrong codomain, no quotient, no fiber, and the function is a trivial constant function unrelated to the covering map. Therefore the two math problems are different.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The docstring states: ""If m < n, any C^1 map f : (Fin m → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) has nowhere dense image.""
- The theorem `isNowhereDense_range_fin_fun_of_lt` takes natural numbers `m, n` with `h : m < n`, and a function `f : (Fin m → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)` assumed to be `C^1` (`hf : ContDiff ℝ 1 f`). The conclusion is `IsNowhereDense (Set.range f)`, meaning the image of `f` is nowhere dense in the ambient space `(Fin n → ℝ)`.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; it relies on Mathlib concepts: `ContDiff`, `IsNowhereDense`, and the standard representation of ℝ^m as `(Fin m → ℝ)`.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For a smooth map φ: P → Q between smooth manifolds with `dim P < dim Q`, show φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.
- Lean code: For a `C^1` map between Euclidean spaces ℝ^m and ℝ^n (modeled as `(Fin m → ℝ)`), with `m < n`, the image is nowhere dense in ℝ^n.
- Similarities: Dimensional inequality hypothesis and the conclusion about the image being nowhere dense are aligned. The regularity requirement in Lean (C^1) is weaker than smooth, so it's acceptable as a generalization in regularity.
- Differences: The domain and codomain in Lean are Euclidean spaces, not arbitrary smooth manifolds. The natural statement is global for arbitrary manifolds, while the code treats only the special case of ℝ^m → ℝ^n. Thus, the Lean theorem is a specialization in the category of spaces.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are not identical: the Lean code proves a special case (Euclidean spaces) of the general manifold statement. There are no vacuous placeholders; all notions are standard. This is a strong, meaningful special case and a reasonable step toward the manifold result, but it does not fully capture the full generality of the natural language statement. Hence, it's not a fully faithful translation, though it is very close in spirit and content.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- def I := {t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1}: Defines the closed unit interval as a subtype of ℝ. This matches [0,1].
- def leftI, rightI: Define the endpoints 0 and 1 in I. Correct.
- class SmoothManifold (M) [TopologicalSpace M] : Prop where out : True: This is a placeholder/vacuous class. It does not use Mathlib's manifold structure (charted spaces, smoothness, etc.). Red flag.
- def smooth_path (γ : I → M) : Prop := True: Vacuous predicate; every path is declared smooth. Red flag.
- def homotopy_rel_endpoints (x y : I → M) : Prop := ∃ H : I → I → M, ...: A homotopy between x and y relative endpoints, but with only pointwise boundary equalities and no continuity requirement for H. The boundary conditions are:
  • H t 0 = x t and H t 1 = y t (good for start/end of homotopy),
  • H 0 s = x 0 and H 1 s = x 1 (endpoints fixed along the homotopy). This also implies y 0 = x 0 and y 1 = x 1. However, continuity of H is completely missing, so this is too weak compared to the standard definition.
- theorem exists_smooth_path_homotopic_rel_endpoints ... : ∃ y, smooth_path y ∧ homotopy_rel_endpoints x y := by sorry: States existence of a smooth y homotopic rel endpoints to x. Given smooth_path is True and homotopy ignores continuity, this becomes trivial. Also uses the vacuous SmoothManifold class. Proof omitted, which is acceptable per task, but the statement is already too weak.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
The original statement: For a smooth manifold M and a path x : [0,1] → M, x is homotopic relative {0,1} to a smooth path. Standard meanings: M has a manifold structure (with charts), x is a continuous path, y should be smooth, and the homotopy H : [0,1]×[0,1] → M is continuous and fixes endpoints for all s.
The Lean code deviates in multiple key ways:
- Smooth manifold is a vacuous Prop, not Mathlib’s manifold structure.
- Path x is any function I → M; no continuity requirement.
- smooth_path is vacuous (True), so the smoothness requirement is lost.
- homotopy_rel_endpoints lacks any continuity requirement for H.
Thus the formal statement is far weaker and essentially trivial, unlike the mathematical claim.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
No. The Lean version removes essential analytic/topological content (manifold structure, continuity of paths and homotopies, and smoothness), replacing them with vacuous predicates. Even if the equalities at the boundary are captured, the core notion of homotopy and smooth path is not faithfully represented. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Multiple vacuous placeholders (SmoothManifold, smooth_path) and missing continuity in homotopy. However, if these were replaced by the proper Mathlib notions, the final theorem statement would match the natural language claim. This fits the rubric ""makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful"" → grade around 6.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Uses Mathlib's definitions and theorems.
- variable {n : ℕ}: Work with an n×n matrix indexed by Fin n.
- open BigOperators Finset: Enables notation for big products/sums and Finset utilities.
- def perm := Equiv.Perm (Fin n): A permutation of {0, …, n−1}.
- def term_abs (A ... ℝ) (σ : perm) : ℝ := abs (∏ i : Fin n, A i (σ.toFun i)): For a real matrix A and a permutation σ, define the absolute value of the determinant term corresponding to σ as the absolute value of the product of the selected entries A_{i,σ(i)} (note: absolute value after multiplying, which equals product of absolute values in ℝ, and also equals the absolute value of the signed Leibniz term since |sgn σ|=1).
- def perm_set_of (S : Finset (Fin n × Fin n)) : Finset perm := (Finset.univ : Finset perm).filter fun σ => ∀ i, (i, σ i) ∈ S: The set of permutations whose associated n entries all lie in the subset S of matrix positions; i.e., terms that use only entries from S.
- def sum_terms (A ...) (P : Finset perm) : ℝ := P.sum (fun σ => term_abs A σ): Sum of the absolute values of determinant terms over a finite set of permutations P.
- theorem combinatorial_det_lemma ... (h : (∃ i j1 j2, j1 ≠ j2 ∧ (i, j1) ∈ S ∧ (i, j2) ∈ S) ∨ (∃ j i1 i2, i1 ≠ i2 ∧ (i1, j) ∈ S ∧ (i2, j) ∈ S)) : ∃ s ∈ S, sum_terms A (perm_set_of S) ≤ sum_terms A (perm_set_of (S.erase s)) := ...: If S contains two entries in the same row (exist i, distinct columns j1≠j2 in S) or two entries in the same column (exist j, distinct rows i1≠i2 in S), then there exists an s ∈ S such that the sum of absolute values over all determinant terms using only entries in S is ≤ the corresponding sum over terms using only entries in S with s removed. Proof omitted, intended as a combinatorial/matching argument.
- theorem det_multilinear_in_row ...: Define set_row r as the matrix obtained by replacing row i of A with r; then det with row i equal to c1*r1 + c2*r2 equals c1 times det with row i=r1 plus c2 times det with row i=r2. This encodes linearity of the determinant in a fixed row, with other rows held constant. Proof omitted, intended to follow from the combinatorial lemma by expanding along permutations.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural-language lemma: Given S ⊆ entries of an n×n matrix A, if S contains two entries from the same row or contains two entries from the same column, then the sum of absolute values of all determinant terms that contain only entries from S is ≤ the sum of absolute values of all determinant terms that contain only entries from S except for one of them. The code formalizes exactly this: it encodes “uses only entries from S” via perm_set_of S, sums absolute values via sum_terms, and quantifies that there exists s ∈ S so that replacing S by S \ {s} yields a (weakly) larger sum. The row/column hypothesis is stated via explicit existential quantifiers for two distinct entries sharing a row or column. This matches the intended reading of the English statement (the word “always” in the prose is naturally interpreted as “in the present S there exist two entries sharing a row or a column”). The use of ℝ matches the “absolute value” context and is a reasonable specialization.
- The second part: “Use this to prove that the determinant is a multilinear function in the rows of the matrix (linear in each row separately while fixing the other rows).” The code states linearity in a fixed row i, for arbitrary i, with other rows fixed via set_row. This is exactly the row-wise linearity property; since i is arbitrary, this gives linearity in each row separately.

Step 3: Final comparison and check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous placeholders: All auxiliary definitions are meaningful, using Mathlib constructs. There are sorries in the proofs, but the task is to check the statement/translation, not to supply proofs.
- The determinant “terms” in the natural language include the sign, but since we take absolute values, the sign is immaterial; the Lean definition uses abs of the unsigned product, which equals the abs of the signed term. So that matches.
- The phrase “contain the entries in S except for one of them” is modeled as “use only entries from S \ {s}” for some s, which aligns with the intended meaning. The code’s existence quantifier on s matches the English “except for one of them”.
- Specialization to ℝ is a mild specialization consistent with the absolute value context and is acceptable.
- The second theorem expresses exactly linearity in a single row while holding others fixed, which is the requested “multilinear in rows” property.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with appropriate definitions and theorem statements. No cheating/vacuous definitions are present. Minor specializations are acceptable.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- The docstring: States the intended content: a map between subtypes of metric spaces is continuous iff it satisfies the usual ε-δ condition on the subtypes.
- `theorem continuous_subtype_iff_metric {α : Type*} {β : Type*} [MetricSpace α] [MetricSpace β] {s : Set α} {t : Set β} (f : s → t) : ...`: Consider metric spaces α and β, subsets s ⊆ α and t ⊆ β, and a function f from s to t (i.e., between the subtypes with the induced structures).
- `Continuous f ↔ ...`: The function f is continuous (with respect to the subspace topologies/metrics on s and t) if and only if
- `∀ x : s, ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ δ > (0 : ℝ), ∀ y : s, dist (y : α) (x : α) < δ → dist (f y : β) (f x : β) < ε`: for every point x in s and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all y in s, if the ambient distance in α between y and x is < δ then the ambient distance in β between f y and f x is < ε. The coercions `(y : α)` and `(f y : β)` indicate we measure distances using the ambient metrics, which coincide with the subtype metrics.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; this does not affect the statement’s meaning.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement concerns subsets X ⊆ ℝ^m and Y ⊆ ℝ^n (Euclidean spaces) with subspace topologies, and asserts that topological continuity is equivalent to ε-δ continuity.
- The Lean statement is slightly more general: it applies to arbitrary metric spaces α, β (not just Euclidean), and to subsets s, t with the induced metrics/topologies. This is a standard and faithful generalization; in particular, it fully covers the Euclidean case.
- The ε-δ condition is stated precisely in the expected form for subspaces: quantifying over points in s and measuring distances via the ambient metrics (which define the subtype metrics). This matches the usual ε-δ definition for functions defined on subsets of metric spaces.
- The topological notion `Continuous f` is the standard notion of continuity (preimages of opens are open) in Lean’s topology, matching the natural language statement.

3) Final check:
- Are the two problems the same? The Lean theorem is a slight generalization (metric spaces rather than Euclidean spaces), but it is mathematically the same statement in the intended context and implies the original claim. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions at all. Thus the translation is legitimate and faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open ...` are standard imports/opennings; they don't affect the statement.
- The theorem header introduces a map `f : X → Y` with `X` and `Y` topological spaces, assumes `Y` is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), and assumes `f` is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`).
- The statement `IsProperMap f ↔ (∀ y, IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})) ∧ IsClosedMap f` translates to: `f` is a proper map if and only if (a) for all `y : Y`, the fiber `f^{-1}({y})` is compact, and (b) `f` is a closed map.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: Let `f : X → Y` be continuous and `Y` Hausdorff. Prove that `f` is proper iff every fiber is compact and `f` is a closed map.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes continuity and `T2Space Y` (Hausdorff), and states the equivalence between `IsProperMap f` and the conjunction of compactness of all fibers and `IsClosedMap f`.
- The names used are standard Mathlib notions: `IsProperMap`, `IsCompact`, `IsClosedMap`, `Continuous`, `T2Space`.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the proof is left as `by sorry`, which is acceptable for a translation task.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. The Lean code captures exactly the continuous and Hausdorff assumptions and the equivalence between properness and the two conditions (compact fibers and closed map). No discrepancies in quantifiers or properties.
- Minor cosmetic mismatch in theorem name vs. the docstring's suggested name is irrelevant to mathematical faithfulness.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  - `(p : ℝ → Y)`: a continuous map from ℝ to Y.

  - Conclusion: `Nonempty (Y ≃ₜ ℝ) ∨ Nonempty (Y ≃ₜ Circle)`: Y is homeomorphic to ℝ or to the circle (S¹), expressed as existence of a homeomorphism to either ℝ or `Circle`.
  - The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Prove that the only topological spaces with ℝ as a covering space are ℝ and S¹.” This means: if there exists a covering map from ℝ onto Y, then Y is homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹.
- Lean theorem: Exactly asserts that for any Y and covering map p : ℝ → Y, Y is homeomorphic to ℝ or Circle. `Circle` in Mathlib represents S¹. Therefore, the Lean statement precisely matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences or issues:
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; `IsCoveringMap` and `Circle` are standard in Mathlib.
- The theorem is stated at the correct level of generality and matches the intended meaning. No extra hypotheses (like connectedness) are assumed explicitly, but they are not needed in the statement; in fact, with `IsCoveringMap p`, surjectivity is standard, and the image of ℝ is connected, so Y will be connected as needed implicitly. This implicit detail does not alter the faithfulness of the translation.
- Using `Nonempty (Y ≃ₜ ...)` is the customary Lean way to state “Y is homeomorphic to ...”.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

  Natural language: Let X and Y be topological spaces and f : X → Y a function. If f is a local homeomorphism (IsLocalHomeomorph f), and f is proper (IsProperMap f), and Y is connected (IsConnected Y), then f is a covering map (IsCoveringMap f).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that every proper local diffeomorphism f : P → Q between manifolds without boundary, with Q connected, is a covering map.""
- Lean code: states the analogous result in the purely topological setting: a proper local homeomorphism with connected target is a covering map.
- Relationship: A local diffeomorphism between smooth manifolds (without boundary) is in particular a local homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces, and properness is a topological property of the underlying map. Thus the Lean statement is a generalization of the original: it applies to any topological spaces, not just manifolds, and it assumes only local homeomorphism (weaker than local diffeomorphism). Therefore, the code's theorem implies the original statement.

3) Final comparison:
- Hypotheses:
  - Manifolds without boundary vs arbitrary topological spaces: the Lean statement is more general.
  - Local diffeomorphism vs local homeomorphism: Lean uses a weaker hypothesis, hence more general.
  - Proper map and connected target: both match conceptually (Lean uses IsProperMap f and IsConnected Y).
- Conclusion: Both conclude that f is a covering map.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all predicates (IsLocalHomeomorph, IsProperMap, IsConnected, IsCoveringMap) are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful (indeed slightly more general) formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any point a in ℝ × ℝ and any real number r with r > 0, there exists a homeomorphism between ℝ × ℝ (the plane, with its usual topology) and the open ball centered at a with radius r, namely the set {x ∈ ℝ × ℝ | dist x a < r}.
  Here, ≃ₜ denotes a homeomorphism, and Nonempty indicates existence of such a homeomorphism.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement says: “Prove that the Euclidean plane ℝ^2 is homeomorphic to any open ball in ℝ^2.”
- The Lean theorem quantifies over an arbitrary center a and radius r > 0, and asserts existence of a homeomorphism between ℝ^2 and the open ball {x | dist x a < r}. This is exactly the content of the natural language statement.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- The code uses ℝ × ℝ with its standard metric/topology from Mathlib; the set {x | dist x a < r} is the open ball for that metric. While in Mathlib the default metric on ℝ × ℝ corresponds to the product/sup norm rather than the Euclidean 2-norm, both induce the usual Euclidean topology on ℝ^2.

- The docstring states: For a topological space X and subsets A, B of X, prove closure(A) \ closure(B) ⊆ closure(A \ B).
- `theorem diff_closure_subset_closure_diff {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] (A B : Set X) : closure A \ closure B ⊆ closure (A \ B) := by sorry`
  translates to: For any topological space X and any subsets A, B of X, we have closure(A) minus closure(B) is a subset of closure(A minus B). Here `\` is set difference in Lean (A \ B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B}) and `closure` is the topological closure.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: both assert \overline{A} − \overline{B} ⊆ \overline{A − B} for A, B ⊆ X in a topological space X.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The presence of `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but per the task, we only check the translation of the statement, not the proof. The theorem statement is precise and faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Natural language uses A − B for set difference; Lean uses `A \ B`, which is the same.
- The quantification and context (topological space X, subsets A, B) match exactly.
- No generalization or restriction beyond the original statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We fix a type X with a TopologicalSpace structure. We have points p q r s t u : X and paths x : Path p q, y : Path r s, z : Path t u.
- The theorem statement: (q = r ∧ s = t) ↔ (s = t ∧ q = r). This is the commutativity of conjunction specialized to the endpoint equalities of the three paths.

2) Match to the natural language statement:
- In topology, the concatenation of paths x : Path p q and y : Path r s is defined iff q = r. Consequently, (x*y)*z is defined iff both x*y is defined (q = r) and (x*y).end = z.start (s = t), i.e., iff (q = r ∧ s = t).
- Similarly, y*z is defined iff s = t, and then x*(y*z) is defined iff also q = r, i.e., iff (s = t ∧ q = r).
- Therefore, “(x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined” translates exactly to (q = r ∧ s = t) ↔ (s = t ∧ q = r), which is precisely the Lean theorem statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not explicitly mention concatenation or a ‘defined’ predicate, but it captures the exact necessary and sufficient endpoint equalities for those concatenations to be defined. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The objects x, y, z are genuine Mathlib Paths with endpoints p,q,r,s,t,u.
- This is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim, phrased as an equivalence of the endpoint equalities that characterize the definedness of (x*y)*z and x*(y*z).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is essentially the same as the natural language statement and is faithful.

  Natural language: For topological spaces X and Y and a function f: X → Y, if f is continuous, injective, and a closed map (images of closed sets are closed), then there exists a homeomorphism between X and the range of f. This exactly asserts that f is a homeomorphism onto its image under those hypotheses. However, the body is `by sorry`, so this is an unproven/placeholder definition.
- Second declaration:

  Natural language: If Y is Hausdorff and locally compact, and f: X → Y is continuous, injective, and proper (in Mathlib, `IsProperMap f`), then there is a homeomorphism between X and the range of f. Again, the body is `by sorry`.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- Original statement: Let Y be locally compact Hausdorff. Prove any closed injection f: X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image. In particular, any proper injection f: X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image.
- Comparison:
  • The first Lean statement assumes f is continuous, injective, and closed, and concludes a homeomorphism onto its image without any assumptions about Y. This is a standard (and more general) sufficient condition; it is a slight generalization compared to the original (which assumes Y is LCH but does not explicitly list continuity). If the intended meaning of “closed injection” includes continuity (as is common in topology contexts where “map” often implies continuity), then this matches the first part and is even stronger (no LCH needed). If not, the Lean statement adds continuity as an extra hypothesis.
  • The second Lean statement exactly captures the “in particular” clause, assuming Y is Hausdorff and locally compact and f is continuous, injective, and proper; in Mathlib, proper maps are taken as a property of a (continuous) map, so supplying `hf_cont` separately is at worst redundant. This matches the intended “in particular” conclusion.

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- Major issue: Both declarations are defined using `by sorry`. Per the auditing guidelines, any use of `sorry` or vacuous placeholders causes the translation to fail, regardless of whether the statements match conceptually.
- Hypotheses mismatch (minor): The natural language’s first part explicitly mentions Y is locally compact Hausdorff but does not explicitly assume continuity of f; the code’s first lemma drops the LCH assumption but requires continuity. Depending on conventions, this may be acceptable (slight generalization) if continuity is implicit. The second part aligns well with the “in particular” clause.
- No other auxiliary fake definitions; all Mathlib concepts (`IsClosedMap`, `IsProperMap`, `Continuous`, `Injective`, `T2Space`, `LocallyCompactSpace`, `X ≃ₜ Set.range f`) are legitimate.

Conclusion: Because both results are given with `sorry`, the translation fails per the guidelines. If the `sorry` blocks were replaced by actual proofs, the statements would be essentially faithful (with a mild generalization/added explicit continuity in the first lemma).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Load mathlib.
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: Work with a type X equipped only with a topological space structure (not a metric space).
- `open Set`: Open the Set namespace.
- `variable (gamma_invariant : Set X → Prop)`: Introduce an arbitrary predicate on sets of X, intended to represent ""Γ-invariance"", but not tied to any group action or isometries.
- `def any_two_points_in_disjoint_gamma_invariant_open_sets : Prop := ...`: Define the condition that for all x y in X, there exist open sets U and V with x ∈ U, y ∈ V, U and V disjoint, and both U and V satisfy `gamma_invariant`. This matches the verbal condition ""Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets"" except that Γ-invariance is abstracted as an arbitrary predicate.
- `def other_equivalent_conditions : Prop := True`: Declare a placeholder proposition for the ""other equivalent conditions"", but set it equal to True. This is a vacuous placeholder and not a faithful formalization of the other conditions.
- `theorem any_two_points_in_disjoint_gamma_invariant_open_sets_equiv_others : ... ↔ other_equivalent_conditions := by sorry`: State that the above condition is equivalent to `other_equivalent_conditions` (which is True), with proof omitted. Thus the statement claims an equivalence with True, i.e., that the condition holds unconditionally, which is not what the natural language statement asserts.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language setup assumes a metric space X and a group action by isometries Γ. The code only assumes a TopologicalSpace and does not formalize a group, a group action, or isometries. The intended Γ-invariance is represented by an arbitrary predicate `gamma_invariant` without any link to a group action. This omits essential context.
- The key condition ""Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets"" is captured structurally by `any_two_points_in_disjoint_gamma_invariant_open_sets` (with `gamma_invariant` standing for invariance), which is fine as an isolated condition.
- However, the statement that this condition is ""equivalent to the others"" is replaced by an equivalence with `True`. This is a vacuous placeholder and drastically changes the meaning: it asserts the condition is equivalent to True (i.e., always holds), which is not what the original statement says. Moreover, `other_equivalent_conditions` being defined as `True` is explicitly a vacuous, non-faithful placeholder according to the guidelines.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different. The code fails to include the metric space and group action by isometries. More importantly, it replaces the ""other equivalent conditions"" with `True`, making the equivalence claim meaningless and incorrect relative to the original. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Given the vacuous placeholder and missing core structures, even if the placeholder were removed, substantial context (group, action, isometries, and the actual ""other equivalent conditions"") is absent. Hence it does not pass the fidelity test.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but no specific manifold or smoothness machinery is used.
- theorem exists_smooth_map_homotopic {M N : Type*} [TopologicalSpace M] [TopologicalSpace N] (f : M → N) (continuous_f : Continuous f) (SmoothStructure : Prop) (IsSmooth : (M → N) → Prop) (Homotopic : (M → N) → (M → N) → Prop) : ∃ g : M → N, IsSmooth g ∧ Homotopic f g := by sorry
  Natural language: For any types M and N with topologies, a continuous map f : M → N, an arbitrary proposition SmoothStructure (intended as a placeholder for “M and N carry smooth structures”), and arbitrary predicates IsSmooth on functions and Homotopic on pairs of functions, there exists a map g : M → N such that IsSmooth g and Homotopic f g.

Assessment of each piece:
- M, N are only TopologicalSpace instances, not smooth manifolds. The code introduces a generic Prop named SmoothStructure, but it is completely unconstrained and not tied to M and N, nor used in the conclusion in any meaningful way.
- IsSmooth and Homotopic are taken as arbitrary predicates, not the Mathlib notions (e.g., smooth maps relative to a manifold structure, and continuous homotopies). This makes the statement absurdly general: it claims existence of g for any chosen predicates.
- The theorem statement therefore does not formalize the concrete mathematical content; it abstracts away the essential definitions as parameters rather than invoking the real Mathlib ones.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original: Let M and N be smooth manifolds, and f ∈ C^0(M, N). Show there exists a smooth map g : M → N homotopic to f.
- Code: For topological spaces M and N, continuous f, and arbitrary predicates IsSmooth and Homotopic, there exists g with IsSmooth g and Homotopic f g. It also includes a placeholder hypothesis SmoothStructure : Prop, but it is not connected to the structures on M and N and not used to define IsSmooth or Homotopic.

Differences:
- Missing proper manifold structures: The code does not assert or use that M and N are smooth manifolds. SmoothStructure : Prop is a vacuous placeholder, not a Mathlib structure (e.g., ChartedSpace, SmoothManifoldWithCorners).
- Wrong/absent definitions: IsSmooth and Homotopic are arbitrary predicates, not the standard Mathlib definitions of smoothness and homotopy. This is a major deviation.
- Over-general quantification: The theorem quantifies over any IsSmooth and Homotopic, making the claim far stronger (and meaningless) than the original. The existence claim would be false for perverse choices (e.g., IsSmooth ≡ False), which highlights the statement is not the intended one.
- Not using Mathlib's manifold framework at all, contrary to the requirement to use applicable Mathlib terms.

Conclusion:
- The code is not a faithful translation. It uses vacuous placeholders and abstracts away the essential mathematical content. While one could ""fix"" it by replacing SmoothStructure with actual manifold structures and IsSmooth/Homotopic with the Mathlib notions, as written it fails the fidelity test.

Grade justification:
- Vacuous placeholders and arbitrary predicates make the current statement unfaithful. However, if these were replaced with actual Mathlib definitions (manifold structures, smoothness, homotopy), the final theorem would match the intended statement. This aligns with the rubric’s ""makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, the final theorem is faithful"" → around 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem benmckay_top_continuity_438 is stated for types X and Y, a function f : X → Y, with X equipped with a MetricSpace structure, and f surjective.
- It defines topX to be the topology on X obtained from its metric, via the standard chain MetricSpace → PseudoMetricSpace → UniformSpace → TopologicalSpace. This is just the usual topology of X.
- The conclusion asserts: there exists a PseudoMetricSpace structure m on Y such that the topology induced by m (again via PseudoMetricSpace → UniformSpace → TopologicalSpace) is equal to the coinduced (final/quotient) topology on Y via f from topX. In words: Y admits a pseudometric whose induced topology equals the quotient topology induced by f.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), but we only audit the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let f: X → Y be surjective, X a metric space. Prove that the quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric on Y.""
- Lean: ""There exists a pseudometric on Y whose induced topology equals the coinduced (‘quotient’) topology from f.""
- Agreement:
  - Uses surjectivity of f.
  - Treats X as a metric space and uses the usual topology on X.
  - Targets the coinduced (quotient) topology on Y.
  - Asserts existence of a distance-like structure on Y inducing exactly that topology.
- Discrepancy:
  - The natural statement claims a metric on Y (implies T2/Hausdorff, T1), whereas the Lean statement only asserts a pseudometric. This is a strict weakening: a pseudometric can identify distinct points at zero distance and can induce a non-Hausdorff topology, which can match the general quotient topology. In general, the natural statement is false without extra conditions; the Lean statement reflects the correct general result.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are different in an essential way: metric vs pseudometric. The Lean code proves (or rather states) pseudometrizability of the quotient topology, not metrizability. Everything else (surjectivity, coinduced topology) matches. No vacuous placeholders are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib constructions. But the key claim in the natural statement (metric) is stronger than the Lean code (pseudometric), so the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- No fake definitions; the statement is mathematically meaningful and close in spirit but strictly weaker than the original. Because the distinction is substantial, the translation is not faithful. Assigning a 7 to reflect a significant but not minor mismatch.

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- import Mathlib: Uses standard Mathlib; good.
- Theorem covering.fiber_cardinal_eq_of_path: For types E and X with topologies, a map p : E → X that is a covering map (IsCoveringMap p), and any path γ from x0 to x1 in X, the cardinality of the fiber p⁻¹{x0} equals the cardinality of p⁻¹{x1}. This is formalized as Cardinal.mk { e : E // p e = x0 } = Cardinal.mk { e : E // p e = x1 }.
  Assessment: This expresses that the number of preimages (sheets/fiber size) is constant along a path, i.e., endpoints have equal fiber cardinalities. It uses standard Mathlib notions: IsCoveringMap, Path, and Cardinal.mk of a subtype.
- Theorem covering.fiber_cardinal_const_of_path_connected: If X is path connected (IsPathConnected (Set.univ : Set X)), then there exists a cardinal n such that for every x : X, the fiber cardinality |p⁻¹{x}| equals n. Formalized as ∃ n : Cardinal, ∀ x, Cardinal.mk { e : E // p e = x } = n.
  Assessment: This is precisely the statement that in a path-connected base space, a covering map is n-to-1 for some (possibly infinite) cardinal n. Cardinal allows infinite sizes, matching the “possibly ∞” clause.
No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; all notions (IsCoveringMap, Path, IsPathConnected, Cardinal.mk) are standard in Mathlib. Proofs are omitted, which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Overall faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The first Lean theorem captures “constancy along any path” by equating fiber cardinalities at the endpoints of any path. In the classical phrasing, the number of sheets over evenly covered neighborhoods is locally constant and hence constant along paths; equivalently, fiber sizes are constant along paths. The Lean statement directly formulates this equivalence via fibers, which is mathematically faithful.
- The second Lean theorem matches the “in particular” clause: if the base is path connected, then there exists a single cardinal n such that every fiber has size n, i.e., the covering is n-to-1. The use of Cardinal handles the “might be ∞” part.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language mentions “number of sheets above an evenly covered open set,” whereas the Lean statements refer directly to fiber cardinalities. In covering space theory, on an evenly covered open set U, the number of sheets equals the cardinality of each fiber over points of U. Thus the Lean formulation is an equivalent and standard formalization and not a substantive departure.
- The Lean code does not explicitly mention evenly covered sets, but this is not a discrepancy; it uses the core property of covering maps that implies the stated constancy.
- The domain names (Y vs X) differ only by notation.
Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- The Lean statement exactly captures the universal property: the existence and uniqueness of a group homomorphism φ: FreeGroup S →* G extending f on generators (φ ∘ FreeGroup.of = f). The phrase ""extending linearly to all words"" is informal; the formal universal property ensures the unique multiplicative/group-theoretic extension to all words. Mathlib’s `FreeGroup.of` and `→*` are the standard constructs for this.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. Both assert the universal property of the free group: for any function from generators to a group, there is a unique group homomorphism from the free group sending each generator to its image under f. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the code relies on standard Mathlib definitions. The minor wording ""linearly"" in the natural language is informal and does not introduce a different mathematical requirement.

- The objects pi1, tildeX, deck_group are arbitrary and not identified with π1(X), the universal cover of X, or the deck transformation group. There is no covering map or universal cover structure anywhere.
- deck_action and concat_left are arbitrary constants, not actual deck transformations or concatenation actions, and not even required to be group actions.
- The theorem asserts the existence of an isomorphism between arbitrary groups making two arbitrary functions commute, which is not connected to the topological content.
- The basepoint x0 is declared but unused.

Step 3: Final check: Same or different?
They are different. The Lean statement is an abstract existence claim about an isomorphism between two unspecified groups with two unspecified functions, with no relation to fundamental groups, universal covers, or deck transformations, and no topological hypotheses. It uses vacuous placeholders (constants) instead of Mathlib definitions and does not formalize the intended mathematical structures or conditions. Even though the shape of the conclusion (an isomorphism intertwining actions) resembles the natural result, the lack of any linkage to X and to covering space structures makes it unfaithful.

Assessment per guidelines
- Vacuous placeholders are used for key notions (deck action, concatenation action). The central objects (π1, deck group, universal cover) are not connected to X.
- If these placeholders were replaced by the actual Mathlib definitions and the proper hypotheses on X and a universal cover were added, the target theorem would indeed match the intended statement. Thus, while unfaithful as written, the overall form suggests a plausible direction if the missing structure were filled in.

Grade rationale
Because the code uses vacuous placeholders and omits all necessary structural connections and hypotheses, it fails the faithfulness test. However, the final theorem’s shape (an iso intertwining actions) is what one would ultimately want, so if the placeholders were properly replaced, the statement could be faithful. This matches the rubric’s description for a 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace X]`: X is a type equipped with a pseudometric space structure (slightly more general than a metric space).
- `variable {Γ : Type*} [Monoid Γ] [MulAction Γ X]`: Γ is a monoid acting on X.

- `def covering_action : Prop := ∀ x : X, ∃ U : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ (∀ (γ γ' : Γ), γ ≠ γ' → Disjoint (γ • U) (γ' • U))`
  Natural language: The action is a covering action if for every point x in X there exists an open neighborhood U of x such that the family of translates {γ • U | γ ∈ Γ} is pairwise disjoint (i.e., for any distinct γ, γ', the sets γ•U and γ'•U are disjoint).

- `def action_free : Prop := ∀ γ : Γ, (∀ x : X, γ • x = x) → γ = 1`
  Natural language: The action is ""free"" if the only element of Γ that fixes every point of X is the identity. Note: this is strictly weaker than the standard definition of a free action (which requires that if γ fixes some point, then γ = 1; equivalently, all stabilizers are trivial). This definition only forbids a nontrivial element fixing all points, not fixing a single point.

- `def discrete_orbits : Prop := ∀ x : X, ∃ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε ∧ (Metric.ball x ε ∩ {y | ∃ γ : Γ, y = γ • x}) = {x}`
  Natural language: The orbits are discrete in the metric sense: for each x, there exists ε > 0 such that the ε-ball around x intersects the orbit of x only at x.

- `theorem covering_action_iff_free_and_discrete (h_isometry : ∀ γ : Γ, Isometry (fun x => γ • x)) : covering_action ↔ action_free ∧ discrete_orbits := by sorry`
  Natural language: Assuming each action map x ↦ γ•x is an isometry, the action is a covering action if and only if (the action is ""free"" in the above sense) and the orbits are discrete. Proof omitted.

2) Comparison with the original statement:
- Original: X is a metric space; code: X is a pseudometric space. This is a slight generalization and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- Original: Γ acts by isometries; code: assumes ∀ γ, the action map is an isometry. This matches the hypothesis.
- Original: ""acts on X as a covering action""; code: formalizes covering action as the existence, for each x, of an open U with pairwise disjoint translates. This is a common formalization; acceptable.
- Original: ""free with discrete orbits""; code: defines discrete_orbits correctly in a standard metric sense. However, the definition of ""free"" is incorrect: it only requires that the only element fixing every point is the identity, which is much weaker than the standard notion of a free action (trivial stabilizers at every point). Thus the theorem statement in code is not equivalent to the natural language statement.
- Additional minor mismatch: Γ is a monoid in the code rather than a group. This generalization may be acceptable, but in combination with the incorrect definition of freeness, the statement diverges meaningfully from the original.

3) Final check:
The central mismatch is the definition of action_free. The original requires: ∀ γ ≠ 1, ∀ x, γ•x ≠ x (or equivalently, if γ•x = x for some x then γ = 1). The code requires only: if γ fixes every x, then γ = 1. These are not equivalent. Therefore the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the original theorem, despite other parts being reasonably aligned.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholders; most notions are close, but the key property (free action) is incorrectly encoded, which invalidates the core equivalence. This is a significant error, so a low-to-mid score is appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def Rn (n : ℕ) := Fin n → ℝ`: Defines Euclidean n-space as n-tuples of real numbers. This is standard and fine.
- `def shortest_path ... : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate meant to state that γ is a shortest path from x to y in ℝ^n \ S, but it is defined to be always true. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not capture the intended meaning at all.
- `def polygon_with_corners_on ... : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate meant to mean “γ is a polygon whose corners lie in S,” but again it is defined to be always true. Another vacuous placeholder.
- The theorem `shortest_path_in_Rn_minus_S_is_polygon` assumes `hγ : shortest_path n S x y γ` and `hS : ∀ t, γ t ∉ S` and concludes `polygon_with_corners_on n S γ`, with `by sorry` as the proof. Since the predicates are both defined as True, the statement is vacuous. The presence of `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; but more critically, the notions are not defined at all.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The intended statement: For S ⊂ ℝ^n, the shortest path from x to y in ℝ^n \ S is a polygon with corners on S (whenever this makes sense). To formalize this, one needs: a precise notion of path γ from x to y, a metric/length structure in ℝ^n, a definition of “shortest path” (minimizer of length among admissible paths staying in ℝ^n \ S), and a definition of “polygon with corners on S” (piecewise-linear path whose vertices lie on S). The code does not define any of these; both critical predicates are replaced by `True`. Thus the theorem is entirely vacuous and does not faithfully represent the content.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The Lean code uses vacuous predicates for both “shortest path” and “polygon with corners on S,” so it does not capture any of the mathematical content.
- It does not encode endpoints (γ(0)=x, γ(1)=y), length minimization, polygonality, or corner conditions.
- The auxiliary assumption `hS : ∀ t, γ t ∉ S` partially reflects the requirement that the path stays in ℝ^n \ S, but this is redundant if “shortest_path” were properly defined, and as-is it is the only meaningful constraint present.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
Overall, the code is not a faithful translation.

Grading rationale: It makes up vacuous definitions; however, if those were properly defined, the general shape of the theorem statement would align with the natural language claim. This fits the rubric level where vacuous definitions exist but, if fixed, the final theorem would be faithful.

The proof term is omitted (by sorry), but the statement exactly asserts the desired isomorphism.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: π1(X×Y, (x0, y0)) ≅ π1(X, x0) × π1(Y, y0).
- The Lean statement asserts a multiplicative group isomorphism (≃*) between FundamentalGroup (X × Y) (x0, y0) and FundamentalGroup X x0 × FundamentalGroup Y y0.
- This precisely matches the mathematical content. Using ≃* captures group isomorphism, and the right-hand side uses the cartesian product which, with group instances, is the product group.
- No extraneous assumptions are imposed; only [TopologicalSpace X] and [TopologicalSpace Y], which are necessary.
- There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; FundamentalGroup is from Mathlib. The use of sorry is only for the proof, which is acceptable per the instructions.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts: If X → Y and Y → Z are covering maps (in the genuine topological sense), then X → Z is also a covering map. In the Lean code, the predicate for being a covering map is defined as `True`, i.e., every map is a covering map. Thus the theorem becomes the trivial statement True → True → True, entirely vacuous with respect to covering maps. Therefore, the code does not faithfully formalize the intended mathematical content.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The original requires the genuine notion of covering map and proves closure under composition. The Lean code uses a vacuous predicate (`True`) for covering maps, so the theorem is automatically true for any functions and does not capture the concept at all. Even though the theorem statement shape matches (composition preserves the predicate), the predicate itself is not faithful. Also, the proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the main failure is the vacuous definition.

Given that replacing `MyIsCoveringMap` with a legitimate covering map predicate would make the theorem statement faithful, this falls under ""makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful.""

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `def is_universal_covering_map {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : X → Y) : Prop := True`
  This introduces a predicate named “is_universal_covering_map” on a map p : X → Y between topological spaces, but it is defined to be True for all maps. So in this file, every map is (trivially) a universal covering map. This is a placeholder, not a faithful definition.

- `theorem universal_cover_unique_up_to_iso {X Y Z : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z] (p : X → Y) (q : Z → Y) (hp : is_universal_covering_map p) (hq : is_universal_covering_map q) : ∃! (f : X → Z), q ∘ f = p := by sorry`
  This states: given maps p : X → Y and q : Z → Y between topological spaces, and assuming both are universal covering maps (under the placeholder predicate), there exists a unique function f : X → Z such that q ∘ f = p. No continuity or homeomorphism structure is required for f; it is just a bare function. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but our task is about the statement, not the proof.

Step 2: Comparison to the natural language statement
Natural language: “Suppose that X → Y and Z → Y are universal covering maps. Prove that X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y, i.e. there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle commute.”
- The code’s theorem asserts the existence and uniqueness of a function f : X → Z with q ∘ f = p, under the hypothesis that p and q are universal covering maps. This matches the “i.e.” clause (unique map making the triangle commute) at the level of raw functions.
- However, the code uses a vacuous placeholder for “is_universal_covering_map” (it’s always True), so it does not faithfully encode the hypothesis that p and q are universal covering maps. This is a major discrepancy per the guidelines.
- Additionally, the statement speaks about being “isomorphic as a covering of Y,” which in topology typically means a homeomorphism h : X ≃ₜ Z over Y (i.e., q ∘ h = p), or equivalently unique isomorphisms in the category of coverings over Y. The code only asserts a unique function, not continuity or homeomorphism, and does not provide the inverse map or isomorphism structure.
- The natural language includes an “i.e.” that equates “isomorphic as a covering of Y” with “there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle commute.” If we take that equivalence as the intended target, the theorem shape aligns with that clause, but still lacks continuity/homeomorphism. In any case, the placeholder predicate remains a fatal issue for faithfulness.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  1) The core hypothesis (universal covering map) is replaced by a vacuous predicate `True`. This makes the statement not genuinely about universal covering maps.
  2) The conclusion in the code is about a unique bare function, without continuity, not an isomorphism/homeomorphism of coverings. The natural language suggests isomorphism as coverings, though it restates it as uniqueness of a map. Even accepting the restatement, the code drops continuity/homeomorphism.
  3) No additional structure (like uniqueness in both directions or homeomorphism equivalence) is asserted.

Conclusion: Because of the vacuous placeholder for universal covering maps and the lack of topological/covering structure on the map, the Lean statement is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. If the placeholder were replaced by a real definition and continuity/homeomorphism over Y were required, the shape would be appropriate. As is, it fails per the guidelines.

- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.

- `variable [tX : TopologicalSpace X]`: Assume X has a topology tX.
- `local instance : TopologicalSpace Y := TopologicalSpace.coinduced f tX`: Equip Y, locally in this section, with the coinduced (final/quotient) topology via f from the topology on X. This matches “Equip Y with the quotient topology induced by f”.

    (hK : IsCompact K) (hKf : f '' K = (univ : Set Y)) : CompactSpace Y := by sorry`
  Natural language: If f is surjective, K ⊆ X is compact, and f(K) = Y (expressed as f '' K = univ), then Y is a compact space under the coinduced topology. `CompactSpace Y` is the typeclass formulation of “Y is compact.” The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: “Let f : X → Y be a surjective map. Suppose there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Equip Y with the quotient topology induced by f. Prove that Y is compact.”
- Lean code sets Y’s topology to the coinduced (final/quotient) topology from f, precisely as requested.
- It assumes f is surjective (hf), K is compact (hK), and f(K) = Y (hKf as f '' K = univ). This matches the hypotheses. Note: hKf already implies surjectivity, so hf is redundant but consistent with the statement’s explicit assumption.
- Conclusion is `CompactSpace Y`, i.e., Y is compact in this topology.
- Quantification: The Lean theorem is stated with K as a parameter; this is the standard way to formalize the existential hypothesis (given a witness K with the properties, conclude compactness). It is faithful to “there exists K …” since one can supply the existing K as an argument.

Auxiliary definitions and red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all constructs are standard Mathlib.
- The local instance correctly sets Y’s topology for the theorem’s context.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches exactly. Minor redundancy (explicit surjectivity alongside f '' K = univ) does not change meaning. The code is a faithful translation.

- Context and instances: X is a metric space, Γ is a group acting on X, and [IsIsometricSMul Γ X] says the action is by isometries. This matches “a group of isometries acting on a metric space”.
- free_action : Prop := ∀ g x, g • x = x → g = 1. This encodes freeness of the action: only the identity can fix a point.
- discrete_orbits : Prop := ∀ x, ∃ ε > 0, ∀ g, g ≠ 1 → dist (g • x) x ≥ ε. This says at each x there is a positive lower bound on distances to its nontrivial translates, which is a strong metric formulation implying that the orbit is discrete at x. This is a plausible formalization of “discrete orbits”.
- Variables (q : X → Y) (hq : ∀ x y, q x = q y ↔ ∃ g : Γ, g • x = y). This asserts q identifies precisely points in the same Γ-orbit. This is a set-theoretic characterization of the orbit quotient; however, Y is just an arbitrary type here with no topology/metric structure imposed.
- is_locally_isometric_covering_map {A B} (f : A → B) : Prop := True. This is a vacuous placeholder. It does not define “locally isometric covering map” and carries no mathematical content.
- Theorem quotient_map_is_locally_isometric_covering_map (hfree : free_action) (hdisc : discrete_orbits) : is_locally_isometric_covering_map (q : X → Y) := by sorry. Under freeness and discrete orbits, it concludes the placeholder property (which is always True) for q. The theorem does not include hq as an explicit hypothesis in its statement, but hq is a global variable in context. Nevertheless, the conclusion is vacuous due to the placeholder.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Given a free action by isometries with discrete orbits, the quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map.
- Issues:
  - The crucial target property “locally isometric covering map” is replaced by a placeholder defined as True, so the statement becomes trivially true and carries no content. This violates the requirement of a faithful translation.
  - No topological or metric structure is placed on the codomain Y, yet “locally isometric covering map” intrinsically requires topological/metric structure.
  - The codomain is not the canonical quotient X/Γ; instead, an arbitrary type Y with a set-theoretic characterization (hq) is used. That could be acceptable if the correct structures and properties were imposed, but they are not.
  - The theorem omits (in its explicit hypotheses) the property hq that q is the quotient; even though hq is a global variable, the written proposition of the theorem does not mention it, and more importantly, because the target property is True, it doesn’t matter anyway.
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s existing notions for covering maps (e.g., IsCoveringMap) or local isometries, nor the canonical quotient X ⧸ Γ. The key conclusion is not expressed using Mathlib’s real concepts.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code’s main conclusion is a vacuous predicate True, not the genuine “locally isometric covering map” property. Moreover, necessary structures on the quotient space are absent. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous placeholder for the main conclusion and missing structural content means it fails the core requirement. Even if the placeholder were replaced by a real definition, the statement would still need proper structures on Y and a real covering map notion. Thus, according to the rubric, this merits a low score.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- The theorem fundamental_group_acts_on_fiber takes: types X, Y with topologies; a map p : X → Y; three bare propositions h_covering, h_path_conn, h_loc_simply_conn (which are not used anywhere); and a basepoint y0 : Y.
- It asserts the existence of:
  - a type π1,
  - a group structure grp : Group π1,
  - a topology π1_top : TopologicalSpace π1,
  - an action act : π1 → {x : X // p x = y0} → {x : X // p x = y0},
  together with the usual group-action axioms:
  - associativity of the action: ∀ g h x, act (g * h) x = act g (act h x),
  - identity acts trivially: ∀ x, act (1 : π1) x = x,
  - and continuity of the action map π1 × fiber → fiber.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry). Also, note that grp is not installed as a typeclass instance, so the use of g * h and 1 : π1 would normally require bringing grp into instance scope; this is a potential typing issue, though the problem statement says the code compiles.

Step 2: Compare against the natural language statement.
The original statement: For every covering space p : X → Y of a path connected and locally simply connected Y (with basepoint y0), the fundamental group π1(Y, y0) acts on the fiber X_{y0} = p^{-1}(y0) by [x][y] = [x * y] (concatenation of paths), and this action is continuous.

Key features of the original:
- The specific group is π1(Y, y0), not an arbitrary group.
- The action is the standard one defined via path lifting: [x][y] = [x * y].
- Hypotheses are specific and meaningful: p is a covering map, Y is path connected and locally simply connected.
- Continuity refers to the action defined from this data (with the appropriate topologies on π1 and the fiber).

What the Lean code asserts instead:
- It introduces h_covering, h_path_conn, h_loc_simply_conn merely as bare Prop hypotheses and does not use them at all. They are placeholders with no effect on the conclusion.
- It existentially quantifies a type π1 with a group structure and a topology, and an action on the fiber, and requires the action axioms plus continuity. There is no connection to π1(Y, y0) or to loops, path concatenation, or covering spaces.
- Thus it does not claim the action is by the fundamental group, nor that it has the specific form [x][y] = [x * y]. It only claims that some group and some topology and some action exist, which is a much weaker and largely vacuous claim (e.g., one could take a trivial group with a discrete topology and a trivial action, satisfying continuity automatically), and it does not depend on p being a covering map or Y having the stated properties.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
They are different:
- The code’s statement is an existential assertion of an unspecified group action with continuity, unrelated to the fundamental group or covering space structure, and with unused hypotheses. It is far weaker than the original theorem and essentially vacuous.
- The original statement specifies the acting group (π1(Y, y0)), the action formula ([x][y] = [x*y]) arising from path concatenation, and ties it to the covering p and the topological hypotheses on Y.

Additional red flags:
- Using grp : Group π1 as a non-instance while employing notation g * h and 1 : π1 would normally not typecheck unless grp is provided as an instance (haveI := grp). Even granting compilation, this indicates a non-standard and likely erroneous formalization approach.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement. It replaces the specific, structured claim with a vacuous existence statement and ignores the essential mathematical content.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Using mathlib.
- universe u v: Universe levels.
- constant is_simply_connected : ∀ {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X], Set X → Prop: Introduces an uninterpreted predicate assigning to each subset of a topological space a proposition ""is_simply_connected"". This is a placeholder and not mathlib’s actual notion (which is SimplyConnected on a space, typically the subtype with the subspace topology).
- constant fundamental_group : ∀ (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] (x0 : X), Type v: Introduces an uninterpreted type for the fundamental group at a basepoint. This is a placeholder, not mathlib’s FundamentalGroup.
- theorem countable_fundamental_group_of_simply_connected_open_basis ... : The statement is: For a topological space X that is path connected ([PathConnectedSpace X]), and given a set B of subsets of X with the following properties:
  • hBcount: B is countable.
  • hBopen: each U ∈ B is open in X.
  • hBcover: the union of all sets in B is the whole space X.
  • hBbasis: for any U,V ∈ B and any point x ∈ U ∩ V, there exists W ∈ B with x ∈ W ⊆ U ∩ V.
  • hBsimply: each U ∈ B is simply connected (according to the placeholder predicate).
  Then for any basepoint x0 : X, the (placeholder) fundamental group fundamental_group X x0 is countable. Proof is omitted with sorry.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Let X be a path connected topological space that admits a countable basis of simply connected open sets. Show that π1(X) is countable.""
- Major issues:
  • Placeholder/vacuous definitions: The code uses completely uninterpreted constants is_simply_connected and fundamental_group. These do not faithfully capture the mathematical notions of simply connected open sets (as subspaces) and the fundamental group. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate, not vacuous placeholders.
  • Basis condition mismatch: The code assumes B is a countable collection of open sets covering X and satisfying the intersection refinement property for U,V ∈ B. While these are the axioms for a base of some topology, they do not ensure that B is a basis for the given topology on X. Missing is the key property that every open set of X is a union of elements of B (or the equivalent pointwise neighborhood condition: for each x in an open U, there exists B ∈ B with x ∈ B ⊆ U). As written, B could be too small (e.g., B = {X} in a non-indiscrete topology satisfies the given properties but is not a basis for the topology). The natural statement requires a basis for the topology of X.
  • Simply connectedness on open subsets: Even if we ignore the placeholder, the code predicates simply connectedness on sets U : Set X, but does not specify the subspace topology. Mathlib normally treats this via the subtype U with its induced topology and SimplyConnected U. The placeholder avoids this but at the cost of faithfulness.
- Scope of the conclusion: The theorem states Countable (fundamental_group X x0) for any x0, which matches the intended ""at any basepoint"" interpretation, given path connectivity. That part aligns conceptually.

3) Final check:
- The code is not a faithful translation. It relies on vacuous, uninterpreted constants for the central notions (fundamental group, simply connected), and its hypotheses on B are weaker than ""X admits a countable basis"" for its given topology. Therefore the Lean statement differs materially from the natural language statement.

Given these issues, the translation fails the faithfulness test.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code sets up a general smooth manifold context: a nontrivially normed field 𝕜, model spaces E, F with norms, model-with-corners I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H and J : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 F G, and manifolds M, N modeled on H, G respectively. A function φ : M → N is fixed.
- A parameter n : WithTop ℕ∞ is introduced (this is unusual for Mathlib; the standard differentiability index is often ℕ∞ or WithTop ℕ, not WithTop ℕ∞, which raises a red flag about whether this matches actual Mathlib conventions, but we accept the prompt's claim that it compiles).
- The only theorem stated is:
  ""theorem isOpen_set_of_isLocalDiffeomorphAt : IsOpen {x : M | IsLocalDiffeomorphAt I J n φ x} := by sorry""
  In words: The set of points x in M where φ is a local diffeomorphism (at x, with respect to I, J, and smoothness index n) is open.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Let φ : P → Q be a smooth map of manifolds with dim P = dim Q. Show there is a dense set of points p₀ ∈ P such that φ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of each such p₀. That is, the set of points where φ is a local diffeomorphism is dense in P (under the stated assumptions).

Discrepancies:
- The Lean theorem only asserts that the set of points where φ is a local diffeomorphism is open. It says nothing about density or existence of a dense subset. Openness is a much weaker and different property than density.
- The Lean statement lacks the hypothesis dim P = dim Q entirely.
- The Lean statement also does not state that φ is smooth; while the predicate IsLocalDiffeomorphAt presumably implies some regularity, the density claim in the natural language statement crucially uses the global assumption and dimension equality—none of which are present.
- The index n : WithTop ℕ∞ is nonstandard and may not match Mathlib conventions, but regardless, it does not repair the mismatch in the mathematical content: the code is about openness, not density.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced, so there is no vacuity via fake definitions; however, the main theorem is not a faithful translation of the original statement.

Final check:
- The math problems are different: ""set is open"" versus ""set is dense (under dim equality and smoothness)"". The dimension hypothesis is missing, and the conclusion is fundamentally different.

Given these issues, the translation is not faithful.

- Quantification over all subsets A, B is present via `(A B : Set X)`.
- The space X is assumed to be a topological space, as required.

  • This declares types X and Y, a function f : X → Y.
  • `tX` and `tY` are topologies on X and Y.
  • `ht : tY = TopologicalSpace.coinduced f tX` enforces that Y is endowed with the coinduced (quotient) topology from f.
  • `hf : Function.Surjective f` assumes f is surjective.

  • `hKf : f '' K = univ` states the image of K under f is all of Y.
  • The conclusion `@CompactSpace Y tY` states Y is a compact space with topology tY.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement assumes f is surjective and there exists a compact subset K with f(K)=Y, and claims Y is compact under the quotient topology induced by f. The Lean theorem takes as hypotheses exactly these conditions: surjectivity, existence of K compact with image all Y, and that tY equals the coinduced (quotient) topology from f. The conclusion is that Y is a CompactSpace with tY. This matches the intended meaning.
- While the surjectivity hypothesis is technically redundant given `f '' K = univ`, including it doesn't change the meaning and is consistent with the natural language phrasing which also mentions surjectivity explicitly.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are from mathlib and standard.
- The conclusion matches “Y is compact in the quotient topology.”
- The structure of the statement in Lean (explicitly providing tY and asserting it equals the coinduced topology) aligns precisely with “endowed with the quotient topology.”

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Suppose X and Y are topological spaces and A ⊆ X is dense. Prove that the inclusion C(Y) → C(X × Y) is an isomorphism onto the functions which are constant on each set {x} × Y with x ∈ X.”
- The code captures the characterization of the image: it asserts that the image of precomposition with the second projection equals the set of continuous maps constant on each vertical slice. This matches the “onto the functions which are constant …” part.
- However, the phrase “is an isomorphism onto” typically means a bijection between C(Y) and that subset: i.e., not only is the image equal to that subset (surjectivity onto the subset), but also the map is injective. The theorem in Lean does not state injectivity. It only states equality of the range with the subset.
- In fact, injectivity of precomposition with π₂ requires that π₂ be surjective, which fails if X is empty. The code does not assume `Nonempty X`, and it does not state injectivity. So the formal statement is strictly weaker than “isomorphism onto.”
- Regarding the dense subset A: the natural language mentions A is dense, and the code includes A and `hA : Dense A`. The docstring adds: “If A ⊆ X is dense then it suffices to check the constancy on A.” But the formal statement neither uses A nor expresses this sufficiency. So the dense-subset refinement is not actually formalized in the theorem.
- The code generalizes to an arbitrary target space Z for continuous maps. The natural statement did not specify the codomain of C(·); this generalization is reasonable and harmless.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same core image characterization: Yes, equality between the image of pullback along π₂ and the continuous maps constant on each vertical slice is captured.
- Missing injectivity: The natural statement’s “isomorphism onto” implies injectivity; the code does not assert it (nor assume `Nonempty X` to ensure it). This is a substantive difference.
- Dense subset refinement: The natural statement brings up a dense subset A; the code’s theorem includes `hA : Dense A` but does not use it, and it does not formalize the “suffices to check on A” part. Thus, part of the intended content is absent from the formal statement.

Conclusion: The code faithfully captures the image characterization but omits the injectivity/isomorphism aspect and does not encode the dense-subset sufficiency. Therefore, it is not a fully faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code imports Mathlib and then works purely in abstract group theory. It introduces four types G0, G1, H0, H1 equipped with Group structures.
- It states a theorem homotopy_naturality_groups taking:
  • x_iso : G0 ≃* G1 (an arbitrary group isomorphism),
  • y_iso : H0 ≃* H1 (another arbitrary group isomorphism),
  • f0 : G0 →* H0 (an arbitrary group homomorphism),
  • f1 : G1 →* H1 (another arbitrary group homomorphism),
  and asserts the equality of functions y_iso ∘ f0 = f1 ∘ x_iso as maps G0 → H1. The proof is omitted by sorry.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original statement is topological, involving a specific homotopy F : [0,1] × X → Y, paths x and y derived from F and a given path in X, and the induced maps on fundamental groups:
  • x_* : π1(X,x0) ≅ π1(X,x1) coming from the path x,
  • y_* : π1(Y,y0) ≅ π1(Y,y1) coming from the path y,
  • (f0)_* : π1(X,x0) → π1(Y,y0) and (f1)_* : π1(X,x1) → π1(Y,y1) induced by f0 = F(0, ·) and f1 = F(1, ·),
  and concludes the specific naturality identity y_* ∘ (f0)_* = (f1)_* ∘ x_*.
- The Lean code completely removes the topological context (spaces, homotopies, paths, fundamental groups). It does not define or refer to π1, basepoints, or the specific isomorphisms induced by paths. Instead, it asserts a universal algebraic equality for arbitrary groups, arbitrary isomorphisms, and arbitrary homomorphisms.
- This is not a faithful translation: the original asserts an equality under very specific geometric/topological hypotheses connecting f0, f1, x_*, y_*; the Lean code asserts that equality holds for any given data of group isomorphisms and homomorphisms, which is generally false and far stronger.
- Moreover, the code only claims equality of the underlying functions G0 → H1, not even of the homomorphisms as structured objects (though equality of functions would imply equality of homomorphisms when the types match), but the main issue remains the lack of any link to the topological constructions that justify the equality.

3) Final check: Are the math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is an abstract, universally quantified statement about arbitrary groups and maps, with no topological structure and no linkage between the maps akin to a homotopy. The original statement is a specific naturality property for induced maps on fundamental groups coming from a homotopy and chosen paths.
- Key differences:
  • Missing topology and π1 in the Lean code.
  • The Lean equality is claimed for arbitrary x_iso, y_iso, f0, f1, not those induced by the specific homotopy and paths.
  • No basepoints or path-induced conjugations are modeled.
  • The Lean theorem, as stated, is not only unfaithful but generally false absent the topological constraints.
Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: G0, G1, H0, H1 are types equipped with group structures.

The proof is omitted (by sorry).

This is a purely algebraic statement about arbitrary groups, group homomorphisms, and group isomorphisms, asserting the commutativity of a square for arbitrary choices.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: If f_t : X → Y is a homotopy of continuous maps with f0(x0) = f1(x0) = y0 (i.e., the basepoint is fixed by the homotopy), then the induced maps on fundamental groups are equal: (f0)_* = (f1)_* : π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, y0).
- Key features: topological data (spaces X, Y; homotopy of continuous maps), fundamental groups with the same basepoints in domain and codomain, and equality of the induced homomorphisms (no change-of-basepoint isomorphisms needed due to fixed basepoint).

Mismatch points:
- The Lean code does not mention topology, homotopies, or fundamental groups. It replaces them with arbitrary groups and homomorphisms.
- It asserts a commutative square y_iso ∘ f0 = f1 ∘ x_iso for arbitrary isomorphisms x_iso, y_iso and homomorphisms f0, f1. This is not the same as equality (f0)_* = (f1)_* in the basepoint-fixed case (which would correspond to taking x_iso and y_iso to be identities and having the same source and target groups).
- Even as an “abstract algebraic translation,” the Lean statement is far too general: it claims the square commutes for arbitrary choices of isomorphisms and homomorphisms, which is generally false unless extra structure constrains x_iso, y_iso, f0, f1 (e.g., they come from a specific homotopy/naturality setup). No such constraints are present.
- The original statement uses the same domain and codomain groups for (f0)_* and (f1)_*, while the Lean statement allows different domain (G0 vs G1) and codomain (H0 vs H1) and posits a commuting square through arbitrary isomorphisms.

3) Final check:
The Lean theorem statement is not a faithful translation of the original statement. It neither encodes the topological context nor the fixed-basepoint condition ensuring direct equality of induced maps. It asserts a much stronger and generally false equality in a purely algebraic setting. There are no vacuous placeholder definitions, but the theorem is unrelated in substance to the given topological claim.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions, but the final theorem is not a faithful translation and is essentially unrelated to the topological content; it even states an equality that is false in general. Hence a low score is appropriate.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's mathematics library.
- The theorem `matrix_with_pos_and_neg_eig_is_covering` is stated for an index type `n` with `Fintype n` and `DecidableEq n`, so vectors are functions `n → ℝ` (i.e., ℝ^n up to canonical equivalence). `A : Matrix n n ℝ` is a real n×n matrix.
- `h_inv : A.det ≠ 0` asserts that A is invertible (determinant nonzero over ℝ).
- `h_pos : ∃ (lam : ℝ) (v : n → ℝ), 1 < lam ∧ v ≠ 0 ∧ A.mulVec v = lam • v` states there exists a real eigenvalue λ > 1 with a nonzero eigenvector v for the linear map x ↦ A.mulVec x.
- `h_neg : ∃ (mu : ℝ) (w : n → ℝ), mu < -1 ∧ w ≠ 0 ∧ A.mulVec w = mu • w` states there exists a real eigenvalue μ < −1 with a nonzero eigenvector w.
- Conclusion: `IsCoveringMap (A.mulVec : (n → ℝ) → (n → ℝ))` asserts that the linear map given by multiplication by A, viewed as a function `(n → ℝ) → (n → ℝ)`, is a covering map (with respect to the standard/topological structures induced on these spaces).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Take an invertible matrix A with at least one eigenvalue λ satisfying λ > 1 and at least one eigenvalue satisfying λ < −1. Prove that A : ℝ^n → ℝ^n is a covering map.”
- Invertibility is encoded as `A.det ≠ 0`.
- Existence of an eigenvalue > 1 and an eigenvalue < −1 is encoded via the two existential hypotheses with nonzero eigenvectors, which is the standard definition of eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
- The function in question is precisely the linear map `A.mulVec : (n → ℝ) → (n → ℝ)`, which is the usual action of the matrix on vectors, i.e., the map ℝ^n → ℝ^n.
- The target property is exactly “is a covering map,” via `IsCoveringMap`.

3) Final check for equivalence:
- Domain/codomain: The code uses `(n → ℝ)` for ℝ^n with `n` an arbitrary finite type; this is a standard and harmless generalization equivalent to ℝ^n (usually represented as `Fin k → ℝ`). This is acceptable and faithful.
- Invertibility and eigenvalue conditions match exactly, with correct inequalities (> 1 and < −1) and proper eigenvector witnesses.
- Conclusion matches the natural language: `A` induces a covering map ℝ^n → ℝ^n.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly encodes the claim.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization (even slightly more general in the indexing of coordinates), with no problematic placeholders.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open TopologicalSpace Set MulAction`: Use Mathlib and open relevant namespaces.
- The docstring explains the intended statement: Γ a topological group acting on X, with compact quotient X/Γ; then (1) each orbit contains a point with compact stabilizer; (2) there is a compact K ⊆ X meeting every orbit.
- The theorem `exists_compact_set_intersecting_orbit_compact_stabilizer_of_compact_quotient` introduces types Γ and X with instances: `[Group Γ] [TopologicalSpace Γ] [IsTopologicalGroup Γ]` (i.e., Γ is a topological group), `[TopologicalSpace X]`, and an action `[MulAction Γ X]`. It also assumes a topology on the orbit space `[TopologicalSpace (Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X))]` and the compactness of that quotient `(h : CompactSpace (Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X)))`.
- The conclusion is a conjunction:
  • `(∀ x : X, ∃ y ∈ MulAction.orbit Γ x, IsCompact ((MulAction.stabilizer Γ y : Subgroup Γ) : Set Γ))`: For every x in X, there exists y in the orbit Γ • x such that the stabilizer subgroup of y (as a subset of Γ with the subspace topology) is compact.
  • `∃ K : Set X, IsCompact K ∧ ∀ x : X, ∃ g : Γ, g • x ∈ K`: There exists a compact set K in X that meets every Γ-orbit (since for each x, some translate g • x lies in K).
- `by sorry`: No proof is provided (acceptable for translation auditing).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypothesis “If a group Γ acts on a topological space X and X/Γ is compact” is translated as: there is a group action `[MulAction Γ X]`, topologies on Γ and X, and the orbit space `Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X)` is compact as a topological space (`CompactSpace`). This matches the intended meaning of “X/Γ is compact.”
- The first conclusion “every orbit Γ x contains a point x with compact stabilizer” is rendered as: for each x, there is y ∈ orbit Γ x with compact stabilizer in Γ. This is precisely the same statement (variable names aside).
- The second conclusion “X contains a compact set intersecting every Γ-orbit” is rendered as: there exists K ⊆ X compact such that for every x, there exists g with g • x ∈ K, i.e., K meets the orbit of x. This matches exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code assumes Γ is a topological group (`[TopologicalSpace Γ] [IsTopologicalGroup Γ]`), which is necessary to make sense of “compact stabilizer.” The natural statement implicitly needs a topology on Γ for that phrase, so this is appropriate, not a mismatch.
- The code does not assume continuity of the action (no `ContinuousSMul`), whereas “group acts on a topological space” sometimes implies continuity. However, the natural statement did not explicitly require continuity, and the conclusions only involve orbits and stabilizers as subsets, not continuity properties. This is at most a mild generalization and does not change the meaning of the claims.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; all concepts used are from Mathlib. The statement is not weakened or made vacuous.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement, with only benign, standard formal clarifications (topological group structure on Γ, explicit orbit quotient type).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We work with types X and Y equipped with topological space structures.

- `def IsSerreFibration (f : X → Y) : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate meant to express that f is a Serre fibration, but it is defined to be True for every map. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not capture the actual Serre fibration property.

- `def fiber (f : X → Y) (y : Y) := { x : X // f x = y }`: Defines the (set-theoretic) fiber of f over y as a subtype. This is a legitimate definition for the fiber.

- `def pi (n : ℕ) (X : Type _) (x0 : X) : Type _ := Unit`: Introduces a placeholder for the based homotopy group π_n(X, x0), but defines it as the trivial type Unit. This is a vacuous stand-in and does not reflect the homotopy group structure.

- `def long_exact_sequence_pred (f : X → Y) (y0 : Y) (x0 : X) : Prop := ∀ n : ℕ, True`: Introduces a predicate intended to express that the obvious maps π_n(F,x0) → π_n(X,x0) → π_n(Y,y0) fit into a long exact sequence for all n, but it is defined to be `True` for all n; hence completely vacuous and carries no mathematical content.

- `theorem long_exact_sequence_serre (f : X → Y) (hf : IsSerreFibration f) (y0 : Y) (x0 : X) (hx : f x0 = y0) : long_exact_sequence_pred f y0 x0 := by sorry`: States the main theorem: if f is a Serre fibration and f x0 = y0, then the long exact sequence predicate holds. However, since `IsSerreFibration` is always True and `long_exact_sequence_pred` is trivially True, the theorem asserts a triviality; furthermore, the proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If f: X → Y is a Serre fibration, then the natural maps between based homotopy groups of the fiber, total space, and base fit into a long exact sequence. This involves genuine notions: Serre fibration, based homotopy groups π_n, the fiber F over y0 with basepoint x0 mapping to y0, and exactness structure connecting π_n and π_{n-1}.

- The code uses placeholders for the key notions: `IsSerreFibration := True`, `pi := Unit`, and `long_exact_sequence_pred := ∀ n, True`. These are vacuous and do not encode the intended mathematical meanings. The only legitimate auxiliary definition is `fiber`, which is not even used in the final predicate.

- While the high-level shape of the theorem (given a Serre fibration and compatible basepoints, we have a long exact sequence in n) resembles the natural language claim, the formal content is empty: the predicate is always true, and the hypothesis is always satisfied. The code does not define or use the maps or exactness, nor any real homotopy groups.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code does not faithfully translate the statement. It replaces all nontrivial concepts with vacuous placeholders, making the theorem trivially true. If the placeholders were replaced with genuine definitions (real Serre fibration, homotopy groups, and an exactness predicate involving the specific maps and degree shift), the theorem statement would match the intended result. But as written, it is not a faithful translation.

Differences found:
- Serre fibration predicate is vacuous.
- Homotopy groups are replaced by the trivial type.
- Long exact sequence predicate is vacuous and does not mention the actual maps or exactness.
- The theorem therefore asserts a trivial truth and does not capture the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

Given the rubric, this is a case of vacuous placeholders where, if fixed, the final theorem would be faithful. Hence it fails faithfulness but merits a mid score.

  • It assumes X' is Hausdorff ([T2Space X']).
  • It includes the factorization data hcomp (P ∘ g_i = f_i), but this plays no role in the theorem statement; the equivalence is stated purely in terms of Y being coinduced from P and X' being T2.
  • The theorem is: T2Space Y ↔ Injective P.

- Differences:
  • The natural language setup starts with Y having the final topology from a family {f_i}, and mentions the existence of some P : X → Y that “includes” the f_i; but it does not explicitly assume that Y’s topology is coinduced from that P. The Lean code requires the stronger, specific assumption hfinal that Y’s topology equals the coinduced topology from P. This is an extra hypothesis absent from the NL statement.
  • The Lean code also assumes X' is Hausdorff ([T2Space X']). The NL statement does not state any Hausdorffness assumption on X (or on the X_i). This is another extra hypothesis.
  • The family {f_i} and the factorization g_i are not used in the theorem’s equivalence; the equivalence depends only on P and the coinduced topology assumption. Thus the part “includes all the f_i” from the NL statement is not reflected in the theorem statement itself.
  • Conceptually, the NL statement suggests starting from the family {f_i} and concluding a characterization in terms of an encompassing P, whereas the Lean statement takes as hypothesis that Y is coinduced from P and then characterizes Hausdorffness in terms of injectivity of P. This is a meaningful shift.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code adds substantial assumptions (Y is coinduced from P and X' is Hausdorff) and does not actually connect the {f_i} to the final equivalence beyond having unused variables. It therefore is not a faithful, direct translation of the original statement.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; all notions are Mathlib's. However, because of the extra hypotheses and the disconnection from the family {f_i} in the theorem statement, the translation is not faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The code overstrengthens hypotheses and shifts the focus to coinduced from a single P, while the NL statement frames things in terms of a family {f_i} and existence of an encompassing P.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Bring in mathlib (not directly used for concrete analytic/homotopy notions here).
- def MyIsDomain (Z : Set ℂ) : Prop := IsOpen Z ∧ IsPreconnected Z
  ""Z is a domain"" is modeled as: Z is open and preconnected. Note: in mathlib, IsConnected Z := Z.Nonempty ∧ IsPreconnected Z, so this misses nonemptiness; also domain typically means open and connected. So this is slightly off.
- def MyAnalyticOn {Z : Set ℂ} (g : Subtype Z → ℂ) : Prop := True
  ""g is complex-analytic on Z"" is modeled by a predicate that is always True. This is a vacuous placeholder, not a faithful analytic predicate.
- def MySendsLoopsToNullHomotopic {Z : Set ℂ} (g : Subtype Z → ℂ) : Prop := True
  ""g sends every loop in Z to a null-homotopic loop in ℂ \ {0}"" is modeled by a predicate that is always True. Again, vacuous placeholder.
- def MyHasLog {Z : Set ℂ} (g : Subtype Z → ℂ) : Prop := ∃ G : Subtype Z → ℂ, MyAnalyticOn G ∧ ∀ z, g z = Complex.exp (G z)
  ""g has a logarithm"" is modeled as: there exists G with (vacuous) analyticity and g = exp ∘ G. Since MyAnalyticOn G is True, this reduces to: ∃ G, ∀ z, g z = exp (G z). So this loses the analyticity requirement on G.
- theorem has_log_iff_conditions ... : MyHasLog g ↔ (∀ z, g z ≠ 0) ∧ MySendsLoopsToNullHomotopic g := by sorry
  Main equivalence: g has a logarithm iff g is nowhere zero and g sends loops to null-homotopic loops. But since MySendsLoopsToNullHomotopic is True, the RHS reduces to (∀ z, g z ≠ 0) ∧ True, and the LHS lacks analyticity on G. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for this task, but the statement is already distorted by the vacuous predicates.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Original statement: For Z ⊆ ℂ a domain (open and connected, nonempty), and g analytic on Z, a logarithm for g is an analytic G with g = e^G. Then g has a logarithm iff (1) g(z) ≠ 0 for all z and (2) g takes every loop in Z to a null-homotopic loop in ℂ \ {0}.
Differences:
- Domain: Code uses IsOpen ∧ IsPreconnected, missing nonemptiness and using preconnected instead of connected. Slight mismatch.
- Analyticity: The code’s MyAnalyticOn is defined as True, so both the assumption that g is analytic and the requirement that G be analytic are vacuous. This is a major deviation.
- Loop condition: MySendsLoopsToNullHomotopic is True, so the loop condition is trivialized. Another major deviation.
- MyHasLog ignores analyticity of G due to the vacuous predicate.
Thus, the code does not faithfully encode the analytic and homotopy content of the statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code uses vacuous placeholders for the crucial notions (analyticity and null-homotopic loop mapping), turning the equivalence into: (∃ G, g = exp ∘ G) ↔ (∀ z, g z ≠ 0), with no analyticity on G and no homotopy condition, and with a slightly off domain definition. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Auxiliary definitions assessment:
- MyAnalyticOn and MySendsLoopsToNullHomotopic are vacuous (:= True), violating the guideline against vacuous placeholders.
- MyIsDomain deviates slightly (missing nonempty; uses preconnected instead of connected).
- MyHasLog inherits the analyticity issue.
Hence, the translation fails.

Grade rationale:
Given the heavy use of vacuous predicates, but with the intended structure roughly suggested, if these placeholders were replaced by faithful definitions and the domain predicate adjusted, the theorem statement could be faithful. This corresponds to a 6 per the rubric.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- structure PointedCovering ...: A ""pointed covering"" from (X, x0) to (Y, y0) consists of a map toFun : X → Y, a basepoint condition toFun x0 = y0, and a field is_covering : Prop. Importantly, is_covering here is just an arbitrary proposition attached to the structure; it does not assert or encode that toFun is actually a covering map. So this structure does not faithfully represent covering maps.

- structure PointedCoveringMorphism ... (p q): A morphism between pointed coverings p : (X, x0) → (Y, y0) and q : (Z, z0) → (Y, y0) is a map X → Z sending x0 to z0 and commuting with the projections over Y: q.toFun ∘ toFun = p.toFun. This is a reasonable notion of morphism in the over-category of Y with basepoints.

- def IsIso (p q) : Prop := Nonempty (PointedCoveringMorphism p q) ∧ Nonempty (PointedCoveringMorphism q p). This purports to define “isomorphism,” but it only requires the existence of morphisms in both directions; it does not require them to be inverses or to compose to identities. This is strictly weaker than actual isomorphism/equivalence of coverings.

- Theorem universal_covering_characterization: Given Y Hausdorff (T2Space Y), a pointed covering s : (U, u0) → (Y, y0) with a universal property h_s_univ stating that for every pointed covering q over Y there exists a unique morphism from s to q, the statement claims that for any pointed covering p : (X, x0) → (Y, y0), the following are equivalent:
  (i) IsIso p s (in the above, too-weak sense);
  (ii) For every pointed covering q over Y, there exists a unique morphism from p to q.
Proof is omitted (sorry), but our task is to check the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Y Hausdorff, admits a universal covering. A covering map (X, x0) → (Y, y0) is universal iff every covering (Z, z0) → (Y, y0) admits a unique morphism (X, x0) → (Z, z0).
- The code tries to formalize this by fixing a specific universal covering s via h_s_univ and then characterizing when p is universal as “p is isomorphic to s.” This approach is appropriate in principle.
- However, there are two major issues:
  a) The notion of “pointed covering” is not actually enforced. The field is_covering : Prop is just an arbitrary proposition, not a proof that toFun is a covering map, nor is it tied to toFun in any way. This is a vacuous placeholder rather than a faithful encoding of covering maps.
  b) The definition IsIso is incorrect: it requires only morphisms in both directions, not inverse morphisms. Thus “isomorphic to s” is drastically weaker than genuine isomorphism of coverings. This makes the left side of the equivalence too weak relative to “p is universal.”
- The uniqueness property “∃! (f : PointedCoveringMorphism p q), True” is a legitimate way to state “there exists exactly one morphism,” since the predicate is always True.
- The Hausdorff assumption [T2Space Y] is included but not used; that’s acceptable as an extra hypothesis but does not fix the core issues above.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Differences:
  - The Lean structure does not faithfully represent covering maps; it uses a vacuous is_covering field unrelated to the map. Therefore the ambient category in the code is not actually the category of pointed coverings.
  - The Lean notion of IsIso is not true isomorphism; it only requires existence of maps both ways. Hence “p is universal (isomorphic to s)” in the code is weaker than “p is isomorphic to s” in the usual sense, and thus weaker than “p is universal.”
  - Because of (b), the left-to-right direction of the equivalence can fail in the intended mathematics: having merely maps both ways does not guarantee p has the universal initial property or is genuinely isomorphic to s. So the theorem statement is not faithful to the natural language characterization.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful formalization. It uses vacuous placeholders for coverings and a wrong definition of isomorphism. Even if the vacuity in PointedCovering were fixed, the incorrect IsIso still breaks faithfulness. Only after correcting both would the statement match the intended mathematics.

  This states: For any topological space X and points p,q,r,s,t,u in X, and any paths x from p to q, y from r to s, and z from t to u, we have the logical equivalence (q = r and s = t) if and only if (s = t and q = r). In other words, it is just commutativity of conjunction on the endpoint equalities. There is no mention of concatenation or homotopies; x, y, z appear only to provide endpoints.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks for two claims:
  (a) Associativity up to homotopy relative {0,1}: (x*y)*z is homotopic rel endpoints to x*(y*z).
  (b) Definability equivalence: (x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.
- The Lean theorem only asserts the tautology (q = r ∧ s = t) ↔ (s = t ∧ q = r). While these equalities are the conditions under which the two concatenations are defined, the theorem does not even mention the notion of concatenation or definability, nor does it assert homotopy or relative endpoints. Thus:
  - It does not state (a) at all.
  - For (b), it does not formalize the statement “(x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined”; it only states an equivalent logical equivalence of the endpoint equalities, without tying them to Path.comp/concat or any definability predicate.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical problems are different. The code proves only a trivial logical equivalence unrelated to path concatenation or homotopy. It omits the main associativity up to homotopy claim and does not connect the endpoint equalities to the definability of concatenations. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for an index type A.
- π : Type _, [Group π]: a group π (intended abstractly to play the role of π1(X, x0)).
- π_a : A → Type _, [∀ a, Group (π_a a)]: for each a ∈ A, a group π_a a (intended to be π1(X_a, x0)).
- π_ab : A × A → Type _, [∀ ab, Group (π_ab ab)]: for each pair (a, b), a group π_ab (a, b) (intended to be π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0)).
- incl_a : ∀ a, π_a a →* π: homomorphisms from each π_a into π (intended to come from inclusions X_a → X).
- f_left, f_right: for each (a, b), homomorphisms π_ab(a, b) →* π_a a and π_ab(a, b) →* π_a b (intended to come from inclusions X_a ∩ X_b → X_a and → X_b).
- hcompat: ∀ a b, (incl_a a).comp (f_left a b) = (incl_a b).comp (f_right a b): the composites to π of the two ways from π_ab coincide (intended to reflect that both inclusions X_a ∩ X_b → X give the same induced map on π1 up to identification).
- Γ : Type _, [Group Γ]: a target group.
- φ_a : ∀ a, π_a a →* Γ: given homomorphisms from each π_a to Γ.
- hφ: ∀ a b, (φ_a a).comp (f_left a b) = (φ_a b).comp (f_right a b): the φ_a agree on overlaps via the maps from π_ab.
- Conclusion: ∃! (Φ : π →* Γ), ∀ a, (Φ.comp (incl_a a)) = φ_a a: there exists a unique Φ extending the φ_a along incl_a.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is about fundamental groups arising from a topological space X with a cover by path connected, locally simply connected open sets with path connected overlaps; it states that compatible homomorphisms π1(X_a, x0) → Γ uniquely extend to a homomorphism π1(X, x0) → Γ. The topological hypotheses ensure the Seifert–van Kampen colimit property.
- The Lean statement abstracts entirely to an algebraic diagram of groups (π, π_a, π_ab) with structure maps and a single compatibility condition hcompat. It then asserts the universal property (existence and uniqueness of Φ) for arbitrary such data, not specifically those coming from π1 of a space and its open cover.
- Crucially, the code does not link π, π_a, π_ab, incl_a, f_left, f_right to fundamental groups or to the topological assumptions (path connectedness, locally simply connected). It also does not assume any universal property or colimit characterization of π relative to the diagram; it simply claims the universal property holds for any diagram satisfying hcompat. This is a much stronger and generally false statement unless π is known to be the colimit. Thus the code is not a faithful translation of the original theorem.
- On the positive side, the shape of the conclusion (unique extension of compatible maps φ_a via incl_a) and the overlap-compatibility conditions hφ mirror the intended universal property from van Kampen. The pairwise intersection level (π_ab) matches the stated use of pairwise overlaps. There are no vacuous placeholder definitions.

Final check:
- Original: Under specific topological hypotheses on X and its cover, π = π1(X, x0) has a universal property with respect to the diagram of π1(X_a, x0) and π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0), yielding a unique extension to Γ for compatible φ_a.
- Lean: For arbitrary groups π, π_a, π_ab with given structure maps satisfying one compatibility, any compatible family φ_a uniquely extends to a map π → Γ.
- These are different. The Lean statement omits the topological setup and asserts a universal property without assuming π has it due to topology. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions are used, and the algebraic shape mirrors the universal property intended. However, the essential topological hypotheses and the identification of π, π_a, π_ab as fundamental groups are entirely dropped, yielding a significantly generalized (and generally incorrect) statement. Hence a low-to-mid score.

The proof is omitted (sorry).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original: If Γ has a covering action on a simply connected and locally simply connected Hausdorff space Y, then the quotient map p : Y → Γ \ Y =: X is a universal covering map, so π1(X) ≅ Γ.

Discrepancies:
- Use of placeholders: Both LocallySimplyConnected and IsCoveringAction are empty/vacuous classes, not faithful definitions. This is a major red flag per the guidelines.
- Missing quotient specification: The theorem only asserts the existence of some space X and map p; it does not state that X is the orbit/quotient Γ \ Y nor that p is the quotient map.
- Universal vs covering: The statement only says IsCoveringMap p, not that p is a universal covering map.
- Basepoint and group iso: The code uses Nonempty (FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃ Γ). While basepoints are a technicality, the original specifically identifies X as the quotient and concludes π1(X) ≅ Γ for that X. Here, X is arbitrary and only asserted to exist; this weakens the statement substantially.
- No link to the action in constructing X: The existential quantifier over X does not connect X to Γ \ Y in any way. The original’s key content is exactly that the quotient map is the universal cover; this is absent.

Step 3: Final judgment
- The auxiliary classes are vacuous placeholders, violating the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate.
- Even ignoring the placeholders, the theorem statement is significantly weaker and different: it neither identifies X with the quotient nor asserts p is the quotient or universal. Hence, even with proper definitions substituted, the Lean statement would still not faithfully capture the original claim.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  This says: for any topological space X, any two points x0, x1 in X, and any path p from x0 to x1, there exists a group isomorphism (expressed as MulEquiv) between the fundamental groups π1(X, x0) and π1(X, x1). The body is a placeholder (by sorry), so no explicit construction is given in code.
- The docstring claims the intended map is [y] ↦ [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)], i.e., conjugation by p, but this is not enforced in the type or definition; it is only in a comment.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement specifies a very particular assignment: for a path x from x0 to x1, the map on π1 is given by [y] ↦ [\bar x * (y * x)], and claims that this assignment induces a group isomorphism π1(X, x0) → π1(X, x1).
- The Lean code, as written, only asserts the existence of some MulEquiv between π1(X, x0) and π1(X, x1) depending on a path p, without specifying that the isomorphism is the one induced by the explicit conjugation map [y] ↦ [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)]. The explicit formula appears only in a comment.

Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The natural language statement proves that a specific map (conjugation by the path) induces an isomorphism. The Lean code merely states the existence of an isomorphism parametrized by a path, without tying it to that explicit construction. Thus the code is weaker and does not faithfully capture the specific mapping.

Other checks:
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions: Path, FundamentalGroup, MulEquiv. No fake or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. The presence of sorry is acceptable here since the task allows no proofs, but it does mean the explicit construction is not encoded.

Conclusion: The translation is close but not faithful because it omits the explicit description of the induced map. Hence it does not fully match the natural language statement.

Identifying subsets of Subtype A with subsets of X contained in A, this is the familiar statement cl_A(S) = A ∩ cl_X(S).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- First part: The natural language says the closed subsets of A in the subspace topology are precisely sets of the form A ∩ C with C closed in X. The Lean statement characterizes closed subsets s of Subtype A as exactly preimages under the inclusion of closed subsets C of X. Since Subtype.val ⁻¹' C corresponds to A ∩ C, this is mathematically equivalent. It captures both directions (iff), hence faithful.
- Second part: The natural language says the closure of S ⊆ A inside A equals A ∩ closure_X(S). In Lean, S is a subset of Subtype A; its image in X is Subtype.val '' S, and the closure in the subspace equals the preimage of the closure of that image. This is exactly the standard equivalence: cl_A(S) = A ∩ cl_X(S) (interpreting S as a subset of X via the inclusion), so it is faithful.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Representation difference: Lean uses subsets of the subtype A and the inclusion map, whereas the natural language treats subsets of A as subsets of X. These are standardly equivalent via image/preimage under the inclusion. No vacuous or auxiliary placeholder definitions are introduced. The theorems state the correct bidirectional characterizations.
- Therefore, the Lean statements are legitimate and faithfully translate the natural language claims.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We work with topological spaces X and Xtil, a map p : Xtil → X, and a homeomorphism φ : Xtil ≃ₜ Xtil.
- The hypothesis hφ states that p ∘ (φ : Xtil → Xtil) = p, i.e., φ preserves the projection p (the usual deck-transformation condition).
- For an arbitrary type I (serving as the path parameter space), a function γ : I → X (called a path in the docstring), and a function γt : I → Xtil (a purported lift), together with the assumption hγ : p ∘ γt = γ (i.e., γt is a lift of γ), the conclusion is p ∘ (φ ∘ γt) = γ, i.e., φ ∘ γt is also a lift of γ.
- The theorem has a sorry proof, but the statement is clear and precise.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: In the setting of a covering map p : Xtil → X with X path connected and locally simply connected, any deck transformation φ : Xtil ≅ Xtil (i.e., a homeomorphism with p ∘ φ = p) takes any lift of a path γ to another lift of the same path γ.
- The Lean statement captures the core logical content: if φ is a homeomorphism satisfying p ∘ φ = p and γt is a lift of γ (p ∘ γt = γ), then p ∘ (φ ∘ γt) = γ, i.e., φ ∘ γt is again a lift of γ.

3) Differences and assessment:
- The Lean theorem does not assume p is a covering map, nor that X is path connected or locally simply connected. These hypotheses are not needed for the claimed property, so the Lean version is a generalization.
- The Lean theorem treats a “path” simply as a function γ : I → X from an arbitrary type I, without continuity assumptions or a specific interval domain. Likewise, “lift” is defined purely by the equation p ∘ γt = γ, with no continuity requirement. In the usual topological sense, paths and lifts are continuous maps; however, since φ is a homeomorphism, continuity of γt would imply continuity of φ ∘ γt automatically, so the essential content (preservation of the lifting equation) is faithfully captured. The Lean statement is thus more general but not misleading.
- The docstring mentions “if p is a covering map”, which aligns with the natural language, but the theorem itself does not require it—a harmless strengthening.

Conclusion: The code faithfully captures the core content that a deck transformation preserves lifts of paths, albeit in a slightly more general (and purely compositional) formulation. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem statement is legitimate and accurate to the intended meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and announces two classical facts (as statements only, using `sorry` for proofs).
- Theorem `real_finite_field_eq_R_or_C`: For any type `k` with `[Field k]` and an `ℝ`-algebra structure `[Algebra Real k]`, and such that `k` is finite-dimensional as an `ℝ`-vector space `[FiniteDimensional Real k]`, we have: `Nonempty (k ≃ₐ[Real] Real) ∨ Nonempty (k ≃ₐ[Real] Complex)`. In words: A finite-dimensional `ℝ`-algebra that is a field is (as an `ℝ`-algebra) isomorphic to `ℝ` or to `ℂ`.
- Theorem `complex_is_algebraically_closed`: `IsAlgClosed Complex`. In words: The complex numbers are algebraically closed; equivalently, every polynomial with complex coefficients splits as a product of linear factors over `ℂ`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The first part ""Suppose that k is a field containing ℝ and of finite dimension as a real vector space. Then k = ℝ or k = ℂ, up to isomorphism."" is faithfully captured by `real_finite_field_eq_R_or_C`. The condition ""containing ℝ"" is modeled by `[Algebra Real k]` (which for fields is automatically injective), and finite-dimensionality over `ℝ` is `[FiniteDimensional Real k]`. The conclusion ""up to isomorphism"" is expressed via `Nonempty (k ≃ₐ[Real] Real)` or `Nonempty (k ≃ₐ[Real] Complex)`.
- The ""in particular"" has two claims:
  (a) ""the splitting field of any real or complex polynomial in one variable has degree at most 2 over ℝ"" — This is not stated anywhere in the Lean code. While it is indeed a corollary of the first theorem, the code does not include it.
  (b) ""every complex polynomial in one variable splits into a product of linear factors over ℂ"" — This is exactly what `IsAlgClosed Complex` asserts, so the second theorem covers this part.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- The Lean code correctly formalizes the main classification statement and the fact that `ℂ` is algebraically closed. However, it omits the explicit corollary about the degree of splitting fields over `ℝ`. Therefore, the translation is close but not complete: one of the ""in particular"" consequences is missing.

No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; the theorems use standard Mathlib notions (`Algebra`, `FiniteDimensional`, `≃ₐ`, `IsAlgClosed`). The omission of the splitting field degree corollary is the only substantive mismatch.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- onePointIsOpen: For U ⊆ Option X (interpreting Option X as X ∪ {∞} with none ≙ ∞ and some x ≙ x ∈ X), U is declared open if either (i) there exists an open set V ⊆ X with U = some '' V (i.e., U is exactly an open subset of X viewed inside Option X), or (ii) there exists a compact C ⊆ X with U = {none} ∪ some '' (univ \ C) (i.e., U contains ∞ and its intersection with X is the complement of a compact subset).
- instance : TopologicalSpace (Option X): They set the IsOpen predicate of the topology to be onePointIsOpen, and attempt to prove the topology axioms (univ is open, closed under finite intersections, and arbitrary unions). However, all these proofs are left as sorry.
- isOpen_iff: A restatement that IsOpen U is equivalent to the disjunction in onePointIsOpen. Since IsOpen is defined to be onePointIsOpen, this is definally true, but the proof is left as sorry.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the natural language statement.
- The natural language says: define a topology on X ∪ {∞} by declaring opens to be either the opens of X (viewed as subsets not containing ∞) or sets of the form {∞} ∪ (X \ C) with C compact. Prove this defines a topology (the one-point compactification).
- The Lean predicate onePointIsOpen exactly matches that definition using Option X for X ∪ {∞}. The two cases correspond precisely to the intended ones. Using Option.some '' V and {none} ∪ Option.some '' (univ \ C) is a faithful encoding.
- However, the crucial part “Prove that this defines a topology” is not supplied: the TopologicalSpace instance fields isOpen_univ, isOpen_inter, and isOpen_sUnion are all sorry. Thus, the code does not actually prove the topology axioms; it merely asserts an instance with unproved fields. The final theorem isOpen_iff is also left as sorry.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Mathematical content alignment: The definition of the open sets is faithful. The type Option X is an acceptable formal stand-in for X ∪ {∞}. The two cases match the natural language precisely.
- Missing proof: The natural language asks to prove this collection is a topology. The Lean code leaves the topology axioms as sorry, so the proof is missing. Per the guidelines, the presence of sorry in crucial places makes the translation fail.

Conclusion: While the definitional part is accurate, the code does not complete the proof obligations and uses sorry in the core instance. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the “prove it is a topology” statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `class LocallySimplyConnected (X : Type*) (tX : TopologicalSpace X) : Prop := (out : True)`
  This introduces a class intended to mean “X is locally simply connected,” but it is defined vacuously (always True), so it carries no actual content.

- `axiom π1 (X : Type*) (tX : TopologicalSpace X) : Type*`
  Introduces an unpointed “fundamental group” type for a topological space, as an axiom, without basepoints or construction.

- `axiom π1_group : ∀ (X : Type*) (tX : TopologicalSpace X), Group (π1 X tX)`
  Asserts (axiomatically) that π1 is a group for every space.

- `structure Covering (Y X : Type*) (tY : TopologicalSpace Y) (tX : TopologicalSpace X) := (toFun : Y → X)`
  Defines a “covering” as merely a function Y → X, with no topological or covering properties (no local triviality, etc.). This is far weaker than a covering map.

- `axiom covering_induced_map ... (p : Covering Y X tY tX) : (π1 Y tY) → (π1 X tX)`
  Posits a function on fundamental groups induced by a “covering,” but with no structure (not even a group homomorphism is asserted), and tied to the above weak notion of covering.

- `def is_subgroup {G : Type*} [Group G] (H : Set G) : Prop := True`
  A predicate saying H is a subgroup, defined as True; i.e., vacuous.

- The theorem `exists_connected_covering_for_subgroup ...` states:
  Given a topological space X with a PathConnectedSpace instance and a (vacuous) LocallySimplyConnected instance, and a set Γ ⊆ π1(X) with (vacuous) is_subgroup Γ, there exists:
  • a type Y,
  • a topology tY on Y,
  • a “covering” p : Y → X (just a function),
  • a PathConnectedSpace instance on Y,
  such that the set-theoretic range of the (axiomatic) covering_induced_map equals Γ, and moreover for any other Y' with a “covering” p' and PathConnectedSpace Y' whose induced map has the same range Γ, there exists a unique function f : Y → Y' with p' ∘ f = p.
  The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For X path connected and locally simply connected, and Γ ≤ π1(X), there exists a connected covering space p : X_Γ → X whose induced map on fundamental groups has image Γ, and X_Γ is unique up to unique isomorphism of coverings.

- Major discrepancies:
  • Local simply connectedness: The code’s LocallySimplyConnected is vacuous (True), not the actual topological property.
  • Fundamental group: The code uses an unbased π1(X) as a type axiomatically, whereas the genuine theory uses π1(X, x0) with basepoints; classification of coverings hinges on basepoints and connectedness vs path-connectedness issues. The code obscures this crucial detail.
  • Covering space: The code’s Covering is just a function Y → X, not a topological covering map (no continuity, no covering properties). This is a severe weakening.
  • Induced map on π1: The code postulates an arbitrary function covering_induced_map with no guarantee it’s the induced homomorphism of groups. No continuity or basepoint data are used.
  • Subgroup hypothesis: `is_subgroup` is defined as True, so the hypothesis that Γ is a subgroup is vacuous.
  • Connectedness of the covering: The natural language requests a connected covering space; the code requires PathConnectedSpace Y (path connectedness). These are not equivalent in general. Even if in nice settings connected coverings over locally path connected spaces are path connected, the code’s assertion is different and stronger than stated.
  • Uniqueness up to unique isomorphism: The code only asserts existence of a unique function f : Y → Y' over X for each other Y' with the same property. It does not assert f is an isomorphism of coverings (no continuity, no bijectivity, no inverse, no homeomorphism). Moreover, the quantification gives Y an initial-object-like universal property but does not itself yield isomorphism; to conclude isomorphism one would need a two-sided unique map or additional facts saying any morphism of connected coverings over X is an isomorphism, none of which are present. Thus the “unique up to unique isomorphism” clause is not captured.

3) Final comparison:
- The code uses multiple vacuous placeholders (LocallySimplyConnected := True, is_subgroup := True) and a drastically weakened notion of covering. Even if these placeholders were replaced by faithful Mathlib definitions, the theorem statement would still fail to capture the natural statement accurately because:
  • It demands path connectedness of the total space instead of connectedness.
  • It formulates uniqueness as a unique map rather than unique isomorphism of coverings, and gives no conditions to guarantee that map is an isomorphism.
  • It lacks basepoint data critical for the image Γ ⊆ π1(X) and the classification correspondence.

Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- def gram {n} (v : Fin n → Fin n → ℝ) : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ := fun i j => ∑ k, v i k * v j k. This defines the Gram matrix of n vectors in ℝ^n, where v i : Fin n → ℝ is the coordinate function of the i-th vector, and the entry A_{ij} is the dot product of v_i and v_j. This matches A_{ij} = ⟨v_i, v_j⟩ with the standard inner product.

This states: Given a continuous f on the space of n-tuples of vectors (encoded as v : Fin n → Fin n → ℝ), and assuming an invariance property hU, there exists a continuous g on all n×n real matrices such that g(gram v) = f v for all v.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: f(v_1,...,v_n) is continuous and invariant under simultaneous orthogonal transformations of ℝ^n coordinates: f(U v_1, ..., U v_n) = f(v_1,...,v_n) for all U ∈ O(n). The conclusion: There exists continuous g defined on Y, the set of positive semidefinite symmetric matrices, such that f(v_1,...,v_n) = g(A), where A is the Gram matrix A_{ij} = ⟨v_i, v_j⟩.

Key checks:
- The Gram definition is correct.
- Continuity hypothesis on f is present.
- The target conclusion asserts the existence of g with g(gram v) = f v; Lean’s g is defined on all matrices rather than only Y. That is a harmless generalization (one can restrict to Y), so this is acceptable.
- The critical invariance hypothesis hU is incorrect. In Lean, hU uses the transformation v ↦ v' with v' i j = ∑ k U i k * v k j. Here, the first index i (which denotes which vector in the n-tuple) is being mixed by U with the index k (also a vector index), while j is the coordinate index. This means U acts on the vector-label dimension (rows of the matrix of vectors), not on the coordinate dimension. In matrix terms, if W is the n×n matrix with entries W_{i j} = v_i[j], the Lean hU corresponds to left multiplication W ↦ U W (row action), not to the intended column action W ↦ W Uᵀ describing the simultaneous orthogonal transformation of vectors in ℝ^n.
- In contrast, the natural statement requires invariance under applying U to each vector’s coordinates: v' i j = ∑ k U j k * v i k (i.e., column action). This is a different group action and not equivalent to row mixing.
- Moreover, under the correct (column) action, the Gram matrix is invariant: (W Uᵀ)(W Uᵀ)ᵀ = W Uᵀ U Wᵀ = W Wᵀ. Under the Lean (row) action, the Gram transforms as (U W)(U W)ᵀ = U (W Wᵀ) Uᵀ, which is generally not equal to W Wᵀ. Therefore, the invariance assumed in the Lean code does not align with the invariance in the problem and does not support factoring through the Gram map as stated.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
- Main discrepancy: The invariance hypothesis in Lean is with respect to an orthogonal action on the index of vectors (row action), not the simultaneous orthogonal transformation of ℝ^n (column action). This is a substantive mismatch and changes the problem.
- Lesser discrepancy: The Lean conclusion defines g on all matrices rather than on Y (PSD symmetric); this is a generalization and acceptable because one can restrict g to Y. Also, every PSD symmetric n×n matrix is a Gram matrix of some n vectors in ℝ^n, so the image of gram is Y. But this does not rescue the main mismatch.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation due to the incorrect formulation of the invariance property. Everything else is mostly aligned, but the core hypothesis is wrong, so the translation fails.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- The theorem reparam_homotopic_relative_endpoints is stated for a topological space X and functions x, y : ℝ → X, intended to represent paths on the unit interval. Continuity is only required on the closed interval [0,1] via ContinuousOn x (Icc 0 1) and ContinuousOn y (Icc 0 1).
- There is a function τ : ℝ → ℝ with the following properties:
  - hτ_cont: τ is continuous (on ℝ; stronger than needed).
  - hτ_mono: τ is strictly increasing on the interval Icc (0 : ℝ) (1 : ℝ), i.e., StrictMonoOn τ on [0,1].
  - hτ_image: τ maps [0,1] into [0,1].
  - hτ0: τ(0) = 0 and hτ1: τ(1) = 1.
  - hyx: For all t ∈ [0,1], y (τ t) = x t, i.e., y ∘ τ = x on [0,1].
- Conclusion: There exists a homotopy H : ℝ × ℝ → X which is continuous on the square [0,1] × [0,1] (expressed as ContinuousOn H (Icc 0 1 × Icc 0 1)) and satisfies the boundary conditions:
  - H(t, 0) = x t for all t ∈ [0,1]
  - H(t, 1) = y t for all t ∈ [0,1]
  - H(0, s) = x 0 for all s ∈ [0,1]
  - H(1, s) = x 1 for all s ∈ [0,1]
These are exactly the standard boundary conditions for a homotopy between x and y relative to the endpoints, phrased using ContinuousOn on the square rather than a function defined on the subtype [0,1] × [0,1]. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: X topological space; x, y: [0,1] → X are paths. There exists a continuous, strictly increasing τ: [0,1] → [0,1] with τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1 and y ∘ τ = x. Conclude x is homotopic to y relative {0,1}.
- Lean code mirrors this precisely:
  - Uses ℝ as ambient domain but restricts all continuity and equalities to Icc 0 1, matching [0,1].
  - τ is continuous, strictly increasing on [0,1], maps [0,1] to itself, and fixes endpoints, and y ∘ τ = x on [0,1].
  - Concludes existence of a homotopy H on the square with the correct boundary conditions for rel {0,1}.
- The condition H(1, s) = x 1 (and H(0, s) = x 0) is appropriate for “relative {0,1}”. Since hyx with τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1 implies y 0 = x 0 and y 1 = x 1, this matches the standard requirement that both endpoints are fixed.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Domain choice: ℝ vs [0,1]. The Lean code imposes all conditions on Icc 0 1 and only requires continuity on that set; this is a faithful formalization of paths on [0,1].
- Strength of hypotheses: hτ_cont is on ℝ rather than on [0,1]; this is a harmless strengthening.
- Conclusion: The boundary conditions and continuity on the square are stated in the standard way for a homotopy relative to {0,1}.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; only a theorem with an omitted proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.
