The quaternion group Q = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, in which i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1,
(-1)^2 = 1, and the symbols i,j,k multiply like standard unit vectors according
to the usual cross-product rules in ℝ^3, is presented by ⟨a, b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2⟩.

This file records that statement formally. A full proof (construction of the
isomorphism between Q₈ and the quotient of the free group on two generators by
the normal closure of the relations a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2) is omitted.
