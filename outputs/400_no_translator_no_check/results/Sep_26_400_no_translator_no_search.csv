theorem neg_one_mul_srdoty {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a : R) : (-1 : R) * a = -a := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library.
- Comment: Restates the problem: Let R be a ring and a ∈ R. Show (-1) a = -a.
- `theorem neg_one_mul_srdoty {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a : R) : (-1 : R) * a = -a := by sorry`: For any type R with a ring structure and any element a of R, the theorem claims that multiplying a by -1 on the left yields the additive inverse of a, i.e., (-1) * a = -a. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: it quantifies over an arbitrary ring R and an element a ∈ R, and asserts (-1) * a = -a. No extraneous assumptions (like commutativity) are added; `Ring R` is the standard ring structure in Mathlib. The placement of multiplication is left multiplication, matching the notation (-1)a.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary definitions or vacuous placeholders altering meaning. The omission of the proof (`sorry`) does not affect the faithfulness of the translation of the statement itself per the task instructions.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- import Mathlib: Loads the Mathlib library; fine.
- variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]: Introduces a type R equipped with a Ring structure. This matches “Let R be a ring.” Lean's Ring includes a multiplicative identity and may be noncommutative, which is standard and acceptable for this statement.
- theorem neg_mul_neg_ring (a b : R) : (-a) * (-b) = a * b := by sorry: States that for any a, b in R, the product of their negatives equals the product a*b. This exactly matches “Show that (−a)(−b) = ab.” The proof is omitted (sorry), but our task is to assess translation, not proof.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean theorem exactly encodes the desired statement: given a ring R and elements a, b ∈ R, we have (−a)(−b) = a*b.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language allows any ring; Lean uses Ring R, which is the standard ring structure (with 1, possibly noncommutative). The property stated does not depend on commutativity or the existence of 1, so this is not a problematic strengthening.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the standard Mathlib library; fine.
- The theorem statement: `theorem mul_sub_left {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with a ring structure, and for any elements a, b, c in R, we have a · (b − c) = a · b − a · c. This is exactly the left distributivity of multiplication over subtraction in a ring.
  The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; per the instructions we are only checking the translation of the statement, not the proof.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: Let R be a ring and a, b, c ∈ R. Show that a(b − c) = ab − ac. The Lean theorem asserts exactly that under `[Ring R]` and variables `a b c : R`.

3) Final check:
- The math problems are the same. The only possible nuance is that Lean's `Ring` includes a multiplicative identity 1, whereas some conventions allow rings without 1; however this extra structure is unused and does not change the statement. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. Hence, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, the standard library.
- Comment explains the lemma: in any ring, multiplying by 0 yields 0 on either side.
- `theorem mul_zero_and_zero_mul {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a : R) : a * 0 = 0 ∧ 0 * a = 0 := by sorry`
  This states: For any type R equipped with a Ring structure, and any element a in R, we have both equalities a * 0 = 0 and 0 * a = 0. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Fidelity to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Let R be a ring and a ∈ R. Show that a·0 = 0 = 0·a. In formal logic, the chained equality means both a·0 = 0 and 0·a = 0. The Lean theorem states exactly these two equalities conjunctively for any ring R and any a : R. Thus, the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumptions match: Ring structure on R and element a ∈ R.
- Conclusion matches: both a * 0 = 0 and 0 * a = 0. The chain equality in the natural language is equivalent to the conjunction used in Lean.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement. Slightly stronger structure (Ring) than necessary (it would hold in a Semiring), but the statement also asks for a ring, so it's exactly aligned.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For a natural number n with 1 < n, and elements a, b in ZMod n, if a is a unit in ZMod n, then there exists an x in ZMod n such that a * x = b in ZMod n.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: Let n > 1 be an integer. If the class [a] in Z_n is a unit, then the congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) has a solution in Z_n.
- The Lean theorem precisely asserts the existence of x in ZMod n satisfying a * x = b (equality in ZMod n), which is exactly the same as ax ≡ b (mod n). The hypothesis `IsUnit a` captures that [a] is a unit. The parameters `a b : ZMod n` represent the residue classes modulo n. The hypothesis `1 < n` matches the condition n > 1 in the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Using `n : Nat` instead of an integer n is a standard formalization choice since moduli are nonnegative; the condition `1 < n` implies n is a positive integer greater than 1, aligning with the natural language.
- Quantifying directly over `a b : ZMod n` matches the statement's focus on the residue classes [a], [b].
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with an existential conclusion.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  Translates to: For any integer n with 0 < n (so n is a positive integer) and integers a, b, c, if a is congruent to b modulo n and b is congruent to c modulo n (where `Int.ModEq n x y` means n divides x - y), then a is congruent to c modulo n. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing; the statement itself is precise.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The Lean statement exactly captures the natural language statement: n is a positive integer (via `hn : 0 < n`), a, b, c are integers, and the transitivity of congruence modulo n is asserted.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language says ""Let n be a fixed positive integer""; the Lean code treats n as an arbitrary integer with `0 < n`. This matches the intent.
- Using `Int` rather than `Nat` for n is fine since positivity is required, aligning with a positive integer. No extraneous or missing conditions.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def approx (a b : Real) : Prop := ∃ n : Int, a - b = n`
  This defines a relation on the reals: a ≈ b holds iff there exists an integer n such that a - b equals n (interpreting the integer n as a real via the standard coercion). This exactly captures “a − b ∈ ℤ”.
- `infix:50 "" ≈ "" => approx`
  Introduces the infix notation ≈ for the relation approx, so we can write a ≈ b.
- `theorem approx_equivalence : Equivalence (fun a b => approx a b) := by sorry`
  States that the relation approx on ℝ is an equivalence relation (i.e., reflexive, symmetric, transitive). Using `Equivalence` is standard for this notion in Lean. The proof is omitted (by `sorry`), which is acceptable for checking the faithfulness of the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language defines a ≈ b iff a − b ∈ ℤ. The Lean definition uses “∃ n : Int, a − b = n”, which is equivalent.
- The natural language asks to prove that ≈ is an equivalence relation on ℝ. The Lean theorem states exactly that via `Equivalence (fun a b => approx a b)`.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous or missing hypotheses.
- No vacuous placeholders: the definition of the relation is substantive and correct; `Equivalence` is the proper notion.
- Using equality to an integer with implicit coercion to ℝ is standard and faithful to “∈ ℤ”.
- No auxiliary fake definitions; the only definition is the intended relation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in Mathlib, giving access to standard number theory notions like congruence `Int.ModEq`.
- The docstring exactly restates the natural language statement.
- The theorem declaration:
  - `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_673 (n : ℤ) (hn : 0 < n) {a b c d : ℤ}`: Let n be an integer with 0 < n (so n is a positive integer), and a, b, c, d be integers.
  - Hypotheses: `(hab : Int.ModEq n a b)` means a ≡ b mod n; `(hcd : Int.ModEq n c d)` means c ≡ d mod n.
  - Conclusion: `Int.ModEq n (a * c) (b * d)` means ac ≡ bd mod n.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement (the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the task since we judge only the statement/translation).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a,b,c,d ∈ ℤ. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- The Lean statement precisely matches this: n is an integer with 0 < n; a, b, c, d are integers; and from a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), it concludes ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- Using `Int.ModEq n x y` is the standard Mathlib encoding of x ≡ y (mod n) over ℤ.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The code's hypotheses and conclusion match the natural language exactly. The extra positivity assumption `hn : 0 < n` aligns with “n is a fixed positive integer.” No discrepancies or generalizations/specializations beyond that.

Grade rationale:
- Fully faithful translation with standard Mathlib notions, no bogus definitions, and the theorem statement matches the original precisely.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement is: For a ring R and a, b in R, show that a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b. This chain equality means two equalities: a(-b) = -(ab) and -(ab) = (-a)b. The Lean code states exactly these two equalities individually and together as a conjunction. The orientation of the second equality in the conjunction is `-(a*b) = (-a)*b`, which is equivalent to `(-a)*b = -(a*b)` by symmetry of equality; this is purely cosmetic.

3) Final check:
- Natural language: a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b.
- Lean: a*(-b) = -(a*b) and (-a)*b = -(a*b), combined as a*(-b) = -(a*b) ∧ -(a*b) = (-a)*b.
They are the same mathematical content. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms come from Mathlib. The use of `[Ring R]` assumes a unital ring, which aligns with a common definition of ring and does not affect the statement here. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `Int.ModEq n a b ↔ Int.emod a n = Int.emod b n` states that a is congruent to b modulo n if and only if the Euclidean remainders of a and b upon division by n are equal. Here, `Int.ModEq n a b` is the standard notion of modular congruence for integers, and `Int.emod a n` is the standard nonnegative remainder (in [0, n) when n > 0).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For integers n > 0 and a, b, we have a ≡ b (mod n) if and only if a and b have the same remainder upon division by n.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: the left side uses Int.ModEq to express a ≡ b (mod n), and the right side uses equality of `Int.emod` remainders, which are the usual remainders for positive modulus. The assumption hn: 0 < n ensures the remainder notion is the standard one.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous auxiliary definitions are introduced.
- The use of Int.emod appropriately captures “remainder upon division by n” for n > 0.
- The theorem is precisely the same as the natural language statement, with standard formalizations of the two notions involved.

  This declares a theorem: for any integer n and integers a, b, c, d, if a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then both a + c ≡ b + d (mod n) and a*c ≡ b*d (mod n). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable here since we're checking the statement/translation.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean statement exactly matches the mathematical content: preservation of congruence under addition and multiplication for integers modulo n.

3) Final check/differences:
- Natural language assumes n is a positive integer. The Lean code allows any integer n (possibly 0 or negative). This is a slight generalization, not a mismatch, and is standard since Int.ModEq is defined for any n and the statements remain true. No other discrepancies.

- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_970 (R : Type*) [CommRing R] : IsField R ↔ Set.range (fun u : Rˣ => (u : R)) = (Set.univ : Set R) \ {0} := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with a commutative ring structure, R is a field if and only if the set of elements of R that occur as the underlying element of some unit (i.e., the image of R^× under the coercion to R) equals the set of all nonzero elements of R.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: A commutative ring R is a field iff R^× = R \ {0}. Since R^× is a type of units, to compare with a subset of R one takes the image of units under the coercion (u : R). In Lean, this is exactly `Set.range (fun u : Rˣ => (u : R))`.
- The right-hand side `(Set.univ : Set R) \ {0}` is precisely the set of nonzero elements of R, i.e., R \ {0}.
- Therefore the equivalence `IsField R ↔ (image of units) = (nonzero elements)` exactly formalizes the intended statement that the set of invertible elements equals the set of nonzero elements.

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions (`IsField`, `Rˣ`, `Set.range`).
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the mathematical statement. There are no mismatches or scope issues; any minor type-theoretic nuance (comparing a type Rˣ to a subset of R) is handled properly by taking the image.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem subgroups_Z_eq_multiples (H : AddSubgroup ℤ) : ∃ n : ℕ, (H : Set ℤ) = {m : ℤ | (n : ℤ) ∣ m} := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any additive subgroup H of the integers, there exists a natural number n such that the underlying set of H is exactly the set of integers divisible by n (i.e., the set of multiples of n).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement says: ""Prove that the subgroups of (ℤ,+) are exactly the subgroups nℤ for integers n."" The Lean theorem asserts that every additive subgroup H of ℤ equals the set of multiples of some n. This is precisely the classification of subgroups of ℤ as nℤ. Using the set `{m : ℤ | (n : ℤ) ∣ m}` is the standard way to write nℤ as a subset of ℤ. Quantifying `n : ℕ` instead of `n : ℤ` is a harmless normalization (since nℤ = (|n|)ℤ, one typically chooses n ≥ 0). Thus the core mathematical meaning matches: every subgroup is of the form nℤ.

3) Final check and differences:
- Lean uses `n : ℕ` rather than `n : ℤ`; this is a standard canonical choice (using |n|), not a substantive change.
- Lean states equality of the underlying set of H with the set of multiples of n; this is equivalent to saying H = nℤ as subgroups in ℤ.
- The statement does not explicitly include the converse direction (that for each n, nℤ is a subgroup), but this is inherent in the phrase ""subgroups nℤ"" and is a well-known fact; the heart of the classification is the existence/equality asserted here. As a translation of the classification claim, this is faithful.
No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the only omission is the proof (`sorry`), which we ignore per instructions. Overall, the Lean theorem faithfully captures the natural language statement.

  This declares (noncomputably) an additive group isomorphism between ZMod m × ZMod n and ZMod (m*n), under the hypotheses that m and n are natural numbers with m ≥ 1, n ≥ 1, and coprime. The `by sorry` is a placeholder for the construction/proof, but the type encodes precisely the statement that such an isomorphism exists.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For integers m, n ≥ 1 with gcd(m, n) = 1, Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}.
- The code uses m, n : Nat with 1 ≤ m, 1 ≤ n and `m.Coprime n`. This matches the condition gcd(m, n) = 1 for positive integers. Using `ZMod k` to represent Z_k is standard in Mathlib; as additive groups, these are the cyclic groups of order k for k ≥ 1. The isomorphism type `≃+` is exactly an additive group isomorphism, which is the intended meaning in the group-theory version of the statement. The direction of the equivalence (product to ZMod (mn)) is immaterial since equivalences are symmetric.

3) Final check for differences:
- Integers vs natural numbers: the statement restricts to m, n ≥ 1; modeling them as natural numbers with ≥ 1 is equivalent for this purpose.
- gcd = 1 vs `Coprime`: equivalent.
- Group vs ring isomorphism: The natural-language statement is usually understood in the context of abelian groups; the code explicitly states an additive group isomorphism, which matches that interpretation. Even if one intended the ring version, the additive group statement remains true and is a faithful formalization of the group-theoretic claim.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the only placeholder is the proof (`sorry`), which does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The declaration sets up: p : ℕ with hp : Nat.Prime p; G is a type with a Group structure and a Fintype instance (so G is a finite group).
- Hypothesis h: ∀ g : G, ∃ n : ℕ, orderOf g = p ^ n asserts that every element of G has order a power of p.
- Conclusion: IsPGroup p G.

In Mathlib, IsPGroup p G is a standard predicate. Its commonly used definition is that every element of G has order a power of p (the “p-group” in the broad sense, not necessarily finite), i.e., precisely the property expressed by h. Thus the theorem statement is essentially: from the hypothesis that every element has order a p-power, conclude the predicate that every element has order a p-power. In other words, the conclusion matches the hypothesis rather than concluding anything about the group’s cardinality.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement claims: If G is finite and every element has order a power of a fixed prime p, then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.
- The Lean code concludes IsPGroup p G, which (in Mathlib) encodes that every element has order a p-power, not that the cardinality of G is a p-power. So it does not state |G| = p^r.
- Even if one were to interpret IsPGroup as “G is a p-group,” Mathlib’s IsPGroup is (by design) the element-order property, not the cardinality property. The intended finite-cardinality consequence |G| = p^r is a nontrivial theorem that is not captured by the given statement.
- The natural language statement also specifies r ≥ 1, which excludes the trivial group; the Lean code does not include any nontriviality assumption and does not express any lower bound on an exponent.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement concludes IsPGroup p G (element-order p-powers), which is essentially the same as the hypothesis provided in the Lean code and not the desired conclusion about |G| being a power of p. The natural language conclusion specifically concerns the cardinality of G and the existence of an exponent r (with r ≥ 1). The Lean statement omits this and instead asserts a different property.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code to natural language.
- variable {F : Type*} [Field F]: Fix a field F.
- variable {n : Type*} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]: Fix a finite index type n (with decidable equality), so matrices of size n×n make sense (this is mathlib’s generalization of n as a natural number).
- variable (G : Subgroup (GL n F)): Let G be a subgroup of the general linear group GL n F.
- def H_set : Set (GL n F) := {A | A ∈ (G : Set (GL n F)) ∧ (Matrix.det (A : Matrix n n F) = 1 ∨ Matrix.det (A : Matrix n n F) = -1)}: Define H_set to be the set of elements A in GL n F such that A ∈ G and det(A) = 1 or det(A) = -1. Here det is taken of the matrix corresponding to A, and 1, -1 are elements of the field F.
- theorem H_is_subgroup_of_G : ∃ (Hsub : Subgroup (GL n F)), (Hsub ≤ G) ∧ (∀ A : GL n F, A ∈ Hsub ↔ A ∈ H_set G): The statement asserts there exists a subgroup Hsub of GL n F contained in G whose underlying set is exactly H_set G.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let F be a field, G ≤ GL_n(F), and define H = {A ∈ G : det A = ±1}. Prove H is a subgroup of G.
Lean: Exactly sets H_set = {A ∈ G | det A = 1 or det A = -1}, and then asserts the existence of a subgroup Hsub with that underlying set and Hsub ≤ G. This is precisely the formal way to state “H is a subgroup of G.”

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Indexing: Lean uses a finite type n rather than a natural number dimension. This is a standard mathlib generalization and is acceptable.
- Determinant: They coerce A : GL n F to a Matrix n n F and use Matrix.det, encoding det A = ±1 as an explicit disjunction det = 1 ∨ det = -1. This matches the intended meaning.
- Form: The Lean theorem states existence of a subgroup whose underlying set equals H_set and is contained in G, which is equivalent to “H is a subgroup of G.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: H_set is a real set definition; no fake definitions are used.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat` bring in the necessary library and natural number namespace.
- The theorem `srdoty_alg_Z_n_901 {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n)` asserts for a positive natural number n:
  - First component: `(∀ a : ZMod n, IsUnit a ↔ Nat.gcd (ZMod.val a) n = 1)` says: for every congruence class a in Z/nZ, a is a unit if and only if gcd(val(a), n) = 1, where `ZMod.val a` denotes the canonical representative of a in {0, 1, ..., n-1}. This matches the standard criterion that a class is invertible mod n iff it is coprime to n.
  - Second component: `({a : ZMod n | IsUnit a} = {a : ZMod n | Nat.gcd (ZMod.val a) n = 1})` states equality of the subset of ZMod n consisting of units with the subset consisting of classes whose representative has gcd 1 with n. This is the set-level restatement of the first component.
- The hypothesis `hn : 0 < n` aligns with ""Let n be a positive integer"" and also ensures that `ZMod.val` is the standard representative in [0, n-1].

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The statement ""[a] ∈ ℤ_n is a unit iff gcd(a,n) = 1"" is captured exactly by the universal equivalence over `a : ZMod n`, using `Nat.gcd (ZMod.val a) n = 1`. The use of `ZMod.val a` is appropriate since the gcd condition is independent of the choice of representative.
- The ""Hence"" clause in the natural language identifying the set of units with those classes coprime to n is rendered as equality of sets `{a : ZMod n | IsUnit a}` and `{a : ZMod n | Nat.gcd (ZMod.val a) n = 1}`. This matches the intended meaning of ℤ_n^× as the subset of elements that are units.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the instructions, as we are auditing the statement, not its proof.
- The only subtlety is that natural language writes gcd(a, n) with a possibly integer representative, while Lean uses the canonical natural representative `ZMod.val a`. These are equivalent for the purpose of coprimality, so there is no semantic change.
- The set ℤ_n^× is colloquially the set of units; in Lean, `{a : ZMod n | IsUnit a}` is exactly that subset. So this is faithful.

- The natural language statement: For finite subgroups H and K of a group G with |H| = m, |K| = n, if gcd(m, n) = 1, then H ∩ K = {1}.
- Lean uses `H ⊓ K` for subgroup intersection and `⊥` for the trivial subgroup {1}. The typeclass `Fintype` enforces finiteness. Equalities `Fintype.card H = m` and `Fintype.card K = n` match the given sizes. Thus the theorem statement is exactly the same mathematically.

  - The quantification is over all such factorizations, without requiring that the primes p i be pairwise distinct or that this is the prime power factorization. This would assert the equality for any decomposition into prime powers, including ones that split a single prime power p^(k1+k2) as (p^k1)(p^k2), leading to a right-hand side p(k1)p(k2) rather than the intended p(k1+k2), which is generally different. So even if the placeholders were replaced by correct definitions, the statement as written is not faithful to the intended counting result.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- First clause: ""Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups."" The code’s first theorem captures this faithfully (modulo additive notation and allowing the external finite product); minor technical omission (ns i ≥ 1) is harmless since existence can choose positive ns.
- Second clause: ""If n = p1^k1 ... pr^kr is the prime power factorization of n, then the number of isomorphism classes ... is p(k1)...p(kr)."" The code introduces vacuous placeholders for the counting functions and states a theorem that quantifies over arbitrary prime-power decompositions without enforcing distinctness of primes or that the decomposition is the prime power factorization. Thus it does not faithfully formalize the condition ""prime power factorization"" and would claim the equality for decompositions where it is false. Moreover, the key auxiliary definitions are vacuous.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The first part is essentially correct.
- The second part is not faithful for two reasons: (a) uses vacuous placeholder definitions for the counting functions, and (b) lacks the necessary distinctness/prime-power-factorization condition, thereby mis-stating the scope of the counting formula. Even if the placeholders were fixed, the theorem’s hypotheses are too weak and would make the statement false as written.

Given these discrepancies, especially the vacuous definitions and the incorrect generality of the second theorem, the translation fails overall.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Sylow_394 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] {p : ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) (h_unique : Unique (Sylow p G)) :` sets up the theorem for a finite group G, a natural number p that is prime, and the hypothesis that the type of Sylow p-subgroups of G is Unique (i.e., there is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup).
- `∃ H : Sylow p G, ∀ (g : G) (x : G), x ∈ (H.1) → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ (H.1)` states that there exists a Sylow p-subgroup H of G such that for every g in G and every x in H, the conjugate g x g^{-1} is also in H. Here, `H.1` denotes the underlying subgroup of G associated to the Sylow structure H. This is precisely the standard invariance-under-conjugation condition for normality of the subgroup H in G.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: If G is finite and has exactly one Sylow p-subgroup, then that Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.
- The hypothesis `Unique (Sylow p G)` exactly captures “G has exactly one Sylow p-subgroup.”
- The conclusion is that there exists a Sylow p-subgroup H with the conjugation-invariance property, which is exactly the definition of normality for a subgroup. Given uniqueness, “there exists H with property P” is equivalent to “the unique Sylow p-subgroup has property P,” so this matches “that Sylow p-subgroup is normal.”
- The inclusion of `hp : Nat.Prime p` matches the mathematical context of Sylow p-subgroups depending on a prime p.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code expresses normality via the explicit conjugation-invariance condition rather than via a named predicate; this is standard and equivalent.
- The conclusion is phrased as an existence statement `∃ H : Sylow p G, ...`. Because of the `Unique (Sylow p G)` hypothesis, this is equivalent to asserting the unique Sylow p-subgroup is normal. No mismatch here.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the code relies on Mathlib's `Sylow p G` and standard group notions. The theorem is a direct formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the original mathematical statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem `permutations_conjugate_iff_same_cycle_type {n : ℕ} (σ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : IsConj σ τ ↔ σ.cycleType = τ.cycleType` states: For permutations σ and τ in S_n (represented as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`), σ is conjugate to τ if and only if their cycle types are equal. The proof is exactly `Equiv.Perm.isConj_iff_cycleType_eq` from Mathlib. This matches the first sentence of the natural language statement.

- The theorem `conjugacy_classes_biject_partitions {n : ℕ} : Nonempty (ConjClasses (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ≃ { m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n })` claims: There exists a bijection between conjugacy classes of S_n and the subtype of multisets of natural numbers whose sum is n. The comment suggests these are intended to be ""multisets of positive cycle lengths summing to n (i.e., partitions of n)"", but the actual type used is `Multiset ℕ` with the condition `sum = n`, which allows zeros.

- The theorem `num_conj_classes_eq_num_partitions {n : ℕ} [Fintype ({ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n } : Type _)] : Fintype.card (ConjClasses (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) = Fintype.card ({ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n } : Type _)` claims: Under the assumption that the target subtype is finite, the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of elements in `{ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }`. The intended justification is via `Fintype.card_congr` and the previous bijection. Proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- First part is faithful: Mathlib’s `isConj_iff_cycleType_eq` exactly captures “Two permutations in S_n are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type.”
- The key issues are in the second and third parts:
  - The code uses `{ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }` to represent “partitions of n”, but this is not correct. This subtype permits zeros, and different numbers of zeros produce different multisets with the same sum, so it does not correspond to integer partitions. Moreover, `Equiv.Perm.cycleType` in Mathlib omits 1-cycles (fixed points) and includes only lengths ≥ 2, with sum equal to the number of nonfixed points, not n. Thus a direct equivalence between conjugacy classes and `{ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }` is incorrect both because of the zero issue and because cycleType’s sum need not be n.
  - A faithful target would need to enforce positivity (exclude 0) and account for 1s (either explicitly include the right number of 1s so the sum is n, or otherwise encode the fixed-point count as n minus the sum of cycleType). In Mathlib, one could aim for something like `{ m : Multiset ℕ // (∀ a ∈ m, 0 < a) ∧ m.sum = n }` to represent integer partitions, or use a dedicated integer partition type if available.
  - The third theorem assumes a `Fintype` instance for `{ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }`. Given zeros are allowed, this type is actually infinite (there are infinitely many finite multisets with sum n by adding arbitrarily many zeros), so such an instance does not exist; the statement is therefore not only mismatched but also relies on a false assumption. Even if the target were corrected to a proper partition type, the existence of a finite cardinality would be fine, but the code as written does not achieve this.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The first theorem accurately matches the first sentence.
- The second and third claims in the Lean code do not faithfully formalize “partitions of n label the conjugacy classes” nor “the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of partitions of n.” The chosen type `{ m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }` is not the type of partitions of n, due to allowing zeros and not aligning with Mathlib’s definition of cycleType. Furthermore, the cardinality statement relies on an untenable finiteness assumption.

Therefore, the overall translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem name and docstring state the intended result: For a finite group G of order 2p with p an odd prime, G is isomorphic either to the cyclic group of order 2p or to the dihedral group of order 2p, expressed as a semidirect product Z_p ⋊ Z_2.
- Hypotheses: p : ℕ, hp : Nat.Prime p (p is prime), hodd : p ≠ 2 (so p is odd), G a type with [Group G] and [Fintype G] (a finite group), and h : Fintype.card G = 2 * p (|G| = 2p).
- Conclusion: Either there exists an isomorphism G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod (2 * p)) (i.e. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2p, represented as the additive group ZMod (2p) reinterpreted multiplicatively), or there exists a group homomorphism φ : Multiplicative (ZMod 2) →* MulAut (Multiplicative (ZMod p)) such that G ≃* SemidirectProduct (Multiplicative (ZMod p)) (Multiplicative (ZMod 2)) φ (i.e. G is isomorphic to a semidirect product Z_p ⋊_φ Z_2 for some action φ). The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Whole-statement comparison:
- Natural language: If |G| = 2p with p odd prime, then G ≅ Z_{2p} or D_p (the dihedral group of order 2p).
- Lean: If |G| = 2p with p prime and p ≠ 2, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 2p (Multiplicative (ZMod (2p))) or a semidirect product Z_p ⋊ Z_2 under some action φ.
- Dihedral group D_p is standardly presented as Z_p ⋊ Z_2 where Z_2 acts by inversion on Z_p. In this setting (p odd), homomorphisms Z_2 → Aut(Z_p) are exactly two: the trivial one (giving the direct product, which is cyclic since 2 and p are coprime) and the nontrivial one (inversion), yielding the dihedral group. Thus, “there exists φ such that G ≅ Z_p ⋊_φ Z_2” precisely captures the dihedral case (nontrivial φ) and also subsumes the cyclic case when φ is trivial; the disjunction also separately lists the cyclic case explicitly. Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully encodes the classification stated in natural language.

3) Final check and differences:
- Minor representational differences:
  - Z_{2p} is represented as Multiplicative (ZMod (2*p)), a standard Lean encoding of the cyclic group of order 2p.
  - D_p is represented implicitly as a semidirect product Z_p ⋊ Z_2 for some φ; although φ is not explicitly constrained to be the inversion automorphism, in the context p odd this exactly yields the dihedral group in the nontrivial case, and the theorem only needs existence of such an isomorphism. Hence this is a faithful formalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions (ZMod, Multiplicative, MulAut, SemidirectProduct, group isomorphisms), and the proof is omitted as allowed.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- hex captures nonemptiness. mul_closed captures closure under products. inv_closed encodes closure under inverses; while it is stated as existence of a right inverse B with A*B=I rather than explicitly A⁻¹ ∈ G, in the context of square matrices over a field (ℝ), A*B=I implies A and B are inverses and B = A⁻¹ (and also BA=I). Thus inv_closed is equivalent to “A⁻¹ ∈ G” in this setting. The conclusion 1 ∈ G matches “the identity matrix belongs to G.”
- The standard proof would pick A ∈ G by hex, then pick B ∈ G with A*B = I by inv_closed, then use mul_closed to note A*B ∈ G, hence I ∈ G. This matches the intended argument.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain: G is a subset of n×n real matrices—matches.
- Assumptions: nonempty and closed under multiplication and inverses—encoded as hex, mul_closed, inv_closed. The only subtle deviation is phrasing “inverse” via a right-inverse equation A*B=I. For matrices over ℝ, this is equivalent to B = A⁻¹, so there is no substantive mismatch.
- Conclusion: identity matrix in G—exactly 1 ∈ G.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the theorem is a direct translation of the statement with a standard, correct formulation in this context.

Hence, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- We fix a natural number n and work with permutations of Fin n (the set of n elements indexed 0..n-1).
- The theorem assumes:
  • hn: 6 ≤ n.
  • N: a subgroup of the full symmetric group on Fin n, i.e., N ≤ Sym(Fin n).
  • hN_mem_alt: every element of N is in the alternating group on Fin n (so N ≤ A_n).
  • hN_normal: for every σ ∈ A_n and every τ ∈ N, the conjugate σ τ σ⁻¹ lies in N (so N is normal in A_n).
  • hN_proper: N ≠ A_n (so N is a proper subgroup of A_n).
- Conclusion: For every i : Fin n, and for every σ ∈ A_n that fixes i (σ i = i), we have σ ∈ N.
  Equivalently, for each i, the set {σ ∈ A_n | σ(i) = i} is contained in N.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- Original: For n ≥ 6 and N a proper normal subgroup of A_n, show N contains each G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i} for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
- The Lean statement encodes exactly that: n ≥ 6; N ≤ A_n (hN_mem_alt); N normal in A_n (hN_normal); N ≠ A_n (hN_proper); and the conclusion is that for each i, any σ ∈ A_n fixing i lies in N, i.e., G_i ⊆ N.
- The code expresses the containment via elementwise implication rather than explicitly defining G_i as a subgroup; this is equivalent for the containment claim.

Step 3: Check for differences.
- Indexing: The natural language uses i ∈ {1, …, n}. Lean uses i : Fin n (indices 0..n−1). This is a harmless reindexing and standard in formalizations.
- Ambient group: N is a Subgroup of Sym(Fin n) with an inclusion N ≤ A_n specified by hN_mem_alt, and normality under A_n by hN_normal. This faithfully represents “N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n”.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all concepts come from Mathlib. The theorem is stated with an omitted proof (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- def G : Type := { M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // M 0 0 = M 1 1 ∧ M 0 1 = - M 1 0 }:
  This defines G as a subtype of 2×2 real matrices whose entries satisfy M(0,0) = M(1,1) and M(0,1) = −M(1,0). In concrete terms, any such matrix has the form [[a, −b], [b, a]] by taking a = M(0,0) and b = M(1,0); conversely, any matrix [[a, −b], [b, a]] satisfies these equations. So this matches the intended set G = { [a −b; b a] : a,b ∈ ℝ }.
- instance : AddCommGroup G := by sorry:
  This asserts that G, with inherited matrix addition, forms an additive commutative group. This is exactly “G is a group under matrix addition” (and even stronger: commutative, as matrix addition is commutative). The use of sorry means the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is correct and faithful.
- def complex_to_matrix (z : Complex) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...:
  This defines the map z = x + i y ↦ [[x, −y], [y, x]], written explicitly by case analysis on indices. That is the standard embedding of Complex into 2×2 real matrices representing complex addition/multiplication; here we only need additivity.
- def complex_add_equiv_G : AddEquiv Complex G := by sorry:
  This asserts an additive group isomorphism between (Complex, +) and G, i.e., an isomorphism of additive groups. The intended construction is precisely z ↦ [[Re z, −Im z], [Im z, Re z]] with the proof it lands in G and has an additive inverse map (e.g., matrix ↦ a + i b). Again, sorry omits the proof but the statement is exactly what’s requested.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The definition of G via equalities on entries is mathematically equivalent to the set of matrices of the form [[a, −b], [b, a]].
- The instance claims G is an additive commutative group under matrix addition, which is a strengthening of “group under matrix addition” and is entirely consistent.
- The isomorphism requested in the natural statement is precisely an additive group isomorphism (AddEquiv) between Complex and G, which the code declares.
- There are no fake or vacuous placeholder definitions like setting something to True; the only omissions are proofs (sorry), which are allowed under the instructions and do not alter the meaning of the statements.

Final check:
- Natural language: show G is a group under matrix addition, and construct an isomorphism (ℂ, +) ≅ G.
- Lean: defines G appropriately; asserts AddCommGroup instance (hence a group); declares an AddEquiv Complex G (the desired isomorphism). These are the same mathematical statements, with a standard construction provided for the forward map.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful and matches the original statement.

- Docstring: States the intent to assert that for n ≥ 2, the permutation group on Fin n is generated by the transposition (0 1) and an n-cycle, but this is just commentary.
- `open Equiv`: Open the Equiv namespace for permutations.

  In words: Given n ≥ 2, there exists a permutation σ of Fin n such that the subgroup generated by the two-element set {swap(0,1), σ} equals the whole symmetric group on Fin n. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: For n ≥ 2, Sym_n is generated by the set S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}. That is, the specific two elements (the transposition (1 2) and the n-cycle (1 2 ... n)) generate S_n.
- The Lean theorem asserts only the existence of some σ such that together with the transposition (0 1) they generate the whole group; it does not assert that σ is the standard n-cycle (0 1 2 ... n-1), nor even that σ is an n-cycle at all. It is strictly weaker and different in nature (existential vs. asserting a specific generating set).
- The indexing (Fin n uses 0..n-1 vs. 1..n) is acceptable and not an issue. The core issue is the missing specification that σ is the n-cycle.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The original fixes the set S with the explicit n-cycle. The Lean statement only says there exists some σ (unconstrained) that, together with (0 1), generates the group. Therefore, the formal statement does not faithfully capture the original.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the theorem is the only statement and it compiles (modulo the proof). However, the mathematical content is weaker than required, so the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient group is Perm (Fin n), i.e., the symmetric group S_n on n letters, represented as permutations of Fin n.
- alternatingGroup (Fin n) is the subgroup A_n of even permutations.
- Hypotheses:
  - hn : 6 ≤ n encodes n ≥ 6.
  - N : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n)) is a subgroup of S_n.
  - N_sub : ∀ g, g ∈ N → g ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) says N ⊆ A_n.
  - N_normal : ∀ a m, a ∈ A_n → m ∈ N → a * m * a⁻¹ ∈ N encodes that N is normal in A_n (conjugation by any a ∈ A_n keeps N inside N).
  - N_proper : N ≠ ⊤ asserts N is not the whole S_n. Note: ⊤ here is the top subgroup of Perm (Fin n), i.e., S_n.
  - i : Fin n fixes a particular element i ∈ {1,…,n}.
- Conclusion: ∀ σ : Perm (Fin n), σ ∈ A_n → σ i = i → σ ∈ N. This states that every even permutation σ fixing i lies in N, i.e., the point stabilizer G_i within A_n is contained in N: G_i ≤ N.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The conclusion in Lean exactly matches “N contains G_i”: it asserts that all σ ∈ A_n with σ(i) = i are in N.
- The normality and subgroup relations are correctly encoded: N is a subgroup of A_n and normal in A_n.
- The parameter i : Fin n corresponds to i ∈ {1,…,n}.
- The discrepancy: the natural language says “N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n,” meaning N ≠ A_n. In the Lean code, the “properness” hypothesis is N ≠ ⊤, i.e., N ≠ S_n. This is not the same. In particular, N = A_n satisfies N ≠ ⊤, so the Lean hypothesis allows N = A_n, whereas the original statement explicitly forbids N = A_n. Thus the code’s hypothesis is weaker (and not the intended one). This is a genuine mismatch in the formulation of “proper.”
- Additionally, the Lean statement includes this improper properness hypothesis but it is not used in the conclusion; nonetheless, as a translation of the problem specification, it is incorrect to say “proper in A_n” and encode “not equal to S_n.”

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Almost: all parts match except the properness condition. The Lean code expresses “N is normal in A_n and N ≠ S_n,” while the natural language requires “N is normal in A_n and N ≠ A_n.” This is a substantive but isolated mismatch. Everything else (n ≥ 6, fixing i, the target G_i ≤ N) is faithful.

Given this discrepancy, the translation is very close but not fully faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat`: bring in mathlib and open the natural numbers namespace.
- The theorem `zmod_units_cyclic_iff {n : ℕ} : IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ) ↔ ...` states an equivalence for each natural number n.
- Left-hand side: `IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ)` means the multiplicative group of units modulo n (i.e., Z_n^×) is cyclic, which is equivalent to saying there exists a primitive root (a generator) in that group.
- Right-hand side: a disjunction of cases:
  - `n = 2 ∨ n = 4` covers the small exceptional moduli.
  - `(∃ (p t : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ 1 ≤ t ∧ n = p ^ t)` says n is an odd prime power p^t with t ≥ 1 (since `p.Prime ∧ p ≠ 2` enforces p is an odd prime).
  - `(∃ (p t : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ 1 ≤ t ∧ n = 2 * p ^ t)` says n is twice an odd prime power, again with t ≥ 1.
- `by sorry` leaves the proof omitted; that does not affect the statement’s meaning.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: “There is a primitive root in the multiplicative group Z_n^× iff n = 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t, where p is an odd prime.” In group-theoretic terms, “there is a primitive root” is equivalent to the unit group being cyclic. The Lean statement is exactly this: `IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ)` iff n is one of 2, 4, an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power (with t ≥ 1). The conditions `p.Prime ∧ p ≠ 2` and `1 ≤ t` encode “p is an odd prime” and “t ≥ 1.” This is a direct and faithful formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only subtlety one might note in broader mathematical context is the n = 1 case: many sources include n = 1 as having a primitive root (the trivial group is cyclic), but the given natural language statement does not list n = 1, and the Lean code likewise does not include it on the right-hand side. The left-hand side is stated for all n, matching the natural language scope. Thus, as a translation of the provided statement, the Lean theorem matches it precisely.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful translation of the given natural language statement; no auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Use Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- def SL (n : ℕ) : Type _ := { A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // Matrix.det A = 1 }:
  This defines the type SL(n, ℝ) as the subtype of n×n real matrices with determinant 1. This matches the set SL(n) = {A in Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A = 1}.
- instance SL_group (n : ℕ) : Group (SL n) := by sorry:
  This declares that SL(n, ℝ) has a group structure, but it does not provide the structure; it's left as a placeholder (sorry). Also, it does not explicitly specify that the group operation is matrix multiplication.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement is: “Show that SL(n) = {A in Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A = 1} is a group under matrix multiplication.”
- The definition of SL is faithful: it exactly matches the set described.
- The group claim is stated via a typeclass instance Group (SL n), which corresponds to asserting a group structure on this set. However, the code does not specify that the group operation is matrix multiplication; this is only suggested by a comment. Formally, Group (SL n) alone does not guarantee the operation is inherited from matrix multiplication. Moreover, the instance is left as ‘sorry’, so the intended structure is not constructed in the code.

Step 3: Final comparison of the math problems.
- Same parts: The underlying set SL(n, ℝ) is correctly defined.
- Differences/Issues:
  1) The Lean statement does not enforce “under matrix multiplication”; it merely asserts the existence of some group structure on SL(n), with no formal link to matrix multiplication.
  2) The instance body is ‘sorry’, i.e., unprovided, so there is no actual construction ensuring closure, associativity, identity, and inverses come from matrix multiplication.

Conclusion: While very close in intent, the translation is not fully faithful because the essential clause “under matrix multiplication” is not encoded in the formal statement, and the instance is left as a placeholder. If the instance were implemented using the multiplication induced by matrix multiplication (and proofs of closure and inverses via det properties), it would be faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- Context: We work over a ring R and fix a size n (natural number). Matrices are n×n over R, indexed by Fin n.
- swap_matrix i j: This is the permutation matrix that swaps rows i and j (and leaves other rows as in the identity). Formally, it has 1 at positions (i, j) and (j, i), 1 on the diagonal elsewhere, and 0 otherwise.
- mul_row_matrix i k: This is the diagonal matrix with entry k at (i, i) and 1 on all other diagonal positions, 0 off-diagonal. It corresponds to multiplying row i by k.
- add_mul_rows_matrix i j k: This is the identity matrix except with entry k at position (j, i). Left-multiplying by this adds k times row i to row j.
- apply_swap A i j: The matrix obtained from A by swapping rows i and j.
- apply_mul_row A i k: The matrix obtained from A by multiplying row i by k.
- apply_add_mul_rows A i j k: The matrix obtained from A by adding k times row i to row j.
- swap_rows_eq_mul: States that applying the row swap to A equals left-multiplying A by swap_matrix i j.
- mul_row_eq_mul: States that multiplying row i of A by k equals left-multiplying A by mul_row_matrix i k.
- add_mul_rows_eq_mul: States that adding k times row i to row j in A equals left-multiplying A by add_mul_rows_matrix i j k.

Step 2: Compare the whole translation to the original statement.
The original statement says: for any positive integer n, if B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, then B = U A where U is the corresponding elementary n×n matrix of the same type. The Lean code provides explicit definitions of the three elementary row operations and their corresponding matrices, and then asserts in three theorems that for each operation, the resulting matrix equals the corresponding elementary matrix times A. This exactly matches the content of the natural language statement, split casewise.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Scope of n: The Lean code allows any n : Nat, including n = 0. The natural language says positive integer n. This is a harmless generalization.
- Scalar k in row-scaling: The code allows any k ∈ R (including k = 0), while some conventions for “elementary row operation” and “elementary matrix” require k ≠ 0 so that the matrix is invertible. The equality B = U A still holds for any k; thus the Lean version is a slight generalization and not a restriction. The statement about existence of U of the same type remains correct.
- i and j may be equal in the code (degenerate cases), again a harmless generalization.
- The code does not use Mathlib’s built-in “elementary matrix” type but defines the corresponding matrices explicitly and correctly. There are no vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful and standard.
- Proofs are omitted with sorry, but per the task we only audit the statements/definitions for faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully capture the original claim, case-by-case, with minor generalizations that are acceptable under the guidelines.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and states two theorems about additive groups representing the classification of cyclic groups.

1) `theorem infinite_cyclic_add_group_equiv_Z {A : Type _} [AddGroup A] (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative A)) (hn : ¬Finite A) : Nonempty (A ≃+ Int)`
- A is a type with an additive group structure.
- `IsCyclic (Multiplicative A)` says that the additive group A is cyclic (by viewing it as a multiplicative group via the `Multiplicative` type synonym).
- `¬Finite A` says A is not finite (i.e., infinite).
- Conclusion: There exists an additive group isomorphism (an additive equivalence) between A and ℤ, expressed as `Nonempty (A ≃+ Int)`.
This matches the statement: any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ.

2) `theorem finite_cyclic_add_group_equiv_ZMod {A : Type _} [AddGroup A] (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative A)) [Finite A] : ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ Nonempty (A ≃+ ZMod n)`
- A is a type with an additive group structure.
- `IsCyclic (Multiplicative A)` again asserts A is cyclic as an additive group.
- `[Finite A]` says A is finite.
- Conclusion: There exists a natural number n with `0 < n` such that A is additively isomorphic to `ZMod n`.
This matches the statement: any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ/nℤ for some positive integer n.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The use of `Multiplicative A` is a standard device in Mathlib to express cyclicity of an additive group using the multiplicative `IsCyclic`. This accurately captures “A is cyclic (as an additive group).”
- Using `¬Finite A` to express “infinite” is acceptable (classically equivalent to `Infinite A`). The natural language says “infinite,” and the code uses “not finite,” which is faithful.
- The codomain groups are `Int` (ℤ) with its additive structure and `ZMod n` (ℤ/nℤ), precisely as in the statement.
- The second theorem correctly enforces `0 < n` to ensure a positive modulus, matching “for some positive integer n.”
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements with `sorry` proofs (allowed per instructions) are given.
- The theorems are stated exactly for the case of additive groups, which is consistent with the phrasing of the target groups (ℤ and ℤ/nℤ are presented as additive groups). This is a faithful formulation of the original group-theoretic statements.

Final check:
- The math problems are the same: classification of cyclic groups into isomorphic copies of ℤ (infinite case) and ℤ/nℤ (finite case). The Lean statements match both parts with appropriate hypotheses and conclusions.
- No discrepancies found.

- The left side, `Ring R`, is precisely the standard Mathlib notion of a (not-necessarily commutative) ring: additive commutative group with multiplicative monoid and distributive laws.
- The right side decomposes that into: `AddCommGroup R` (i.e., (R, +) is an abelian group with identity 0), `Monoid R` (i.e., (R, ·) is a monoid with identity 1), and explicitly lists both left and right distributive laws for all a, b, c ∈ R.
- This matches exactly the natural language statement’s three conditions.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The natural language wants: R is a ring iff (1) (R,+) abelian group with 0, (2) (R,·) monoid with 1, (3) distributivity on both sides. The Lean statement is exactly that.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib classes/properties. The theorem is a pure equivalence statement, consistent with the intended meaning.
- Minor typeclass elaboration details (like how + and * are supplied) are standard in Mathlib and do not change the mathematical content of the statement.

  • (2) is encoded in B, C, D, G (associativity, identity, commutativity, inverses) together with E; these imply that the nonzero elements form an abelian group with identity 1. The code states these properties globally (for all elements), which is stronger than needed but consistent with fields.

- Differences / issues:
  • LHS uses Nonempty (Field F), not [Field F] or an unbundled property tying to the given operations. This asserts the existence of some field structure on F (possibly with different +, *, 0, 1 than those in scope). The natural statement says “F is a field” specifically with the given + and ·. This is a significant mismatch: the code’s LHS is existential about a structure, not about the fixed operations.
  • For addition, the RHS uses Nonempty (AddCommGroup F) rather than asserting that the existing +, 0, − operations make F into an abelian group. As with the LHS issue, this only asserts the existence of some additive abelian group structure on F and does not tie it to the [Add F], [Zero F], [Neg F] provided in the context.
  • The code explicitly includes global associativity and identity laws for multiplication (B, C), and global commutativity (D), whereas the natural statement encodes these only for the nonzero subset via (2). This is a strengthening but not a problem for the forward direction (field ⇒ axioms) and is derivable from (2)+(4)+(1) for cases involving zero, so conceptually acceptable as a reformulation. However, it differs syntactically from “(F\{0}, ·) is an abelian group” by replacing the subset-group statement with global axioms plus the inverse-existence restricted to nonzero elements.
  • Closure of multiplication on F\{0} is not explicitly stated but can be derived from the other axioms (using inverses and distributivity to show a*0 = 0), so this is acceptable.

Step 3: Are the two statements the same?
- No, primarily because of the Nonempty wrappers:
  • The LHS “Nonempty (Field F)” does not ensure that the field structure uses the given +, *, 0, 1; it only asserts there exists some field structure on F. The natural statement requires that the given operations make F a field.
  • Similarly, the RHS “Nonempty (AddCommGroup F)” does not ensure the given +,0,− are the ones making F an abelian group; it only asserts existence of some additive abelian group structure.
- The rest of the RHS conditions for multiplication and distributivity do refer to the given * and +, but because the addition condition is existential and the field on the LHS is existential, the equivalence does not faithfully capture “with the given operations.”

Conclusion: The Lean statement is close in spirit but not a faithful translation. To be faithful, it should tie all properties to the given operations (e.g., use [AddCommGroup F] and state [Field F] rather than Nonempty, or use an unbundled Prop like IsField with the current operations).

Grade rationale: Significant mismatch due to the use of Nonempty for both Field and AddCommGroup makes the equivalence about existence of some structures rather than the given operations; otherwise, the rest is a reasonable reformulation. Hence not faithful, but close: 8/10.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Matrix: Using Mathlib and opening the Matrix namespace.
- def O (n : Nat) : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := { A | A * Aᵀ = 1 }:
  This defines O(n) as the set of n×n real matrices A such that A times its transpose equals the identity matrix. This matches the natural-language definition O(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(R) : AA^T = I}.
- theorem O_is_group (n : Nat) : (1 ∈ O n) ∧ (∀ A B, A ∈ O n → B ∈ O n → A * B ∈ O n) ∧ (∀ A, A ∈ O n → Aᵀ ∈ O n):
  This states three properties:
  1) The identity matrix 1 is in O(n).
  2) O(n) is closed under multiplication: if A and B are in O(n), then AB is in O(n).
  3) For any A in O(n), its transpose Aᵀ is also in O(n).
  The comment says: “identity is in O(n), O(n) is closed under multiplication, and the transpose gives inverses.” Given the definition of O(n), property (3) implies Aᵀ A = I (since Aᵀ ∈ O(n) means Aᵀ (Aᵀ)ᵀ = Aᵀ A = I). Combined with A ∈ O(n) giving AAᵀ = I, this shows Aᵀ is indeed the two-sided inverse of A.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The natural language statement asks to prove that O(n) = {A : AA^T = I} is a group under matrix multiplication, using the facts (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T. In a formalization, to show “is a group under matrix multiplication,” one typically verifies:
- associativity (inherited from matrices),
- identity in the set,
- closure under multiplication,
- existence of inverses in the set.
The Lean theorem asserts identity ∈ O(n), closure under multiplication, and that for any A ∈ O(n), Aᵀ ∈ O(n). Together with the definition of membership (AAᵀ = I), this indeed implies inverses: AAᵀ = I and AᵀA = I, so Aᵀ is the inverse of A. Associativity is ambient. Thus the statement captures exactly the needed properties to conclude O(n) forms a group under matrix multiplication. The code does not explicitly mention (AB)^{-1} or (AB)^T, but those would be used in a proof; the absence of proof details does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Definition of O(n): matches exactly (AAᵀ = I over real n×n matrices).
- Goal: show O(n) is a group under multiplication: the Lean theorem specifies identity, closure, and “transpose gives inverses,” which is sufficient to conclude a group structure using ambient associativity. This is a faithful formal counterpart of the natural language statement.
- No vacuous placeholders: O is a genuine definition; no fake predicates. The theorem uses sorry for proof, which is allowed per instructions.
No substantive differences were found.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem fixes a natural number p with hp : p.Prime, a type G with instances [CommGroup G] and [Fintype G], and an assumption hpg : IsPGroup p G (so G is a finite abelian p-group in the intended sense).
- The conclusion states: For every subgroup H of G, if H is a simple group (IsSimpleGroup (↥H)), then there exists a group isomorphism H ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod p). Here ZMod p is the additive cyclic group of order p, and Multiplicative (ZMod p) turns it into a multiplicative group so it matches the multiplicative structure of G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement concerns composition factors of a finite abelian p-group, i.e., the simple subquotients appearing in a composition series (successive quotients Hᵢ/Hᵢ₊₁ where the chain is normal; in abelian groups, all subgroups are normal).
- The Lean statement does not mention composition series nor quotients. Instead, it quantifies over simple subgroups H ≤ G and asserts H ≅ ZMod p (as a multiplicative group). While it is true that any simple subgroup of an abelian p-group has order p and is isomorphic to Z/pZ, this is not the same as asserting that all composition factors (simple quotients Hᵢ/Hᵢ₊₁) are Z/pZ.
- In general, composition factors are simple subquotients, not necessarily realized as subgroups of G. Although for abelian groups the composition factors are indeed cyclic of prime order, the formalization should speak about simple quotients (subquotients) rather than simple subgroups. The current code misses the quotient aspect entirely.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: Every composition factor (simple subquotient in a composition series) of a finite abelian p-group is isomorphic to Z_p.
- Lean: Every simple subgroup of a finite abelian p-group is isomorphic to Z_p.
- Difference: Subquotients vs subgroups. The code states a weaker property and does not capture the notion of composition factors. No vacuous definitions are made, and the use of Multiplicative (ZMod p) is a reasonable structural choice, but the central concept (composition factors) is not formalized.

Given this, the translation is not faithful, though it is closely related and a natural weakening of the intended statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and Matrix namespace.
- `variable (n : ℕ)`: fix a natural number n for n×n matrices.
- `def O_mat : Set ((Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)ˣ) := {U | (U : Matrix ...)ᵀ * (U : Matrix ...) = 1 }`
  This defines O(n) as the set of units (invertible matrices) whose underlying matrix A satisfies Aᵀ A = I. That is the usual orthogonality condition. Modeling O(n) as a subset of the units is consistent with the notion of a matrix group.
- `def SO_set : Set ((Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)ˣ) := {U | (U : Matrix ...)ᵀ * (U : Matrix ...) = 1 ∧ (U : Matrix ...).det = 1 }`
  This defines SO(n) as the subset of such units additionally having determinant 1. This indeed matches {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1}.
- `def SO_is_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)ˣ) := by sorry`
  This purports to give a subgroup of the units but supplies no construction (it is a placeholder). Moreover, it does not even state that the subgroup’s carrier is `SO_set`; it is just an arbitrary subgroup with no connection to `SO_set`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The statement to prove is that SO(n) = {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group, i.e., that this set forms a subgroup of the invertible matrices (or GL(n, ℝ)). The code correctly defines the sets O(n) and SO(n) as subsets of the units via the usual orthogonality and determinant conditions. However, the crucial part—showing that SO(n) is a subgroup—is not provided: `SO_is_subgroup` is left as `sorry` and, worse, is not tied to `SO_set` at all. Thus the code does not actually assert or prove that the specific set `SO_set` is a subgroup.

3) Final check and differences:
- Positive: The set definition of SO(n) matches {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} and is modeled as a subset of invertible matrices, which is appropriate for a matrix group.
- Negative: The subgroup structure is missing (uses `sorry`). Additionally, the declared `Subgroup` is not even linked to `SO_set` in its statement, so even if `sorry` were replaced by something, the current code does not state that the subgroup carrier is `SO_set`.
These issues mean the code does not faithfully translate or complete the requested proof.

Given that the auxiliary placeholder is present and the final crucial assertion is not made, the translation fails. If the `sorry` were replaced by a proper subgroup structure whose carrier is `SO_set`, the approach would be faithful.

- `open Matrix` just opens the Matrix namespace for convenience.

- The theorem statement exactly matches “Show that E(s)E(t) = E(s+t) for all s,t∈F”.

  This states: For any natural n, any real n×n matrix A indexed by Fin n, if Aᵀ A = I (the identity matrix), then for all indices i, j, the entry-wise formula holds: the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise. This is exactly the statement (Aᵀ A)_{i j} = δ_{i j}, which is the orthonormality of the columns of A.

- The natural language says: Suppose A ∈ O(n) with columns A_i ∈ ℝ^n. Prove that the columns are orthonormal, i.e., the dot product of columns i and j equals δ_{ij}.
- In Mathlib terms, A ∈ O(n) for real matrices is equivalent to Aᵀ A = I. The theorem assumes h : A.transpose * A = 1 and concludes exactly that ∑_k A_{k i} A_{k j} = if i = j then 1 else 0, which is the dot product of columns i and j equals δ_{ij}.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  States: For a natural number n, on the real vector space (Fin n → ℝ) equipped with some inner product structure, and for a real n×n matrix A satisfying Aᵀ A = I, we conclude the following.
- Conclusion: `Orthonormal ℝ (fun i => A.col i) ∧ (Submodule.span ℝ (Set.range (fun i => A.col i)) = ⊤)`
  This says: (i) the family of columns of A (indexed by i : Fin n) is orthonormal over ℝ; and (ii) the ℝ-linear span of the set of these columns is the whole space, i.e., they span the entire (Fin n → ℝ). Together, this characterizes that the columns form an orthonormal basis.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let A ∈ O(n) with columns A₁, …, Aₙ. Deduce that {A₁, …, Aₙ} is an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ.
- Interpreting A ∈ O(n): over ℝ, membership in O(n) is equivalent to Aᵀ A = I (no determinant condition beyond ±1 is needed). The code uses `h : Aᵀ * A = 1`, which matches this.
- Conclusion: The code asserts both orthonormality of the columns and that they span the whole space, which is exactly the statement that the columns form an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ.

3) Differences and issues:
- The key subtlety is the inner product instance. The theorem universally quantifies over `[InnerProductSpace ℝ (Fin n → ℝ)]`, i.e., it must hold for any inner product on (Fin n → ℝ). However, the equation `Aᵀ * A = 1` is the orthogonality condition with respect to the standard dot product (as realized by the usual transpose/matrix multiplication). Orthonormality in the conclusion is computed with respect to the provided inner product instance. If that instance is not the standard Euclidean inner product, the conclusion can fail. Thus, the Lean statement is strictly stronger than the intended natural language statement, which is about the standard Euclidean inner product on ℝⁿ.
- Everything else matches well: the use of columns `A.col i`, the span equals top, and no extra (e.g. determinant) conditions are imposed, which is correct for O(n).

Conclusion: The only discrepancy is the universal quantification over arbitrary inner products; the theorem should fix the space to be the standard Euclidean space (e.g., use `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` or rely on the canonical instance without universally quantifying it). Because of this mismatch, the translation is not fully faithful, though it is very close.

  This states: For any real n×n matrix A that is a unit (invertible), there exists a list E of matrices such that every member of E is elementary (under the above predicate) and A equals the product of the matrices in E (folded right with multiplication and identity 1). Proof omitted.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Any nonsingular (i.e., invertible) n×n real matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices. The theorem uses IsUnit A, which is equivalent to invertibility/nonsingularity for square real matrices, so that part matches.
- The product expression via a list and fold is a standard formalization of “product of elementary matrices.”
- However, the crucial issue is the definition of the “elementary matrices.” Scale and shear are correctly defined. The swap_matrix is intended to be the row-swap permutation matrix, but its formula is incorrect. Specifically, when r = j (row j), it returns 1 both when c = i and when r = c (i.e., c = j), thus placing two ones in row j for i ≠ j. A proper swap matrix should have exactly one 1 in each row/column, with row j having a single 1 at column i. Therefore swap_matrix as defined is not the standard row-swapping elementary matrix. Consequently, the inductive predicate is_elementary_matrix includes an incorrect “swap” matrix, and does not capture the true swap elementary matrices. This means the set of matrices declared “elementary” in the code differs from the standard notion.
- Because the theorem quantifies over matrices satisfying this flawed is_elementary_matrix, the formal statement is not the same as the intended mathematical statement (it asserts a factorization into a different class of matrices).

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Different. While scale and shear match, the swap matrix is misdefined, so the class of “elementary matrices” in the Lean code is not the standard one. Hence the theorem, even though it has the right overall form and uses invertibility, does not faithfully state the original claim.

Other notes:
- There are no vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are concrete. The issue is correctness of the swap definition.
- Using IsUnit vs. nonsingular is fine over ℝ.

Given this discrepancy, the translation is not faithful.

Without any Lean code, there is no formal statement or definition present that could correspond to this claim.

3) Final check: The two math problems are different in the sense that one is a concrete mathematical statement about permutations, while the other (absent) provides no content. Therefore, the translation fails vacuously.

- def gl ... : Set (Matrix n n R) := { A | IsUnit A }: Defines GL(n) as the set of n×n matrices over a commutative ring R that are units in the matrix ring, i.e., invertible. This matches the usual notion of GL(n).
- def o ... : Set (Matrix n n R) := { A | A * A.transpose = 1 }: Defines O(n) as the set of matrices whose transpose is a right-inverse, i.e., A Aᵀ = I.

- theorem orthogonal_group_eq_gl ... : o R n = { A | A ∈ gl R n ∧ A * A.transpose = 1 }: States that the set of matrices satisfying A Aᵀ = I equals the set of matrices that are invertible and satisfy A Aᵀ = I.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Prove that O(n) = {A ∈ GL(n) : A A^T = I}.
- The code defines O(n) as {A | A Aᵀ = I} and GL(n) as {A | IsUnit A}. The theorem asserts O(n) equals {A | A ∈ GL(n) ∧ A Aᵀ = I}.
- Since A Aᵀ = I already implies A is invertible (hence IsUnit A) for square matrices over a commutative ring, both sets are equal. Thus the formal statement matches the natural language statement exactly.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The code is a slight generalization (works over any commutative ring R and an arbitrary finite index type n rather than Nat), which is acceptable. No vacuous placeholders are used; all auxiliary definitions are legitimate Mathlib notions. The use of A * A.transpose = 1 (right inverse) suffices in this context and is standard for orthogonality.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `def H0 : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) R := ...`: Defines the 2×2 matrix H0 = diag(1, -1), i.e., the reflection across the x-axis.
- The theorem `reflect_x_axis_conjugates_to_SO` states: Let H be a 2×2 matrix over R with Hᵀ H = I (orthogonality) and det H = -1 (improper).

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]; {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]: We work over a commutative ring R and an index type n that is finite and has decidable equality. This sets up the context for n×n matrices over R.
- def diagonal_invertible_matrices : Set (Matrix n n R) := {A | ∃ d : n → R, (∀ i, IsUnit (d i)) ∧ A = Matrix.diagonal d}: This defines the set of matrices that are diagonal with all diagonal entries units in R. In other words, this is the set of diagonal matrices which are invertible (since a diagonal matrix is invertible iff each diagonal entry is a unit).
- def diagonal_invertible_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) := by sorry: This claims to define a subgroup of the units of the matrix ring (i.e., GL(n,R) viewed as Units (Matrix n n R)), supposedly the subgroup consisting of diagonal invertible matrices. However, it uses `by sorry` to produce an element of type Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) with no construction. It also does not reference the previously defined set `diagonal_invertible_matrices` and does not specify the carrier of the subgroup or prove closure properties. This is a vacuous placeholder.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement: “Let D(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in GL(n). Show that D(n) is a matrix group.” Formally, one should define D(n) as the subset of GL(n) consisting of diagonal (invertible) matrices, and then prove that this subset is a subgroup (i.e., a matrix group).

What the code does:
- It defines a set of matrices `diagonal_invertible_matrices` as diagonal matrices with unit diagonal entries. This indeed matches the “diagonal matrices in GL(n)” but as a subset of `Matrix n n R` rather than of `Units (Matrix n n R)` (GL(n)). A bridge is needed to view these as elements of GL(n), which is not provided.
- It then attempts to define a subgroup of `Units (Matrix n n R)` via `by sorry`, without tying it to `diagonal_invertible_matrices`, and without any content. This is vacuous and does not establish that D(n) forms a subgroup.

Thus the code does not faithfully translate the statement: it neither defines D(n) as a subset of GL(n) nor proves it is a subgroup; instead it gives a placeholder `def` with `sorry` that could denote any subgroup.

Step 3: Differences and issues
- Major issue: The subgroup is introduced via `by sorry`, making it a vacuous, arbitrary subgroup with no relation to diagonal matrices. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- Type mismatch: `diagonal_invertible_matrices` is a set of matrices, while the subgroup is of units; there is no map/embedding given to relate the two, nor is the intended subgroup’s carrier specified.
- Acceptable generalization: Working over a commutative ring R, and using `Units (Matrix n n R)` to represent GL(n), is a reasonable and common generalization. This is fine.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the vacuous subgroup definition and missing linkage to the defined set. If the subgroup were properly defined as {u : Units (Matrix n n R) | ∃ d, (∀ i, IsUnit (d i)) ∧ (u : Matrix) = diagonal d} and closure proven, it would be faithful. As written, it fails.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The environment imports Mathlib and sets up universes u, v. No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced.
- Parameters: `n : Type u` with `[DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]` and `R : Type v` with `[CommRing R]`. In Mathlib, `GL n R` denotes the general linear group of invertible linear maps on the `R`-module of functions `n → R`, which corresponds to invertible n×n matrices (with rows/columns indexed by the finite type `n`). The decidable equality and finiteness are standard technical requirements in Mathlib for matrix/GL constructions.
- Hypotheses: `G H : Subgroup (GL n R)`. This formalizes “matrix groups G, H ⊆ GL(n, R)” as subgroups of the general linear group.
- Statement: `∃ (K : Subgroup (GL n R)), (K : Set (GL n R)) = (G : Set (GL n R)) ∩ (H : Set (GL n R))`. This asserts that there exists a subgroup K of `GL n R` whose underlying set is exactly the set-theoretic intersection of the underlying sets of `G` and `H`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: given matrix groups G and H (subgroups of GL(n)), the intersection G ∩ H is again a matrix group. In formal terms, that means the set-theoretic intersection is itself a subgroup of GL(n).
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: there exists a subgroup K whose carrier set equals `G ∩ H`. This is precisely the formal way to say the intersection is a subgroup (i.e., a matrix group). In Mathlib one could take `K = G ⊓ H`, whose carrier is indeed the intersection, but the existential formulation is equivalent to the claim.

Comparing details:
- The code works over a commutative ring `R` and a finite index type `n`, which is a standard formalization of “n×n matrices over R”. The English statement omits the ground ring/field, but the property holds in this specialized context; this is a harmless specialization, acceptable under the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only a theorem statement with an unfinished proof (which is acceptable per the task instructions).
- The equality is at the level of sets, which is the right notion for saying the set-theoretic intersection forms a subgroup.

Final check:
- The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical content: intersection of two subgroups of GL(n, R) is a subgroup of GL(n, R), i.e., a matrix group.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {F : Type*} [Field F]`: Let F be a field.
- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Define the 2×2 matrix E(t) over F by specifying its entries using indices i, j ∈ {0,1}. The branches give:
  - E(t)₀₀ = 1
  - E(t)₀₁ = t
  - E(t)₁₀ = 0
  - E(t)₁₁ = 1
  So E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]].
- `theorem E_mul_Eneg (t : F) : E t * E (-t) = 1 := ...`: States that for all t, E(t) multiplied by E(−t) equals the identity matrix. The comment notes this is equivalent to E(t)⁻¹ = E(−t).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For all t ∈ F, with E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]], show E(t)⁻¹ = E(−t). The code defines exactly that E(t) and states E(t) * E(−t) = I. Over a field, having a right inverse implies invertibility and that right inverse is the actual inverse, so E(t) * E(−t) = I is equivalent to E(t)⁻¹ = E(−t). Thus the theorem statement matches the intended mathematical content.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code proves the right-inverse identity E(t) E(−t) = I rather than explicitly writing (E t)⁻¹ = E (−t). Over a field, these are equivalent statements, so this is not a substantive difference.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; `E` is properly defined, and the theorem states the correct property.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

This instance does not specify that the group operation is inherited from matrix multiplication; it merely asserts the existence of some group structure on this type.

2) Does this faithfully express the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: ""Show that GL(n) = {A in Mat_{n×n}(R) : det A ≠ 0} is a group under matrix multiplication"" over R = ℝ.
- Differences and issues:
  - Ground ring/field: The statement is about real matrices ℝ, where det ≠ 0 is equivalent to invertibility and the set is indeed a group under matrix multiplication. The Lean code generalizes to an arbitrary commutative ring R, which is not a harmless generalization: over a general commutative ring with zero divisors, nonzero determinants are not closed under multiplication (det A ≠ 0 and det B ≠ 0 can still yield det(AB) = 0), and matrices with det ≠ 0 need not be invertible. Thus the set is not a group in general. So the generalized statement is false.
  - Operation specificity: The natural language explicitly says ""under matrix multiplication."" The Lean code provides an opaque `Group` instance via `sorry` and does not tie the group operation to matrix multiplication. As written, it merely asserts the existence of some group structure (which could be unrelated to matrix multiplication), so it does not faithfully encode the intended operation.
  - Use of `sorry`: The group instance is supplied entirely by `sorry`, so no structure (mul, one, inv) is actually defined. This makes the assertion vacuous and does not capture the intended content. The guidelines require that auxiliary definitions not be vacuous; here, the key assertion (the group structure) is vacuous.
- On the positive side, the definition `GL_subtype` does match the described set {A : det A ≠ 0}.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code asserts a broadly generalized and, in general, false statement (for arbitrary commutative rings), and it does not ensure the group operation is matrix multiplication. Moreover, the group structure is left entirely as a placeholder (`sorry`). Therefore, the translation is not faithful to the original statement about ℝ and matrix multiplication.

Grade rationale:
- While the set definition is correct, the crucial part (group under matrix multiplication) is not captured: the instance is vacuous and not tied to the intended operation, and the generalization to arbitrary commutative rings is incorrect. This merits a low score. A 3 reflects that there is a meaningful piece (the set) but the main statement is not faithfully encoded and is provided via a vacuous instance.

- Conclusion: (M * N).transpose * (M * N) = 1 ∧ (M * N).det = 1: The product MN is orthogonal and has determinant +1. This exactly characterizes MN being in SO(2), i.e., a rotation matrix.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Show that the product of any two reflection matrices in O(2) is a rotation matrix (i.e., an element of SO(2)).”
- The Lean theorem assumes M and N are in O(2) (via Mᵀ M = I and Nᵀ N = I) and are reflections (via determinant −1), and concludes MN is in SO(2) (orthogonal and determinant +1). This is precisely the mathematical content of the statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem srdoty_alg_perm_gps_805 (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :` sets up the statement for a natural number n with n ≥ 1.
- `∀ (t : List (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))),` quantifies over all finite lists t of permutations of `Fin n` (i.e., elements of S_n modeled on {0, ..., n-1}).
- `(∀ τ ∈ t, ∃ a b : Fin n, τ = Equiv.swap a b) ->` assumes that each permutation τ in the list t is a swap `Equiv.swap a b` for some `a, b : Fin n`. Note: this does not impose `a ≠ b`.
- `List.prod t = 1 ->` assumes the product (in the group of permutations) of the list t equals the identity permutation.
- `t.length % 2 = 0` concludes that the number of factors (the length of the list) is even.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The intended mathematical statement: In S_n, any factorization of the identity as a product of transpositions (2-cycles swapping two distinct elements) has even length.
- The Lean code matches most aspects: working in S_n (`Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`), factorization as a list product equals identity, conclusion is that the length is even.
- Key discrepancy: In the code, a “transposition” is represented by `Equiv.swap a b` without the condition `a ≠ b`. But `Equiv.swap a a = 1` (the identity). In standard mathematics, a transposition means swapping two distinct elements. Allowing `a = b` admits identity factors as “transpositions,” which is not faithful to the usual definition.

Why this matters:
- Because the code allows `a = b`, there are counterexamples to the Lean statement: for n ≥ 1, take any `a : Fin n` and let `t = [Equiv.swap a a]`. Then each element of t is of the required form, `List.prod t = 1`, but `t.length = 1`, which is odd. This contradicts the conclusion `t.length % 2 = 0`. Thus, the Lean proposition is actually false as stated, whereas the natural language statement is true (with distinctness required).

Other observations:
- Using `Fin n` instead of `{1, ..., n}` is a harmless standard formalization choice.
- The hypothesis `1 ≤ n` is consistent with the natural-language statement (some versions even allow n = 0, but this is not an issue).

Final check:
- The mathematical problems are not the same: the Lean code fails to require `a ≠ b` in each swap, which is essential in the notion of a transposition. This makes the formal statement strictly stronger (and in fact false) compared to the intended statement. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

The original natural language statement asks to show that the group with presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to Z_2. The Lean theorem proves (or rather, states) only a key lemma: that under those relations in an arbitrary group, a must be the identity. This is indeed a crucial step toward the isomorphism result, since it implies that the presented group collapses to ⟨b | b^2 = 1⟩, i.e., Z_2. However, the Lean statement does not itself assert or construct the presented group nor the isomorphism to Z_2. It neither mentions the universal property of the presented group nor concludes that the group is isomorphic to Z_2.

- The code omits the explicit isomorphism conclusion. It proves only a necessary lemma (""a is trivial under the relations"") but not the full isomorphism statement.
- The code does not define or refer to the presented group. 
- There are no vacuous placeholders; the statement is legitimate and meaningful, just incomplete relative to the original claim.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation of the full statement, but a strong and relevant step toward it. Hence not faithful, but close.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the Mathlib library.
- `variable {G H : Type _} [Group G] [Group H]`: Work with arbitrary types G and H equipped with group structures.
- `def phi : G →* G × H := { toFun := fun x => (x, (1 : H)), map_one' := by simp, map_mul' := by simp }`: Define φ as a group (monoid) homomorphism from G to the product group G × H. The function is φ(x) = (x, 1_H). The fields `map_one'` and `map_mul'` certify that φ(1) = (1,1) and φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y), i.e., φ is a homomorphism.
- `theorem phi_injective_hom : Function.Injective (phi : G → G × H) := by sorry`: State that φ is injective as a function from G to G × H. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for the purpose of translation.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that the map φ: G → G × H given by φ(x) = (x,1) is an injective homomorphism.
- The code defines exactly that map as a group homomorphism (via `G →* G × H`) and separately states that it is injective. Together, this exactly matches “injective homomorphism.”

Checks for issues:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: φ is concretely defined; no fake predicates are used.
- The use of `G →* G × H` is appropriate and standard in Mathlib for group/monoid homomorphisms.
- The theorem only asserts injectivity; the homomorphism property is encoded by the type and definition of φ, which aligns with the statement.

Conclusion:
- The formalization is a faithful translation of the given natural language statement. The two problems are the same.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and Matrix namespace.
- Comment explains the intent: define the elementary matrix obtained by adding t times row j to row i, and show its determinant is 1, hence it lies in SL(n).
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem elementary_add_row_mem_SL {n : ℕ} (i j : Fin n) (h : i ≠ j) (t : ℝ) :
    Matrix.det ((1 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) + Matrix.single i j t) = 1 := by sorry`
  In words: For any natural number n, indices i, j in {0, ..., n-1} with i ≠ j, and real t, the determinant of the matrix I + t·e_{ij} (where `Matrix.single i j t` is the matrix with t at position (i, j) and 0 elsewhere) equals 1.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language defines E_{ij}(t) as the elementary matrix obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i. In matrix form, this is exactly I + t·e_{ij} with i ≠ j.
- The statement to prove is E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n). In Mathlib, SL(n, ℝ) (SpecialLinearGroup) is defined as matrices with determinant 1. Thus proving det(E_{ij}(t)) = 1 is equivalent to showing E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n, ℝ).
- The code asserts det(I + single i j t) = 1 under the hypothesis i ≠ j and t ∈ ℝ, which matches the content needed to conclude membership in SL(n).
- Indexing: The natural language uses 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n; Lean uses `Fin n` (0-based). This is a standard, benign notational shift and faithful.
- The code does not explicitly produce an element of `SpecialLinearGroup` but proves the defining property (determinant equals 1), which is mathematically equivalent to the requested membership. The included comment notes the implication to SL(n).

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no placeholders beyond the omitted proof (`sorry`).
- The matrix used is exactly the elementary matrix described.
- The target property (membership in SL(n)) is captured via determinant 1, which is definitionally equivalent in Mathlib.
- No change of ring: both use ℝ.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- Variables: n is a finite type with decidable equality; R is a commutative ring. This sets up the context of n×n matrices over R with finite index type n. This is a generalization of the usual SL(n) over a field like R or C, but acceptable as a standard mathlib generalization.
- def D1_set : Set (Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup n R) := { A | ∃ d : n → R, (A : Matrix n n R) = Matrix.diagonal d }.
  Natural language: D1_set is the subset of SL(n, R) consisting of those matrices that are diagonal (i.e., equal to Matrix.diagonal d for some diagonal entries d). Since A ranges over SL(n, R), this is indeed the set of diagonal matrices that lie in SL(n, R), i.e., diagonal matrices with determinant 1.
- noncomputable def D1_is_subgroup : Subgroup (Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup n R) := by sorry.
  Natural language: They intend to define a subgroup of SL(n, R) (i.e., a ""matrix group"") that should correspond to the set of diagonal matrices in SL(n, R). However, the definition is left as sorry, so no subgroup is actually constructed, and no link to D1_set is provided in the code.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
- The natural language statement is: Let D1(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n). Show D1(n) is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup of SL(n)).
- The Lean code introduces D1_set matching that set. However, the crucial part—showing it is a subgroup—is replaced by a sorry. Moreover, the declaration D1_is_subgroup does not even specify that its carrier is D1_set; it merely claims the existence of some Subgroup of SL(n, R) without tying it to D1_set. Thus, the formal statement that ""D1(n) is a matrix group"" is not actually stated/proved; instead, there is an unproven placeholder that could define any subgroup.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The natural statement asks to prove that the specific set D1(n) is a subgroup of SL(n). The code defines the set D1_set correctly but does not define or prove the subgroup structure for that set. The presence of sorry makes the definition vacuous, and the subgroup isn’t identified with D1_set in the code. Therefore, the translation fails.

Additional notes:
- The generalization to arbitrary commutative rings and index types is acceptable in principle.
- The critical failure is the vacuous use of sorry on the main result and the lack of explicit connection between the subgroup and D1_set.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: for each θ, the reflection across the line through the origin at angle θ is linear, and its matrix H_θ is an improper orthogonal matrix (H_θ ∈ O(2), det = −1).
- The Lean code defines a specific 2×2 matrix H(θ) with entries cos(2θ), sin(2θ), which is exactly the standard formula for reflection about the line with angle θ: 2uuᵀ − I with u = (cos θ, sin θ), yielding [[cos 2θ, sin 2θ], [sin 2θ, −cos 2θ]].
- The theorem’s statement (Hᵀ H = I and det = −1) captures “H_θ ∈ O(2) and det(H_θ) = −1”. The quantification over θ is present via the theorem’s argument (θ : ℝ).

3) Final check and differences:
- Faithful parts: The matrix H(θ) matches the reflection matrix across the specified line, and the theorem asserts precisely that it is orthogonal with determinant −1, i.e., an improper orthogonal matrix. This aligns with the core mathematical content.
- Minor omissions: The code does not explicitly state “the reflection is a linear operator,” nor does it explicitly identify H(θ) as the matrix of the reflection map (though the formula matches the reflection matrix). Also, it encodes membership in O(2) via the equation (Hᵀ)H = I rather than as an element of a specific O(2) structure. These are mild presentational differences and do not change the mathematical meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful to the statement about the matrix being improper orthogonal, with only minor omissions about explicitly mentioning linearity and the reflection map. Hence it nearly perfectly matches the intended statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The mathematical content matches the intended statement when interpreting C_k as the additive cyclic group ZMod k (standard in Mathlib) and interpreting “≅” as group isomorphism (here implemented as an AddEquiv).
- However, there are two issues:
  a) The use of `sorry` means the definition is a placeholder; it does not legitimately translate or define the isomorphism. Per the guidelines, introducing objects via `sorry` makes the translation fail.
  b) The code does not restrict m, n to be positive. While gcd(m, n) = 1 prevents most zero cases, it still allows (m, n) = (0, 1) or (1, 0). In those edge cases, ZMod 0 appears (which is infinite), whereas C_0 is not part of the usual statement. This is a slight generalization/mismatch relative to the finite cyclic groups C_n typically intended.

3) Final comparison:
- If we ignore `sorry`, the type signature states essentially the desired isomorphism between the additive cyclic group of order mn and the product of those of orders m and n under coprimeness, matching the original statement (up to the additive notation and slight generalization allowing zero).
- However, because the core content is provided via `sorry`, it fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions not be vacuous. Also, the lack of positivity assumptions introduces minor mismatch regarding C_n’s standard meaning.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to `sorry`; otherwise close in spirit. Grade reflects that with `sorry` removed and a positivity assumption added, it would be faithful.

No converse is stated; proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Given F a field and G = {E(t) : t ∈ F} with E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]], prove that G is a matrix group under multiplication. Typically this means G itself is a subgroup of GL(2, F) (or Units(Matrix 2×2 F)) under matrix multiplication; equivalently, the set of all E(t) is closed under multiplication and inversion and contains the identity.

The code defines E and G_set correctly. However, the theorem states only that there exists some subgroup H of units such that every element of H has underlying matrix of the form E(t). It does not assert that every matrix E(t) appears as an element of H (i.e., it lacks the converse direction). Therefore, the theorem as stated is too weak: the trivial subgroup {I} would satisfy the statement, since for any u in {I} there exists t (namely t = 0) with u = E(0). This does not show that G itself is a subgroup or that all E(t) are included as elements of H. Moreover, the theorem does not reference `G_set` nor assert equality between the set of underlying matrices of H and G_set.

Thus, the Lean theorem does not faithfully encode “G is a matrix group under multiplication”; it only encodes that there exists a subgroup consisting of matrices of the prescribed form, possibly a strict subset of G.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: G = {E(t)} is a matrix group (i.e., G itself is a subgroup of GL(2, F)).
- Lean: ∃ subgroup H ≤ Units(Matrix) such that every element’s underlying matrix is of the form E(t). Missing the reverse inclusion and the identification H’s underlying matrices = G. The statement allows H much smaller than G (even trivial), so it is not equivalent to the original claim.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions were used (E and G_set are properly defined). The mismatch is in the strength and direction of the main theorem.

The natural language statement is exactly: ""Assuming that A5 is a simple group, show that S5 is not a solvable group."" The Lean statement assumes `IsSimpleGroup (alternatingGroup (Fin 5))` and concludes `¬ IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm (Fin 5))`. This is a direct formalization.

- A5 is represented as `alternatingGroup (Fin 5)`, S5 as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)`: standard and faithful.

  Natural language translation:
  For a natural number n with n ≥ 2, consider the permutation group on Fin ((n − 1) + 1) (i.e., on n elements). For each i in Fin (n − 1) (i.e., i = 0, …, n − 2), define the adjacent transposition swap of the two adjacent elements Fin.castSucc i (which is i) and Fin.succ i (which is i + 1) in Fin n. Take the set consisting of these swaps as i ranges over Fin (n − 1). Then the subgroup generated by this set (i.e., the subgroup closure) is equal to the whole symmetric group on n elements (top subgroup ⊤ of Equiv.Perm (Fin n)).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: For n ≥ 2, S_n is generated by the adjacent transpositions {(1,2), (2,3), …, (n−1,n)}.
- Code: For n ≥ 2, the subgroup generated by the set {swap(i, i+1) | i ∈ {0, …, n−2}} equals the full permutation group on Fin n. This is the same assertion, with 0-based indexing instead of 1-based, and with Fin n as the underlying set. The top subgroup ⊤ corresponds to the whole S_n. Equiv.swap constructs transpositions; Fin.castSucc i and Fin.succ i are the adjacent elements i and i+1 in Fin n. Set.range over i : Fin (n − 1) gives exactly the adjacent transpositions.
- The minor type presentation Fin ((n − 1) + 1) instead of Fin n is a harmless definitional choice, mentioned in the comment. It does not change the mathematical meaning.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all objects are from Mathlib. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the task, as we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement precisely formalizes that S_n (permutations on n elements) is generated by adjacent transpositions. The only differences are indexing (0-based vs 1-based) and a definitional convenience in the type Fin ((n−1)+1) vs Fin n. Both are standard and faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's definitions and theorems.
- Comment block restates the informal theorem.
- `theorem monoid_hom.ker_eq_bot_iff_injective {G : Type*} [Group G] {H : Type*} [Group H] (f : G →* H) : f.ker = (⊥ : Subgroup G) ↔ Function.Injective (f : G → H) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For groups G and H, and a group homomorphism f: G → H (expressed as a MonoidHom in Mathlib), the kernel of f equals the bottom (trivial) subgroup of G if and only if f is injective.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original states: If f: G → H is a group homomorphism with kernel K then f is injective iff K is the trivial subgroup. In Lean, this is precisely the equivalence `f.ker = ⊥ ↔ Injective f`. The variable K is implicit as `f.ker`. The trivial subgroup is represented by `⊥ : Subgroup G`. The injectivity is `Function.Injective (f : G → H)`. All concepts align exactly.

3) Final check:
- The math problems are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of `[Group G] [Group H]` matches the group context required (as opposed to merely monoids where the statement could fail). The theorem name and statement are standard in Mathlib. Hence, the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Suppose we have n subgroups H 0, ..., H (n-1) of G (indexed by Fin n), and assume the ""uniqueness of expression"" property: for any choice f(k) ∈ H k, if the ordered product f(0) * f(1) * ... * f(n-1) equals 1, then each f(k) = 1. Under this assumption, for any distinct indices i ≠ j and any element x ∈ H i ∩ H j, we must have x = 1. In other words, distinct factors have trivial intersection.

There are no auxiliary placeholder definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib objects: Subgroup, Fin n, list product, etc. The proof is omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement: If G is the internal direct product G = H1 × H2 × ⋯ × Hn of normal subgroups H1, ..., Hn, then for any i ≠ j, H_i ∩ H_j = {1}.

The Lean theorem assumes a key property implied by being an internal direct product, namely the uniqueness of expression (at least at the identity): if a product of elements, one from each H_i, equals 1, then each of those elements is 1. From this, it concludes that pairwise intersections are trivial: for i ≠ j, H_i ∩ H_j = {1}. This matches the conclusion exactly.

Step 3: Are they the same math problem?
- Hypotheses: The original assumes full internal direct product of normal subgroups. The Lean code assumes only the uniqueness-of-expression property (no normality, no surjectivity to G). This is a slight generalization (weaker hypotheses). For the stated conclusion (pairwise trivial intersection), the uniqueness property suffices; normality and generation are not needed.
- Conclusion: Both assert that for i ≠ j, H_i ∩ H_j is trivial, i.e., any x lying in both H_i and H_j must be 1. The Lean statement formalizes this as: ∀ i j with i ≠ j, ∀ x ∈ H i ∩ H j, x = 1.

No vacuous placeholders or misleading auxiliary definitions are present. The generalization is acceptable per the guidelines, and the mathematical meaning aligns with the stated result.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib; open Polynomial: Sets up Mathlib and opens the Polynomial namespace.

- axiom Galois_group : Polynomial ℚ → Type*: Introduces an uninterpreted type intended to represent the Galois group associated to a polynomial. This is a placeholder; Mathlib has concrete notions of Galois groups for field extensions, not an axiom per polynomial.
- axiom Galois_group_group : ∀ p : Polynomial ℚ, Group (Galois_group p); attribute [instance] Galois_group_group: Asserts (axiomatically) that the above type is a group for each polynomial. Again a placeholder instance, not tied to Mathlib’s GaloisGroup.
- theorem solvable_by_radicals_iff_solvable (p : Polynomial ℚ) (hp : Irreducible p) : roots_expressible_by_radicals p ↔ IsSolvable (Galois_group p) := by sorry: States the main equivalence: for irreducible p ∈ ℚ[x], the predicate “roots expressible by radicals” is equivalent to the Galois group being solvable. The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Is the whole translation faithful?
- The high-level logical form matches the natural language statement: irreducible polynomial over ℚ; equivalence between solvability by radicals and solvable Galois group.
- However, the crucial notions are introduced as axioms/placeholders, not actual Mathlib definitions:
  - roots_expressible_by_radicals is an uninterpreted predicate with no connection to radicals or roots in ℂ.
  - Galois_group p is an uninterpreted type with a group structure asserted axiomatically, not connected to the splitting field or Mathlib’s Galois group constructions.
- This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and faithfully defined. The code does not use Mathlib’s existing notions (e.g., splitting fields, Galois groups of extensions, solvable by radicals where available) and instead replaces them by axioms. Thus, while the form of the theorem mirrors the statement, the translation is not faithful.

Step 3: Final comparison of math problems
- Same aspects:
  - Domain: polynomials over ℚ.
  - Hypothesis: irreducible p.
  - Claim: equivalence between roots expressible by radicals and solvability of the Galois group.
- Differences/problems:
  - The code does not define what “expressible by radicals” means; it is a bare axiom predicate.
  - The code does not define the specific Galois group attached to p (e.g., as Gal of the splitting field over ℚ); it postulates an arbitrary type with a group structure.
  - Because of these placeholders, the statement is not grounded in Mathlib’s actual concepts and could be satisfied by arbitrary interpretations, making it non-faithful according to the guidelines.

Conclusion: The translation fails due to vacuous placeholder axioms replacing the key mathematical concepts. If these placeholders were replaced by faithful Mathlib definitions, the final theorem statement would match the natural language statement, but as-is it is not faithful.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The module docstring explains the mathematical context: A5 simple, Galois group of general quintic is S5, hence not solvable by radicals because S5 is not solvable. It then explicitly states that the file only records a group-theoretic reduction: if a group is isomorphic to S5 and S5 is not solvable, then that group is not solvable, and that the polynomial/radical connection is not formalized here.
- `open Equiv`: Opens the namespace for equivalences.
- The theorem `general_quintic_not_solvable_by_radicals` is stated as: for any group `G`, given a group isomorphism `h : G ≃* Perm (Fin 5)` (i.e., an isomorphism to S5) and the assumption `hS5_not_solvable : ¬ IsSolvable (Perm (Fin 5))` (S5 is not solvable), conclude `¬ IsSolvable G` (G is not solvable). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Using the facts that A5 is simple and the Galois group of the general quintic is S5, prove that the roots of a general quintic cannot be expressed in terms of radicals. This requires:
  - Deduction that S5 is not solvable (using simplicity of A5 and knowledge about composition series and solvability).
  - Identifying the Galois group of the general quintic as S5.
  - Applying the Galois theory bridge: a polynomial is solvable by radicals iff its Galois group is solvable.
- The Lean theorem only proves (or rather states) a strictly group-theoretic lemma: if G ≅ S5 and S5 is not solvable, then G is not solvable. It does not:
  - Use or formalize the simplicity of A5.
  - Derive that S5 is not solvable from A5’s simplicity; it assumes it.
  - Mention Galois groups or polynomials, nor the equivalence between solvability by radicals and solvability of the Galois group.
  - Conclude anything about expressing roots by radicals.
- Hence, the code captures only a small intermediate lemma, not the full statement, and it deliberately stops short of the radicals conclusion as per the comment.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code proves (with a placeholder proof) a general group-theoretic fact: solvability is invariant under isomorphism; if S5 is not solvable then any group isomorphic to it is not solvable. The natural statement is about polynomials and radicals, relying on Galois theory and specific facts (A5 simple, Galois group of the general quintic is S5) to conclude non-solvability by radicals. The crucial bridges (A5 ⇒ S5 not solvable; Galois group solvable ⇔ solvable by radicals) and the polynomial context are absent. Thus the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes:
- No fake auxiliary definitions are introduced; the predicates and structures used (Group, IsSolvable, Equiv.Perm) are genuine Mathlib constructs.
- The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for statement auditing per the instructions, but it does not affect the main mismatch: the theorem is not the same as the original claim.

Conclusion: Not faithful. Grade reflects that it only captures a small, different intermediate lemma and omits the essential Galois-theoretic content and conclusion about radicals.

- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib, no mathematical content asserted.
- Comment block: Mentions the third isomorphism theorem informally, but comments do not affect the formal content.
- `theorem third_isomorphism_theorem : True := by sorry`: The formal statement is merely `True`. It introduces no groups, no normal subgroups, no inclusion hypothesis, no quotients, and no isomorphism. Moreover, it uses `sorry`, which is a placeholder and makes the declaration vacuous.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement asserts the third isomorphism theorem for groups: If H and K are normal in G and H ≤ K, then K/H is normal in G/H and (G/H)/(K/H) ≅ G/K. The Lean code does not formalize any of these notions; it does not even state a theorem about groups, normal subgroups, or quotients. It simply states `True`. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are entirely different. The natural language statement is a specific and substantive theorem about quotient groups and isomorphisms under normality and inclusion assumptions. The Lean code’s statement is the trivial proposition `True`, with no relation to the group-theoretic content. There are no auxiliary definitions; the only theorem is vacuous. Hence, the translation fails completely.

  This claims to define G as a subgroup of GL(4,F) represented as the group of units of 4×4 matrices, but provides no construction or proof (uses `sorry`). It also does not tie the subgroup to `G_set` at all; it could be any subgroup. This is a vacuous placeholder.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement: define G as those block upper triangular matrices with det(AC) ≠ 0 and verify G is a matrix group under multiplication (i.e., a subgroup of GL(4,F)). The code correctly defines the set `G_set`. However, the crucial verification that this set forms a subgroup (closure under multiplication, inverses, identity) is entirely missing and replaced by `sorry`. Moreover, `G_subgroup` does not even assert that its carrier equals the units coming from `G_set`. Thus the core claim is not formalized.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The code includes a correct definition of the set, but fails to verify group structure and does not connect the defined subgroup to the set. The presence of `sorry` makes the subgroup definition vacuous. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Other notes: Using Units(Matrix ...) as GL(4,F) is acceptable. The condition det(A*C) ≠ 0 is equivalent to A and C invertible over a field, so the set is accurately captured. The failure lies entirely in the omitted and unlinked subgroup construction.

- The natural statement: Let α = (1 2) and β = (1 2 3) in S_3, and let G = ⟨α, β⟩. Show G = S_3.
- The code uses α = (0 1) (the same transposition under 0-based indexing) and for β it uses (0 2 1) = β^{-1}. The subgroup generated by {α, β} equals the subgroup generated by {α, β^{-1}} in any group, so this is an equivalent formulation. The target equality “generated subgroup = S_3” is exactly expressed as Subgroup.closure {…} = ⊤.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences: 0-based vs 1-based indexing; β replaced by β^{-1} via the composition order. These do not change the mathematical content since ⟨α, β⟩ = ⟨α, β^{-1}⟩. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; everything relies on Mathlib primitives.

The theorem asserts that the subgroup generated by these two permutations is the top subgroup (the whole symmetric group). This matches the statement precisely, modulo the standard 0-based vs 1-based indexing convention.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses 0..n-1 whereas the statement uses 1..n. This is a harmless notational shift.
- The rotation is given functionally rather than by cycle notation, but it is the same permutation.
- The hypothesis hn : 2 ≤ n matches n ≥ 2.

- Normality is expressed elementwise rather than as `H.Normal`, but this is a standard equivalent formulation and thus faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code works over 2×2 real matrices with indices Fin 2.
- def H0 defines the matrix H0 by cases on the indices: it sets the (0,0) entry to 1, the (1,1) entry to -1, and all other entries to 0. This is exactly the diagonal matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]].
- def R (θ : ℝ) defines a matrix whose entries are:
  - (0,0) = cos(2θ), (0,1) = -sin(2θ), (1,0) = sin(2θ), (1,1) = cos(2θ), and 0 otherwise (the otherwise branch is redundant since i,j ∈ {0,1}). This is exactly the standard 2D rotation matrix at angle 2θ.
- theorem rotation_conjugation (θ : ℝ) : R θ * H0 * R θ = H0 states that for all real θ, the matrix equation R_{2θ} H0 R_{2θ} = H0 holds. The proof is omitted (sorry), but this does not affect the translation audit.

Faithfulness check against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines H0 as [[1,0],[0,-1]] and R_{2θ} as [[cos(2θ), −sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), cos(2θ)]], and asks to show R_{2θ} H0 R_{2θ} = H0 for all θ ∈ ℝ.
- The Lean code exactly defines these matrices and states the identical equation for all θ ∈ ℝ. The notation R θ in Lean corresponds to R_{2θ} in the text since the matrix entries use 2*θ.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; both matrices are concretely defined.
- The result is stated verbatim as in the natural language statement.

Final check: The two problems are the same. No discrepancies in dimensions, field, matrix entries, or quantification over θ. The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports Mathlib.
- States a theorem `permutation_representation_to_matrix_rep` with parameters: a type `G` with a group structure, a natural number `n`, and a field `F`. It also assumes `[DecidableEq (Fin n)]` and `[Fintype (Fin n)]` (both standard for `Fin n`).
- The statement: For every function `δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` (i.e., mapping each `g` to a permutation of `Fin n`), there exists a function `ρ : G → GL (Fin n) F` such that for all `g : G`, the underlying matrix of `ρ g` has entries `(i,j)` equal to `1` if `(δ g) j = i` and `0` otherwise. This exactly describes the permutation matrix for the permutation `δ g`.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry` (we only check the statement's faithfulness).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: Given a group `G`, integer `n`, and field `F`, any permutation representation `δ: G → S_n` gives rise to a matrix representation `ρ: G → GL_n(F)` by sending `g` to the permutation matrix `P_{δ(g)}`.
- Key points:
  - ""Permutation representation"" normally means a group homomorphism `δ : G → S_n`.
  - ""Matrix representation"" normally means a group homomorphism `ρ : G → GL_n(F)`.
  - The construction mapping `g` to the permutation matrix associated to `δ(g)` is described.
- The Lean statement:
  - Quantifies over any function `δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, not necessarily a group homomorphism.
  - Produces a function `ρ : G → GL (Fin n) F`, not asserted to be a group homomorphism.
  - It does correctly specify that `ρ g` is the permutation matrix corresponding to `δ g` (matrix entries 1/0 by the usual rule).

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- The crucial homomorphism/representation property is missing on both sides:
  - The code does not assume `δ` is a group homomorphism into `S_n`.
  - The code does not conclude `ρ` is a group homomorphism into `GL_n(F)`.
- Therefore, while the construction of the permutation matrix from `δ(g)` is correctly captured, the essence of ""representation"" (i.e., preserving the group operation) is not formalized. This is a significant mismatch.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the issue is the weakening of the hypotheses and conclusion regarding homomorphisms.

Conclusion: The code is close in describing the mapping to permutation matrices but is not faithful to the statement because it drops the representation (homomorphism) structure. Hence it does not pass as a faithful translation.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which provides definitions for real sine and cosine and standard theorems.
- `theorem cos_add_formula (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : Real.cos (θ1 + θ2) = Real.cos θ1 * Real.cos θ2 - Real.sin θ1 * Real.sin θ2 := by sorry`

- `theorem sin_add_formula (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : Real.sin (θ1 + θ2) = Real.sin θ1 * Real.cos θ2 + Real.cos θ1 * Real.sin θ2 := by sorry`
  Natural language: For all real numbers θ1 and θ2, sin(θ1 + θ2) equals sin θ1 times cos θ2 plus cos θ1 times sin θ2. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
The original statement asks for the addition formulas for sine and cosine for all real θ1, θ2. The Lean code states exactly these two identities as theorems over ℝ, using Mathlib’s Real.sin and Real.cos. While the natural language request mentions providing a conceptual derivation (a proof), our auditing instructions allow omitting proofs; the key is that the formal statements match. They do.

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
- Domain: Both specify all θ1, θ2 ∈ ℝ. Match.
- Content: The exact trigonometric addition formulas for sine and cosine. Match.
- No extraneous assumptions or weakened/strengthened claims. Match.
- The only difference is that the natural language asked for a conceptual derivation, whereas the Lean code leaves proofs as `sorry`. Under the given guidelines, this is acceptable and does not affect the faithfulness of the translation of the statements themselves.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the mathematical statements.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language and assess.
- import Mathlib / open Matrix: Brings in Mathlib and opens Matrix namespace; fine.
- def O (n : ℕ) : Type := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // Matrix.transpose A * A = 1}
  Natural language: Define O(n) as the subtype of real n×n matrices A satisfying Aᵀ A = I. This is the standard set of orthogonal matrices (over ℝ), modeled as a subtype, not yet a group structure. This matches the usual O(n) definition.
- def SO (n : ℕ) : Type := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // Matrix.transpose A * A = 1 ∧ Matrix.det A = 1}
  Natural language: Define SO(n) as the subtype of real n×n matrices that are orthogonal and have determinant 1. This is indeed the special orthogonal group as a set.
- theorem SO_normal_in_O {n : ℕ} : ∀ (g : O n) (h : SO n), transpose (g.1 * h.1 * transpose g.1) * (g.1 * h.1 * transpose g.1) = 1 ∧ det (g.1 * h.1 * transpose g.1) = 1 := by sorry
  Natural language: For every orthogonal matrix g and special orthogonal matrix h, the matrix g h gᵀ is orthogonal and has determinant 1. Equivalently, conjugation by any g ∈ O(n) sends SO(n) into itself. This is the core property used to show SO(n) is normal in O(n). While it doesn’t invoke the formal notion of a subgroup or normal subgroup, it captures the conjugation-invariance statement underpinning normality. Using gᵀ instead of g⁻¹ is appropriate for g orthogonal (since g⁻¹ = gᵀ).
- theorem det_of_orthogonal {n} (A) (h : Aᵀ A = 1) : det A = 1 ∨ det A = -1 := by sorry
  Natural language: Any real orthogonal matrix has determinant ±1. This is standard and relevant for the quotient description.
- theorem O_mod_SO_is_Z_units {n} : True := by sorry, with a comment explaining the intended result: O(n)/SO(n) ≃ Units ℤ.
  Natural language: This is not a formal statement of the intended isomorphism; it merely states True (a vacuous placeholder) with an explanatory comment. It does not formalize the determinant homomorphism, its kernel, or the quotient/group isomorphism.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- Original: Prove SO(n) ◁ O(n) and O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^×.
- Code for normality: The theorem SO_normal_in_O asserts that conjugation by any element of O(n) preserves SO(n) (as a set), which is the characteristic property for normality. While it doesn’t assert SO(n) is a subgroup or explicitly state normality within a group structure, it is an essentially faithful translation of the normality claim’s core content.
- Code for quotient isomorphism: The intended isomorphism to ℤ^× is not formalized. The final theorem is a placeholder returning True with a comment. This is a vacuous stand-in and does not state the desired fact.

Step 3: Final check: are they the same?
- The first part (normality) is reasonably faithful in spirit (conjugation invariance), though not packaged as a normal subgroup statement within group-theoretic structures. This is acceptable as a near-pass for that part.
- The second part (quotient isomorphism) is not stated at all; it is replaced by a trivial True. This is a serious mismatch and fails the translation for that part.

Auxiliary definitions:
- O and SO are legitimately defined (not vacuous). The two theorems SO_normal_in_O and det_of_orthogonal are meaningful statements (even though proofs are omitted, which is permissible here). However, the theorem O_mod_SO_is_Z_units is vacuous (True), which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Conclusion:
- Because the key quotient isomorphism is not actually stated, the translation is not faithful overall.
- If the final theorem were properly stated (e.g., existence of a group isomorphism O(n)/SO(n) ≃ Units ℤ via determinant with kernel SO(n)), the formalization approach would be appropriate. As it stands, it fails due to the vacuous final statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := fun p => (p.1 * Real.cos θ - p.2 * Real.sin θ, p.1 * Real.sin θ + p.2 * Real.cos θ)`
  This defines the map ρ_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 by the standard rotation-matrix formula: ρ_θ(x, y) = (x cos θ − y sin θ, x sin θ + y cos θ). This matches the given R_θX definition exactly.
- `theorem rho_is_rotation (θ : ℝ) (p : ℝ × ℝ) : ... := by sorry`
  The theorem states, for any angle θ and point p = (x, y), three properties:
  1) The first coordinate of ρ_θ(p) equals x cos θ − y sin θ.
  2) The second coordinate of ρ_θ(p) equals x sin θ + y cos θ.
  3) The squared Euclidean norm is preserved: (ρ_θ(p).1)^2 + (ρ_θ(p).2)^2 = x^2 + y^2.
  The first two conjuncts simply restate the definition (the “expected coordinate formula”). The third asserts norm preservation, a characteristic property of rotations (and reflections) but here it supports the intended geometric meaning.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines ρ_θ by the matrix R_θ and asks to show it is the rotation by θ about the origin. The code defines the same map via coordinates and asserts norm preservation. Since the map is explicitly given by the standard rotation matrix, this already captures “rotation by θ”. The additional norm-preservation property corroborates the geometric interpretation.
- The code does not explicitly state an angle-addition property (e.g., that the argument increases by θ) or orientation/determinant = 1, but given the explicit matrix entries with cos θ and sin θ, the map is indeed the standard rotation. Thus the translation is essentially faithful.

Final comparison:
- Same objects and map (R_θ acting on ℝ^2).
- Same intended meaning: ρ_θ is the rotation through θ about the origin.
- Minor omission: the code doesn’t explicitly claim the angle increases by θ, but uses the exact rotation matrix formula and norm preservation, which is sufficient to identify the map as the rotation by θ.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful, with a slight under-specification of the geometric angle property, but the explicit matrix formula makes it effectively equivalent.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_725 {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 < n) (a b c : Int) : ... := by sorry`
  This states: For any natural number n with 1 < n, and any integers a, b, c, the following holds in ZMod n: two equalities are true.
- `((a : ZMod n) * ((b : ZMod n) + (c : ZMod n)) = (a : ZMod n) * (b : ZMod n) + (a : ZMod n) * (c : ZMod n))`
  This is the left distributive law: the image of a in ZMod n multiplied by the sum of the images of b and c equals the sum of the products of the image of a with the images of b and c.
- `∧ (((b : ZMod n) + (c : ZMod n)) * (a : ZMod n) = (b : ZMod n) * (a : ZMod n) + (c : ZMod n) * (a : ZMod n))`
  This is the right distributive law: the sum of the images of b and c multiplied by the image of a equals the sum of the products of the images of b and c with the image of a.

The coercions `(x : ZMod n)` represent the congruence class [x] modulo n.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language fixes an integer n > 1 and quantifies over all integers a, b, c, asserting distributivity in Z/nZ. The Lean code fixes n as a natural number with 1 < n (equivalent to an integer n > 1 in this context) and a, b, c as integers, and asserts exactly the two distributive equalities in ZMod n using the standard coercions. This matches the intended meaning.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly formalizes the claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only minor difference is that Lean uses n : ℕ rather than n : ℤ with n > 1. Since “integer n > 1” implies n is a positive natural number and ZMod in Mathlib is defined for n : ℕ, this is a standard and faithful formalization choice.
- All components ([x] meaning the congruence class, distributive laws on both sides) are exactly represented.

  This states: Let A be an n×n real matrix. Assume h: Aᵀ A = I (the identity matrix). Then for all indices i, j (from Fin n), the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals `if i = j then 1 else 0`.

The RHS `if i = j then 1 else 0` is the Kronecker delta δ_ij (as entries of the identity matrix) in ℝ.

- Natural language: A ∈ O(n) (i.e., AᵀA = I) with columns A₁,...,A_n ∈ ℝⁿ; show A_i^T A_j = δ_{ij} for all i,j.
- Lean: Assumes AᵀA = 1 and concludes that for all column indices i,j, the dot product of columns i and j equals δ_{ij}.
These match exactly; the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language result.

3) Final check for differences:
- The hypothesis “A ∈ O(n)” is expressed as `A.transpose * A = 1`. This is the standard characterization.
- The conclusion “A_i^T A_j = δ_{ij}” is expressed as a sum over k of A k i * A k j equals if i=j then 1 else 0, i.e., the dot product of columns equals the Kronecker delta.

  Proof omitted (sorry).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The natural statement: Every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of: (1) cyclic of prime order, (2) alternating A_n (n ≥ 5), (3) simple groups of Lie type, including classical, exceptional and twisted (including Tits), (4) one of the 26 sporadic simple groups.

Issues:
- Vacuous placeholders: is_alternating, is_lie_type, is_classical_lie, is_exceptional_lie, is_sporadic are declared as constants with no definitions. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions and means the code does not actually formalize the mathematical concepts.
- Isomorphism vs property: The code uses “Fintype.card G = p” instead of “G ≃ cyclic group of order p.” While for finite groups |G| = p implies G is cyclic of order p, the theorem does not state isomorphism to C_p explicitly. This is a mild mismatch but could be acceptable if other parts were precise.
- Redundant/misaligned Lie-type disjuncts: The natural statement treats classical and exceptional/twisted as subclasses of Lie type, not additional separate categories. The code has disjunctions is_lie_type ∨ is_classical_lie ∨ is_exceptional_lie without any relationship between them (since they are placeholders). This is structurally different and potentially inconsistent unless defined appropriately.
- Sporadic groups: The code says ∃ i : ℕ, is_sporadic G i, with no constraint that there are exactly 26 such i. The natural statement explicitly says “one of the 26 sporadic simple groups.” While existence alone could be fine if is_sporadic is defined to pick exactly those 26, here it is an unconstrained placeholder, so the “26” content is not captured.
- No use of actual Mathlib structures for alternating groups or Lie-type classifications; these are not currently formalized in Mathlib, and the code does not attempt faithful representations.

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
- Different. The Lean code relies on undefined predicates (placeholders), does not encode isomorphisms to the listed groups, and does not faithfully capture the enumerative aspect (exactly 26 sporadics). Given the vacuous constants, the statement is not a legitimate translation per the guidelines.

Conclusion: Fails due to vacuous auxiliary definitions and multiple fidelity mismatches. If those constants were replaced by precise definitions capturing isomorphism to A_n, Lie-type subclasses, and the 26 sporadics, the high-level disjunctive structure could be made faithful, but as written it is not.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Bring in mathlib's matrix and real number infrastructure.
- noncomputable def rot (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...: Define the 2×2 rotation matrix by angle θ in the standard form [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]]. The pattern match over Fin 2 indices specifies these four entries correctly.
- def refl_x : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...: Define the reflection across the horizontal (x) axis as the diagonal matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]].
- theorem srdoty_alg_symmetry_743 (n : ℕ) (hn : 3 ≤ n) : rot (2 * Real.pi / n) * refl_x * rot (2 * Real.pi / n) = refl_x := by sorry: States the matrix identity R H R = H where R is the rotation by angle 2π/n and H is the reflection across the x-axis. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement/translation.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
Original statement: In the dihedral group D_n (n ≥ 3), with r the rotation by 2π/n and h the reflection across the horizontal axis, prove algebraically with matrices that r h r = h.
The Lean code sets up exactly these two matrices: r as the 2×2 rotation matrix of angle 2π/n and h as reflection across the x-axis, and states the equality rot(2π/n) * refl_x * rot(2π/n) = refl_x. This is precisely the matrix form of r h r = h. The use of matrices directly matches the requested algebraic argument with matrices.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- The code does not formalize D_n as an abstract group, but this is not required since the problem explicitly asks for an algebraic matrix argument; representing r and h as matrices is exactly what is requested.
- The angle used is 2π/n, consistent with the rotation generator of D_n.
- The reflection is across the horizontal axis, matching the description.
- The equality stated is r h r = h, exactly as in the problem.
- The hypothesis n ≥ 3 appears in the statement but is not necessary for the matrix identity; this is a harmless extra assumption and does not reduce fidelity.
- No vacuous placeholders are used for the key mathematical objects; rot and refl_x are concrete, standard definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement. Any slight generality or unused hypothesis (n ≥ 3) does not harm faithfulness.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For every θ ∈ ℝ, the rotation operator ρ_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2, defined by ρ_θ(X) = R_θ X, fixes the origin.
- The Lean code defines ρ_θ via the standard rotation matrix entries (cos θ, −sin θ; sin θ, cos θ) acting on coordinates, which is equivalent to R_θ X. The theorem precisely asserts that ρ_θ sends (0,0) to (0,0), i.e., fixes the origin, and universally quantifies over θ.

Final check:
- Domain/codomain: ℝ^2 is represented as ℝ × ℝ—standard in Lean.
- Definition of rotation: Explicit coordinate formula equals applying the rotation matrix R_θ.
- Claim: Fixes the origin is exactly `rho θ (0, 0) = (0, 0)` for all θ.
- No auxiliary vacuous placeholders; the only `sorry` is in the proof, which we do not assess for faithfulness of the statement.

  • This states: For an n×n real matrix A indexed by Fin n, assume Aᵀ A = I. Then for all indices i, j, the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals if i = j then 1 else 0.
  • The expression (∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j) is exactly the standard dot product of the i-th and j-th column vectors of A (since a column i is the function k ↦ A k i, and the dot product is sum over k of coordinate-wise products).
  • The right-hand side if i = j then 1 else 0 is the Kronecker delta δ_ij; Matrix.one_apply in mathlib gives exactly this form for the identity matrix entries.

  • No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; everything used is standard mathlib machinery. The theorem precisely isolates the desired statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let A ∈ O(n) with columns A_1, ..., A_n ∈ R^n. Show A_i · A_j = δ_{ij} for all i, j.
- Lean: Assumes Aᵀ A = I (i.e., A ∈ O(n)) and concludes ∑_k A_{k,i} A_{k,j} = δ_{ij}. This sum is exactly the standard dot product of columns i and j, and δ_{ij} is represented as if i = j then 1 else 0. Thus it is a faithful formalization of the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indices: Lean uses Fin n (0-based); natural language uses 1..n. This is a harmless indexing convention difference.
- Use of Aᵀ A = I rather than explicitly A ∈ O(n): equivalent in this context and standard in linear algebra.
- Dot product is written as an explicit sum rather than an inner product symbol; still exactly the same computation.

  Meaning: Fix any A ∈ O(2) not in SO(2) (i.e., an improper orthogonal matrix). Then every M ∈ O(2) is either in SO(2) or can be written as M = R A for some R ∈ SO(2). This asserts O(2) = SO(2) ∪ SO(2)A (a left coset decomposition).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let O(2) be the group of real 2×2 orthogonal matrices and SO(2) the subgroup of rotations. Prove that O(2) is generated by SO(2) ∪ {A} for any fixed improper orthogonal matrix A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2).
The Lean statement: Exactly assumes A ∈ O2 \ SO2 and concludes that any M ∈ O2 is either in SO2 or equals R*A with R ∈ SO2. This is stronger than just “generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}”: it shows a two-coset decomposition O(2) = SO(2) ⊔ SO(2)A. From this, it follows immediately that every M is a product of elements from SO(2) with a single A, hence M lies in the subgroup generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}. Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully captures and strengthens the original claim.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Definitions: is_orthogonal and is_special are legitimate, non-vacuous definitions matching standard math. O2 and SO2 sets match O(2) and SO(2).
- Assumptions: A ∈ O2 and A ∉ SO2 corresponds to A being an improper orthogonal matrix (det = −1), consistent with the statement.
- Conclusion: The Lean theorem states a coset decomposition (O2 = SO2 ∪ SO2·A), which implies the “generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}” claim. No extraneous or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary vacuous placeholders. Proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed per the auditing instructions since we check statement faithfulness only.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Scope: The code handles the general functional equation statement over ℂ, which matches the “In other words” part of the natural language. It does not explicitly mention the exponential function, but that was only the motivating example; the problem explicitly restates the general claim.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Minor technical note: The natural language mentions 1 ≠ 0, but in ℂ this is true and need not be assumed; the code appropriately assumes only f(0) = 1.

  [ [cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), −cos(2θ)] ], which is the standard matrix for reflection across the line through the origin that makes angle θ with the x-axis.
- `theorem O2_eq : {M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ | Mᵀ * M = 1} = Set.range R ∪ Set.range H := by sorry`
  states that the set of real 2×2 matrices M with Mᵀ M = I (i.e., the orthogonal group O(2)) equals the union of the ranges of the maps θ ↦ R(θ) and θ ↦ H(θ). Here `1` denotes the identity matrix.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement says O(2) equals the union of all rotations R_θ and all reflections H_θ across lines through the origin at angle θ. The code’s left-hand side `{M | Mᵀ * M = 1}` is precisely the usual definition of O(2). The right-hand side `Set.range R ∪ Set.range H` is the union of all rotation matrices and all reflection matrices as defined. The definitions of R_θ and H_θ in the code match the standard formulas given in the statement. Parameterization by θ ∈ ℝ is the same. Thus, the statement in Lean is a faithful formalization of the natural-language claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses matrices over ℝ indexed by `Fin 2`, exactly 2×2 real matrices.
- The identity `1` in Matrix is the identity matrix, so `Mᵀ * M = 1` is the orthogonality condition.
- The explicit formula for H(θ) matches the reflection across the line at angle θ with the x-axis.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated as an equality of sets, exactly as in the natural language statement.
Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Global setup: We work with matrices indexed by a finite type n (so this corresponds to n×n matrices where n = Fintype.card n). No issue; this is the standard mathlib way to talk about “size n”.

- det_conj: For any commutative ring R and g, h in GL n R, det(g h g⁻¹) = det h. This states the determinant is invariant under conjugation by an invertible matrix. This is correct and standard.

- SL_is_normal: For any commutative ring R and g, h in GL n R, if det h = 1, then det(g h g⁻¹) = 1. This shows the subset of GL n R consisting of determinant-1 elements is closed under conjugation. The comment says “equivalently, SL(n, R) is a normal subgroup of GL(n, R)”. The theorem itself only gives conjugation-invariance; it does not explicitly assert subgroup-ness or normality of SL(n, R). However, together with known facts (det multiplicative and det inverse property), this subset is indeed the kernel of det and hence a normal subgroup. So the content aligns with the normality claim, though not packaged as a formal “SL is normal” statement.

- GL_mod_SL_equiv_Real_units: There exists a group hom φ : GL n ℝ →* Units ℝ whose kernel is exactly {g | det g = 1}, and φ is surjective. This is the determinant map onto the multiplicative group of nonzero reals. The comment then says “Hence the quotient GL(n, R)/SL(n, R) is isomorphic to Rˣ”. The theorem does not explicitly construct the quotient isomorphism; it only provides the surjective hom with the described kernel. By the first isomorphism theorem, this implies GL n ℝ / ker φ ≃* Units ℝ. Note also that the theorem describes the kernel as a Set of GL, not explicitly as the SpecialLinearGroup subtype; still, it’s exactly the determinant-1 elements.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to show (i) SL(n) ◁ GL(n) and (ii) GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝ×. The code supplies (i) in essence via det-conjugation invariance implying the determinant-1 subset is normal; it does not explicitly refer to the SpecialLinearGroup type, but the subset {g | det g = 1} is exactly what SL(n) is meant to be. This is a standard, faithful formalization step.
- For (ii), the code provides the determinant homomorphism with kernel the determinant-1 subset and surjectivity onto Units ℝ, from which the quotient isomorphism follows by a standard theorem. However, the code does not explicitly state or construct the group isomorphism between the quotient GL(n)/SL(n) and ℝ×; it only gives the data (surjective hom with kernel) that implies it.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Differences:
  - The normality result is not stated in terms of the subgroup object SpecialLinearGroup n R being normal in GL n R; instead, it is stated as conjugation preserving the condition det = 1 for elements of GL. This is mathematically equivalent content but not packaged as a normal-subgroup statement.
  - The quotient isomorphism GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝ× is not explicitly formalized; instead, a surjective hom with kernel determinant-1 is provided, with the isomorphism only mentioned in a comment. One would need to invoke the first isomorphism theorem to obtain the actual quotient isomorphism.
- These are presentation/packaging differences, not substantive mathematical discrepancies. There are no vacuous placeholders; all objects are standard mathlib ones.

Conclusion: The code captures the mathematical essence of the statement, but it stops short of stating the quotient isomorphism explicitly and doesn’t identify SL as a subgroup in Lean’s SpecialLinearGroup API. Hence it’s almost faithful, but not verbatim the same statement in Lean.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable (n : Int)`: Fix an integer n as the modulus.
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_824_refl (a : Int) : a ≡ a [ZMOD n]`: For any integer a, a is congruent to itself modulo n (reflexivity of congruence).
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_824_symm {a b : Int} (h : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) : b ≡ a [ZMOD n]`: If a is congruent to b modulo n, then b is congruent to a modulo n (symmetry of congruence).
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_824_trans {a b c : Int} (hab : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) (hbc : b ≡ c [ZMOD n]) : a ≡ c [ZMOD n]`: If a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n) (transitivity of congruence).

All use Int.ModEq with notation `a ≡ b [ZMOD n]`, i.e., n ∣ (a - b), which is the standard congruence modulo n on integers.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks to prove the three equivalence relation properties of congruence modulo a fixed positive integer n for integers a, b, c. The Lean statements exactly mirror these three properties for Int.ModEq.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Scope: The Lean code does not impose the positivity constraint on n; it allows any integer n. This is a slight generalization, but the properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) are valid for all n in Mathlib's definition (even n = 0, where congruence reduces to equality). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions.
- Conclusion: The translation is faithful (indeed slightly more general) and matches the intended mathematical content.

- `noncomputable def H0 ...`: Defines the 2×2 real matrix H0 with entries: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=-1. This is exactly H_0 = [[1,0],[0,-1]].
- `noncomputable def R (φ : ℝ) ...`: Defines the rotation matrix R_φ with entries: (0,0)=cos φ, (0,1)=-sin φ, (1,0)=sin φ, (1,1)=cos φ. This matches R_φ = [[cos φ, -sin φ],[sin φ, cos φ]].

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For each θ ∈ ℝ, H_θ = H_0 R_{-2θ}, with explicit definitions of H_0 and R_φ. The Lean code defines H_0 and R_φ exactly as in the statement and asserts the same equality. The definition of H_θ in the code matches the product H_0 R_{-2θ} via standard trig identities (cos(-2θ)=cos 2θ, sin(-2θ)=-sin 2θ), yielding exactly the given entries for H_θ. No placeholders or vacuous definitions are used; all matrices are concretely defined.

3) Final check for differences:
- Matrix multiplication order (H0 * R(-2θ)) matches H_0 R_{-2θ} in the statement.
- The rotation matrix sign conventions match the given R_φ.
- The indexing via Fin 2 correctly enumerates the four entries with the final else covering (1,1).
- No extraneous assumptions or generalizations. The theorem states exactly the natural language claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `noncomputable def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix whose entries are R(0,0)=cos θ, R(0,1)=−sin θ, R(1,0)=sin θ, R(1,1)=cos θ. This is exactly the standard rotation matrix in 2D.
- `theorem R_mem_SO2 (θ : ℝ) : (Matrix.transpose (R θ)) * (R θ) = 1 ∧ Matrix.det (R θ) = 1 := ...` states that for any real θ, the transpose of R θ multiplied by R θ equals the identity matrix, and the determinant of R θ is 1. These are precisely the defining conditions for membership in the special orthogonal group SO(2): orthogonality (QᵀQ = I) and determinant 1.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks to show that the given 2×2 rotation matrix belongs to SO(2) for every θ ∈ ℝ. The Lean statement asserts both orthogonality and determinant 1 for R θ, which is exactly the condition “R θ ∈ SO(2)”. Although it does not use the `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` type, expressing the defining properties directly is a faithful translation.

3) Final check and differences:
- Scope: Both are for every θ ∈ ℝ.
- Object: The same 2×2 rotation matrix is defined.
- Claim: Membership in SO(2) is encoded as (transpose R) * R = I and det R = 1. This is equivalent to the informal statement. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used. The formulation as a conjunction instead of an explicit membership predicate is an equivalent and standard way to express SO(2) membership.

- structure Mat2 ...: Define a 2×2 real matrix as a structure with entries a, b, c, d.

- instance : HMul Mat2 Mat2 Mat2 := ⟨mul⟩: Use this multiplication as the * operation on Mat2.
- def zeroM ...: Define the zero matrix [[0,0],[0,0]].
- def oneM ...: Define the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]].
- def G_set : Set Mat2 := { M | M.a = M.d ∧ M.b = - M.c }: Define G as the set of matrices with a = d and b = −c, i.e., exactly matrices of the form [[x, −y],[y, x]]. This matches the given G = {[[a, −b],[b, a]]} by taking x = a and y = b.
- def G'_set : Set Mat2 := G_set \ { zeroM }: Define G' as G with the zero matrix removed, i.e., G \ {0}.
- The theorem srdoty_alg_abstract_gps_619 states four properties:
  1) Closure: For all A,B ∈ G', A * B ∈ G'.
  2) Associativity: For all A,B,C ∈ G', (A*B)*C = A*(B*C).
  3) Identity membership: oneM ∈ G'.
  4) Inverses: For each A ∈ G', there exists B ∈ G' such that A*B = oneM and B*A = oneM.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement asks to prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication, where G' is the set of matrices [[a, −b],[b, a]] with the zero matrix removed.
- The code defines exactly that set G and its subset G' by removing 0, using a faithful characterization (a = d and b = −c).
- The theorem then asserts the group axioms for G' with respect to matrix multiplication: closure, associativity, identity in the set, and existence of inverses within the set.
- While the theorem does not explicitly state the identity laws (oneM * A = A and A * oneM = A), it specifies that for each A there is B with A*B = oneM and B*A = oneM. Together with associativity, this implies oneM acts as a two-sided identity for all A in G' (e.g., from A*B = 1, associativity gives 1*A = (A*B)*A = A*(B*A) = A*1, and also 1*A = A by multiplying the first equality by A on the left, and similarly A*1 = A by multiplying B*A = 1 on the right by A). Thus the provided conditions suffice for G' to be a group under * with identity oneM.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The set G_set matches the intended matrices [[a, −b],[b, a]].
- G'_set correctly removes only the zero matrix.
- The operation is standard matrix multiplication.
- The theorem asserts all necessary group properties (closure, associativity, identity element in the set, and inverses within the set). The slightly nonstandard way of stating the identity property is nevertheless sufficient and faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all auxiliary definitions are legitimate. The use of a custom Mat2 instead of Mathlib's Matrix is acceptable and faithful to the mathematics.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully formalizes the natural language statement that G' is a group under matrix multiplication.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient group is ((Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)ˣ), i.e., the group of invertible 2×2 real matrices (GL(2, ℝ)). Coercions (M : Matrix ...) turn a unit into its underlying matrix.

1) Theorem G_is_subgroup:
  Statement: There exists a Subgroup H of GL(2, ℝ) such that for all invertible matrices M, M ∈ H if and only if the (1,0)-entry of M is 0; i.e., the lower-left entry is zero. In 2×2 this means exactly the invertible upper-triangular matrices. Since we are in the units type, invertibility (and hence nonzero diagonal product) is automatic. This matches the intended G = { [a b; 0 c] with a,c ≠ 0 } viewed as a subgroup of GL(2, ℝ).

2) Theorem N_is_normal:
  Statement: There exists a Subgroup N of GL(2, ℝ) such that for all invertible matrices M, M ∈ N iff the (0,0)-entry and (1,1)-entry are 1 and the (1,0)-entry is 0; i.e., matrices of the form [1 b; 0 1]. Moreover, for every g in GL(2, ℝ), the conjugation image (fun n => g * n * g⁻¹) '' (N : Set _) equals N. This is precisely the statement that N is normal in GL(2, ℝ).

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: (i) Show G = { [a b; 0 c] } is a subgroup of GL(2). (ii) Let N = { [1 b; 0 1] }. Prove N ◁ G (i.e., N is a normal subgroup of G). One must show both that N is a subgroup and that it is normal in G.
- For (i): The Lean theorem G_is_subgroup matches the content: it constructs a subgroup H of GL(2) consisting of exactly the invertible upper triangular matrices (characterized by lower-left entry = 0 in the units type). This is faithful.
- For (ii): The Lean theorem N_is_normal defines N as the subgroup of GL(2) with the right membership property (top-left = 1, bottom-left = 0, bottom-right = 1), i.e., precisely the set N in the problem. It also proves a normality statement, but it states N is normal in the whole GL(2, ℝ), i.e., for all g ∈ GL(2). The problem only asks normality in G (upper triangular invertible matrices). Being normal in GL(2) would imply normal in G, so this is a strengthening; however, the code does not relate N to G at all.

Key discrepancies:
- The second theorem asserts normality in GL(2) rather than in G. This is a stronger statement than requested and, importantly, it is independent of any previously defined subgroup G. The code does not assert that N is a subgroup of G nor that the conjugation invariance holds for all g ∈ G; it asserts it for all g ∈ GL(2). This breaks the direct correspondence to “N ◁ G.” Because the two theorems are existential and independent, there is no linkage between the H in the first and the N in the second theorem.
- Minor technicality: The natural language did not explicitly restrict a, c ≠ 0 when describing G, but since G is a subgroup of GL(2), this is implicit; the Lean formulation correctly handles this by working inside the units type.

Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? Not exactly. The first part (G is a subgroup of GL(2)) matches well. The second part in Lean states N is normal in GL(2), not specifically normal in G, and it does not tie N to G. This is a significant mismatch from the requested “N ◁ G,” though it is a strengthening if true. Because the code uses separate existentials with no connection, it does not faithfully formalize “N is normal in G.”

Conclusion: Not fully faithful; close on the first part, but the second part is a different (stronger and unrelated) statement in the code.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the Mathlib library.
- Comment block describes the polarization identity.
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) : ... := by sorry` states: For all complex numbers z and w, the following equality holds. The left-hand side is `4 * z * star w`, i.e., 4 times z times the complex conjugate of w (since `star` on ℂ is complex conjugation). The right-hand side is the sum of two complex terms:
  - `Complex.ofReal (Complex.normSq (z + w) - Complex.normSq (z - w))` is the real number |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 coerced into ℂ (since `Complex.normSq` returns an ℝ, namely |·|^2, and `Complex.ofReal` embeds ℝ into ℂ).
  - `Complex.I * Complex.ofReal (Complex.normSq (z + Complex.I * w) - Complex.normSq (z - Complex.I * w))` is i times the real number |z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2, again coerced to ℂ. Here `Complex.I` is the imaginary unit i.
There are no auxiliary definitions; the `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for auditing faithfulness of the statement.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
The natural-language statement is: Prove the polarization identity 4 z \bar{w} = |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i ( |z+iw|^2 - |z - iw|^2 ). The Lean theorem asserts exactly this identity for all z, w : ℂ, using `star w` for \bar{w}, `Complex.normSq` for |·|^2, and `Complex.ofReal` to view the real-valued differences as complex numbers. The multiplication by i is represented by `Complex.I * ...`. This matches the original statement precisely.

3) Final check for differences:
- Type coercions with `Complex.ofReal` are explicit in Lean but implicit in the natural statement; this is a standard and faithful formalization detail.
- `star w` is indeed the complex conjugate \bar{w} in ℂ.
- `Complex.normSq` equals |·|^2. 
No substantive differences; no vacuous placeholders; no extraneous generalization/specialization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: bring in Mathlib and open the complex namespace.
- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) (v : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := ...`: Defines ρ_θ on R^2 by identifying v = (v.1, v.2) with the complex number z = v.1 + v.2 i, then mapping z ↦ exp(i θ) z, and finally returning its real and imaginary parts as a pair in R^2. This is the standard rotation by angle θ via complex multiplication.
- The theorem `angle_between_rho_eq_theta (θ : ℝ) {v : ℝ × ℝ} (hv : v ≠ (0,0)) : ∃ k : Int, (arg(exp(i θ) * z) - arg(z) - θ) = 2π k` (with z = v.1 + v.2 i) states: for any real θ and any nonzero vector v, the difference of arguments arg(exp(iθ) z) − arg(z) differs from θ by an integer multiple of 2π. This captures that the oriented angle from v to ρ_θ(v) equals θ modulo 2π. The nonzero hypothesis avoids degenerate issues with argument at 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “for any θ ∈ R and any nonzero X ∈ R^2, the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ (hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ).”
- The code defines ρ_θ exactly as complex multiplication by exp(iθ), i.e., a rotation by θ.
- The theorem formalizes the angle claim using Complex.arg (principal argument) and asserts equality up to an integer multiple of 2π, which is the standard precise formulation when using a single-valued branch of arg. This is the customary way to formalize “angle equals θ” without committing to a particular branch for the angle difference.

3) Final comparison:
- Small nuance: the Lean theorem states the equality modulo 2π (via an integer k), whereas the natural language states “equals θ” without explicitly mentioning modulo 2π or branch issues. In rigorous formalization, this modulo 2π qualification is expected. The statement remains essentially the same mathematically: it conveys that ρ_θ is a rotation by θ.
- Another minor point: the theorem uses Complex.arg explicitly rather than defining an abstract “angle between vectors,” but it is a faithful representation of the oriented angle between v and ρ_θ(v).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; ρ is correctly defined, and the theorem statement is substantive (the proof is omitted, but that is acceptable per the task).

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization, with the standard modulo 2π technicality. Hence it passes, with only a slight formal nuance compared to the natural language wording.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The theorem `schwarz_lemma_disk` is about a complex function `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
- `hhol : DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1)` means f is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on the open unit disk {z : ‖z‖ < 1}.
- `hmap : ∀ z, ‖z‖ < 1 → ‖f z‖ < 1` means f maps the open unit disk into itself (for any z in the disk, the image lies in the disk).
- `h0 : f 0 = 0` is the condition f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion: `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1` states |f'(0)| ≤ 1, where `deriv` is the complex derivative. Since the disk is open and `hhol` holds on it, `deriv f 0` is the usual derivative at 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: If f: 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1. The Lean statement exactly matches this: holomorphic on the open unit disk, maps the disk into itself, vanishes at 0, conclude the bound on the derivative at 0.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean function is defined on all of ℂ, but only assumed holomorphic on and mapping the unit disk into itself. This is a standard and harmless generalization of having domain 𝔻 only.
- The mapping condition uses strict inequality ‖f z‖ < 1, consistent with 𝔻 being the open unit disk.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the statement is precise and standard in Mathlib terminology.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `inductive gens : Type | a | b` introduces two formal generators a and b for a free group.
- The theorem `srdoty_alg_present_327` states there exists a group homomorphism `f : FreeGroup gens →* QuaternionGroup 2` such that:
  - `f (FreeGroup.of a ^ 2) = 1` (the image of a^2 is the identity in QuaternionGroup 2),
  - `f (FreeGroup.of b ^ 2) = 1` (the image of b^2 is the identity),
  - `f (FreeGroup.of a * FreeGroup.of b) ^ 2 = 1` (equivalently, `f ((ab)^2) = 1`),
  - and the kernel of `f` is the normal closure of the set `{a^2, b^2, (ab)^2}` in the free group.

Thus, the statement encoded by the theorem is that QuaternionGroup 2 is a quotient of the free group on two generators by the normal closure of the relators a^2, b^2, and (ab)^2, i.e., by the relations a^2 = 1, b^2 = 1, and (ab)^2 = 1.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
The original statement says that the quaternion group Q8 is presented by ⟨a, b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2⟩, i.e., the relations assert that a^2, b^2, and (ab)^2 are equal to each other (not necessarily equal to 1). In particular, in Q8 they are all equal to −1, an element of order 2. The correct way to encode this as relators in a free group is to impose a^2 = b^2 and a^2 = (ab)^2, i.e., the kernel should be the normal closure of {a^2 b^{-2}, (ab)^2 a^{-2}} (or an equivalent generating set that forces these equalities). One can also derive from these that this common element has order 2, recovering Q8.

However, the Lean code instead imposes a^2 = 1, b^2 = 1, and (ab)^2 = 1, which is a different presentation (in fact, it presents a group where a and b are involutions and (ab) is an involution, leading to a very different group, typically the Klein four group). This is not the same as requiring a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2.

Additionally, the code does not assert that the induced map is surjective or that the quotient by the stated relations is isomorphic to QuaternionGroup 2. For a faithful formalization of “is presented by,” one should either give an isomorphism between the quotient by the intended relators and QuaternionGroup 2, or state that there exists a surjective homomorphism from the free group whose kernel is the normal closure of the intended relators.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code enforces the relations a^2 = 1, b^2 = 1, and (ab)^2 = 1, which is not the same as a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2. The correct relators should encode equalities among these squares, not that each is the identity. Moreover, the code omits surjectivity or an explicit isomorphism statement needed to match the notion of a presentation. Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Key differences:
- Wrong relators: code uses a^2 = 1, b^2 = 1, (ab)^2 = 1 instead of a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2.
- Missing surjectivity/isomorphism clause for the presentation.
- Minor: the third displayed relation uses f((ab))^2 = 1 instead of f((ab)^2) = 1; this is equivalent for a homomorphism but does not fix the core mismatch.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Metric` just bring in necessary libraries and notations (sets, metric balls).
- The theorem `maximum_modulus_principle_local` concerns: an open set `U : Set ℂ`, a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, and a point `z0 : ℂ`.
- Hypotheses:
  - `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open in ℂ.
  - `hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U`: f is analytic (holomorphic) on U.
  - `hmax : ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ ball z0 r ⊆ U ∧ ∀ z ∈ ball z0 r, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖f z0‖`: there exists r > 0 such that the open ball centered at z0 with radius r lies in U, and for all z in that ball, |f(z)| ≤ |f(z0)|. This encodes that |f| attains a local maximum at z0 relative to U; moreover it implies z0 ∈ U since z0 ∈ ball z0 r.
- Conclusion:
  - `∃ r' : ℝ, 0 < r' ∧ ball z0 r' ⊆ U ∧ ∀ z ∈ ball z0 r', f z = f z0`: there exists r' > 0 such that the open ball centered at z0 of radius r' is contained in U and f is constant on that ball with value f z0. This is exactly “f is constant in a neighborhood of z0 (within U)”.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U ⇒ f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
- Lean: Uses f : ℂ → ℂ together with `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` instead of f : U → ℂ; this is a standard and equivalent formalization (behavior outside U is irrelevant). The local maximum condition is expressed via an open ball contained in U where |f| ≤ |f(z0)|, which is equivalent to the usual definition and implies z0 ∈ U. The conclusion gives a smaller ball where f is constant equal to f z0, i.e., constant in a neighborhood.
- Terminology: “analytic on U” in Mathlib matches “holomorphic on U” for complex-valued functions; the norm `‖f z‖` is the complex modulus.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the statement matches the original in meaning.

Final check: The mathematical content is the same. Minor formalization differences (domain of f, explicit ball subset conditions) are faithful and standard. Therefore the translation passes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem integral_parametric_holomorphic (U : Set ℂ) (ψ : ℂ × ℝ → ℂ)` introduces an open set U in the complex plane and a function ψ from ℂ × ℝ to ℂ.
- `(hU : IsOpen U)` assumes U is open.
- `(hψ : ContinuousOn ψ (U ×ˢ (Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)))` assumes ψ is continuous on the subset U × [0,1] (Icc is the closed interval). This matches the requirement that ψ is continuous on U × [0,1].
- `(hhol : ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ψ (z, t)) U)` assumes that for each fixed t ∈ [0,1], the map z ↦ ψ(z,t) is holomorphic on U (DifferentiableOn over ℂ).
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => MeasureTheory.integral (MeasureTheory.volume.restrict (Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)) fun t => ψ (z, t)) U` says that the function h(z) = ∫_{[0,1]} ψ(z,t) dμ (μ is Lebesgue measure on ℝ, here written as volume.restrict to [0,1]) is holomorphic on U. This corresponds to the claimed holomorphicity of z ↦ ∫_0^1 ψ(z,t) dt.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: U ⊂ ℂ is open; ψ: U × [0,1] → ℂ is continuous; for each t ∈ [0,1], z ↦ ψ(z,t) is holomorphic; then h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z,t) dt is holomorphic on U.
- The Lean statement requires exactly these hypotheses: continuity of ψ on U × [0,1] and holomorphicity in z for each fixed t, and concludes that the integral over t from 0 to 1 yields a holomorphic function on U. The use of the Lebesgue integral over Icc(0,1) matches the usual integral dt on [0,1] for continuous functions.
- ψ is defined on all ℂ × ℝ in Lean, but the conditions are only imposed on U × [0,1]; this is a harmless generalization that still captures the intended statement.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- Domains: Natural language defines ψ only on U × [0,1]; Lean defines ψ globally but restricts continuity to U × [0,1]. No substantive difference for the theorem.
- Interval: Both use [0,1] (Icc in Lean). Matches.
- Type of integral: Natural language implicitly Riemann; Lean uses Lebesgue over a compact interval, which coincides for continuous functions. Matches.
- Conclusion: Both assert holomorphicity on U (DifferentiableOn ℂ on U). Matches.

In words: assuming f is complex-differentiable at z0 with derivative f', f is conformal at z0 if and only if that derivative is nonzero.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Suppose f is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.
- Being holomorphic implies the existence of a complex derivative at every point, in particular at z0. Thus, the Lean hypothesis HasDerivAt f f' z0 is exactly the local condition needed to talk about f'(z0). The theorem states the equivalence between conformality at z0 and nonvanishing of the derivative at z0, which matches the target statement.
- The code presents a slightly more general/local version: it assumes only local differentiability at z0 rather than global holomorphicity. This is a standard and acceptable strengthening; it still faithfully captures the intended statement at the point z0.

3) Final check for differences:
- Difference: The code does not assume global holomorphicity, only HasDerivAt at z0. This is a benign generalization, not a mismatch. The equivalence itself (ConformalAt f z0 ↔ f' ≠ 0 under HasDerivAt) is precisely the intended content.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions (HasDerivAt, ConformalAt) appropriately. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed per the instructions.

- open Complex: Open the Complex namespace so names like sin, cos, abs can be referenced more easily (though here they are still used with explicit qualification).
- theorem sin_abs_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 : ℝ) / 2 * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus of sin z is at most (1/2) times e to the power |z|. That is, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- theorem cos_abs_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 : ℝ) / 2 * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus of cos z is at most (1/2) times e to the power |z|. That is, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement requests proving, for all z ∈ ℂ, the two inequalities |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems exactly state these inequalities using Complex.abs for modulus and Real.exp for the exponential, with the coefficient (1 : ℝ) / 2 matching 1/2. The quantification over all z : ℂ is explicit. There are no extra hypotheses or changes in the constants. Thus, the statements are faithful translations of the given natural language statements.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there are merely theorem statements with placeholder proofs (sorry), which is acceptable for a translation check. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Complex.sin, Complex.cos, Complex.abs, Real.exp). No discrepancies in domain, constants, or inequality direction.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Set up by importing mathlib and opening the Complex namespace; no mathematical content change.
- Docstring states the intended theorem in words; no effect on the formal content.
- `theorem abs_tanh_le_tanh_abs_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.tanh z) ≤ Real.tanh (abs z.re) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the complex modulus of tanh z is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic tangent of the absolute value of the real part of z. Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus |·| on ℂ, `Complex.tanh` is the complex hyperbolic tangent, `z.re : ℝ` is the real part, `abs z.re` is |Re z| (Real.abs), and `Real.tanh` is the real tanh function.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement
Original: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |tanh z| ≤ tanh |Re z|.”
Lean: Exactly the same mathematical content: ∀ z ∈ ℂ, |tanh z| ≤ tanh(|Re z|), with the correct interpretations of norms/absolute values and tanh in the complex vs real settings.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- LHS: |tanh z| interpreted as complex modulus of Complex.tanh z — matches.
- RHS: tanh |Re z| interpreted as Real.tanh (|Re z|) — matches.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable per instructions.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement matches the natural language precisely: domain is ℂ, the hypothesis is |z| < 1, and the claimed inequality is exactly the same. The use of Complex.log denotes the principal complex logarithm, which is appropriate here; with |z| < 1, 1 − z ≠ 0 and lies away from the branch cut, so the expression is well-defined. The denominator is positive under the hypothesis, consistent with the stated inequality.

They are the same. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced, and no generalization or restriction beyond the original statement is present.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The statement is a theorem named `complex_differentiable_on_implies_analytic_on`.
- Parameters: `U : Set ℂ` with hypothesis `hU : IsOpen U`; a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`; and hypothesis `hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`.
- Conclusion: `AnalyticOn ℂ f U`.
- In words: If U is an open subset of ℂ and f is complex differentiable on U, then f is analytic on U. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The first sentence of the natural language statement says: “If f: U → ℂ is holomorphic on a domain U ⊂ ℂ, then f is analytic.” The Lean theorem directly captures this implication (with U assumed open; it does not require connectedness). Using `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` as “holomorphic on U” and `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` as “analytic on U” is standard in Mathlib.
- The natural language goes on to explicate what “analytic” means: for any z₀ ∈ U, f has a Taylor series that converges in the disk {z : |z − z₀| < R}, where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the series sums to f. The conclusion `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` does encode that around each point in U there exists a convergent power series representing f on some disk (and hence the sum equals f locally). However, the Lean statement does not mention anything about the radius being equal to the distance to the nearest singularity; it merely asserts analyticity, which guarantees the existence of some positive radius but not the maximal radius nor its identification with the distance to the nearest singularity.
- Additional minor differences: the natural language uses “domain” (open and connected), whereas the Lean statement assumes only “IsOpen U” (dropping connectedness). This is a harmless generalization for the implication holomorphic ⇒ analytic.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- The Lean code faithfully captures the core implication “holomorphic on an open set implies analytic on that set.”
- It does not capture the stronger, more specific claim about the radius of convergence being exactly the distance to the nearest singularity. That part is missing entirely from the Lean statement.
- Therefore, while the main implication is present, the Lean code does not fully translate the full natural language statement as given.

Given these points, the translation is not fully faithful due to the omission of the radius/nearest singularity characterization, though it correctly formalizes the primary implication.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For a field F, the symmetric group S_n is isomorphic to the subgroup of GL_n(F) consisting of permutation matrices, via the map α ↦ P_α where P_α is obtained by permuting the columns of the identity by α.
- The Lean code captures the key mathematical content: it specifies the subgroup as exactly those invertible matrices with 0/1 entries and exactly one 1 in each row and column, and asserts the existence of an injective homomorphism whose image is precisely this set—hence an isomorphism between S_n and that subgroup.
- The definition `perm_matrix` matches the intended matrix P_α (it permutes columns by σ: column j has its 1 in row σ j, and Pσ e_j = e_{σ j}).

3) Differences and potential issues:
- The theorem asserts the existence of some injective homomorphism f with the correct image, but it does not explicitly state f(σ) = the unit corresponding to `perm_matrix σ`. The natural language statement says “via the map α ↦ P_α,” i.e., it specifies the particular map. While the code defines `perm_matrix`, it does not tie the existentially quantified f to this definition in the theorem statement. Mathematically, the existence of an injective hom with precisely that image still yields the isomorphism to the subgroup of permutation matrices, so the main content is preserved, but the explicit identification of f as α ↦ P_α is not enforced in the statement.
- The use of units `(Matrix ...)ˣ` instead of an explicit `GL(n, F)` structure is a standard and faithful formalization in Mathlib.
- The predicate `is_perm_unit` is a legitimate, non-vacuous definition matching the usual definition of permutation matrices, and no vacuous placeholders are used.

Conclusion: The code is essentially faithful to the statement (S_n is isomorphic to the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL_n(F)), but it does not explicitly name the isomorphism as α ↦ P_α in the theorem (despite defining `perm_matrix`). This is a slight mismatch, but the mathematical content—existence of the isomorphism onto the correct subgroup—is captured.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language
- Context: U ⊆ ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, z0, c ∈ ℂ.
- Assumptions:
  - hU_open: U is open.
  - hU_conn: U is connected.
  - hf: f is analytic on U (holomorphic on U).
  - h_nonconst: ¬(∀ z, f z = c), i.e., f is not identically equal to the constant c on all of ℂ.
  - hz0_in: z0 ∈ U.
  - hval: f z0 = c.
  - hder0: HasDerivAt f 0 z0, i.e., the complex derivative of f at z0 is 0.
- Conclusion (dichotomy):
  - Either (∀ z, f z = c) — f equals c everywhere on ℂ,
  - Or there exist m : ℕ and V ⊆ ℂ such that V is open, z0 ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and the set (f −1 {c}) ∩ V is finite.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The original statement: For a non-constant holomorphic f : U → ℂ on a domain U, if f(z0) = c and f'(z0) = 0, then either f(z) = c for all z ∈ U, or else if z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f −1(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicities).

Main discrepancies:
- Constancy quantification:
  - Lean uses (∀ z, f z = c) globally on ℂ for the first disjunct (and the negation of this as an assumption), while the original statement uses f = c on U only.
- The non-constancy assumption:
  - The original assumes ""f is not constant (on U)""; the Lean assumption is ¬(∀ z, f z = c), which is strictly about equality to a specific constant c and over all ℂ, not about being nonconstant on U. This is different and weaker in intent but stronger in scope (global).
- Missing order-of-zero linkage:
  - The original explicitly uses: if z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, then there is a neighborhood where the preimage consists of exactly m points (with multiplicities).
  - The Lean statement does not assume or assert anything about the order of the zero. It simply asserts existence of some m with no relation to the zero or the cardinality. The variable m is unused in any property; it is an arbitrary witness with no constraints.
- Exact multiplicity vs finiteness:
  - The original states ""exactly m points (counted with multiplicities)""; the Lean statement only concludes that the preimage intersected with V is finite, which is far weaker.
- Domain handling of derivative:
  - The Lean uses HasDerivAt f 0 z0 with f : ℂ → ℂ, paired with AnalyticOn ℂ f U. This modeling is acceptable (common in Mathlib) since z0 ∈ U and U is open, but it’s not the main source of discrepancy.

Step 3: Final check: Are the problems the same?
They are different.
- The Lean theorem’s dichotomy is mis-stated: it uses global constancy instead of constancy on U, and its second case only promises finiteness of solutions rather than exactly m solutions with multiplicities.
- It completely omits the crucial assumption and conclusion involving the order m of the zero of f − c at z0; the introduced m in the conclusion is not linked to anything and is effectively meaningless.
- The non-constancy assumption is incorrectly formulated relative to the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem injective_holomorphic_derivative_ne_zero {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (h_inj : Injective f) : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0 := ...`
  This states: Let U be an open subset of ℂ. Let f : ℂ → ℂ be a function that is complex-differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U), and assume f is injective on all of ℂ. Then for every z ∈ U, the (global) complex derivative deriv f z is nonzero.

Notes on technicalities:
- Using `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` is the Mathlib way to express “holomorphic on U.” Since U is open, this implies differentiable at each z ∈ U as a function on ℂ, so `deriv f z` is the usual complex derivative at z.
- The hypothesis `Injective f` asserts injectivity on the whole ℂ, not just on U.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original: f has domain U (f : U → ℂ), is holomorphic on U, and is injective (on U). Conclusion: f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean: f has domain ℂ (f : ℂ → ℂ), is holomorphic on U (DifferentiableOn on U), and is injective on all of ℂ. Conclusion: deriv f z ≠ 0 for z ∈ U.

Key difference:
- Injectivity: The original requires injectivity on U (i.e., as a function U → ℂ). The Lean code assumes global injectivity on ℂ. This is a stronger assumption than needed and is not equivalent to injectivity restricted to U. A faithful formalization should use `InjectiveOn f U` or define `f : U → ℂ` and assume `Injective` on that subtype.
- Domain: Using `f : ℂ → ℂ` with `DifferentiableOn` on U is a standard formalization of a function defined on U, but it must be paired with `InjectiveOn f U` to match the original statement.

3) Final check:
- Are they the same? No. The Lean theorem is a specialization that demands global injectivity, whereas the original only needs injectivity on U. Everything else (openness, holomorphicity, derivative nonvanishing for z ∈ U) aligns correctly. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only issue is the overly strong injectivity hypothesis.

Suggested fix for faithfulness:
- Replace `h_inj : Injective f` with `h_inj : InjectiveOn f U` and conclude `∀ z ∈ U, derivWithin f U z ≠ 0`, or, since U is open, use `deriv f z` after obtaining `DifferentiableAt` and use the equivalence between within and at derivatives in open sets. Alternatively, define `f : U → ℂ` and use `Injective f` on the subtype.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's definitions for complex numbers, conjugation, real part, and squared modulus.
- The comment matches the natural language statement.
- `theorem abs_add_sq_complex (a b : ℂ) : ... := by sorry` declares the theorem for arbitrary complex numbers `a, b`.
- `Complex.normSq (a + b)` denotes |a + b|^2 (the squared modulus of a + b). In Mathlib, `Complex.normSq z = re z ^ 2 + im z ^ 2 = ‖z‖^2 = |z|^2`.
- `Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b` denotes |a|^2 + |b|^2.
- `2 * Complex.re (a * Star.star b)` denotes 2 Re(a ⋅ conj b), since `Star.star b` is the complex conjugate of `b` and `Complex.re` is the real part.

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
The Lean statement is precisely |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b) for complex numbers a, b. It uses standard Mathlib notions (`normSq`, `re`, and `star` for conjugation). No extraneous hypotheses or generalizations appear.

3) Final check:
The mathematical content matches exactly: same domain (ℂ), same identity, same terms (squared modulus and real part with conjugate). There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing. Thus, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- Comment explains the intended statement.
- `theorem complex_abs_cos_ge_re (z : ℂ) : ‖Complex.cos z‖ ≥ ‖Complex.cos z.re‖ := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: for any complex number z, the complex modulus (norm) of the complex cosine of z is at least the complex modulus of the complex cosine of the real number z.re (the real part of z, coerced into ℂ). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, show |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
- In Lean, `‖Complex.cos z‖` is the modulus |cos z|. The right-hand side `‖Complex.cos z.re‖` treats Re z as a real coerced into ℂ, applies complex cosine, and then takes the complex modulus. Since for real inputs the complex cosine equals the real cosine (as a complex number with zero imaginary part), its complex modulus equals the real absolute value |cos(Re z)|. Thus the statement matches the intended inequality exactly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is recorded.

3) Final check:
- The Lean theorem type is essentially identical to the natural language statement, with the minor formalization detail that the right-hand side uses complex cosine of a real input and complex norm, which coincides with the real absolute value of cos(Re z). Hence they are the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to prove, for all z ∈ ℂ, the two inequalities |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean statements are exactly these, with Complex.abs as |·| and Real.exp for the exponential. The factor (1/2) is expressed as `(1 / 2 : ℝ)` and multiplication by `*`.
- There are no additional hypotheses or changes in the domain/codomain; both statements quantify over all complex numbers z.

3) Final check and differences:
- No differences in meaning or scope. The code does not introduce any auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The use of `sorry` is only in the proofs, which are not required for translation faithfulness. The statements match exactly.

- Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus |·|, `Complex.arctan` is the principal branch of complex arctangent, and `Real.pi / 4` is π/4. The right-hand side is exactly (π/4) * |z| / (1 - |z|).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * |z| / (1 - |z|).
- The Lean statement matches precisely: domain ℂ, hypothesis |z|<1, conclusion is the same inequality with the same quantities. The absolute value used is the complex modulus, and arctan is the complex arctangent, consistent with the intended meaning. The denominator 1 - |z| is positive under the hypothesis, so the expression is well-defined; the Lean statement does not need to assert this separately.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check:
- The two problems are the same. No extra assumptions or restrictions have been added; no generalization or specialization beyond the original statement. Notational correspondences are exact: π/4 ↔ `Real.pi / 4`, |·| ↔ `Complex.abs`, arctan ↔ `Complex.arctan`.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The theorem name `abs_csc_ge_abs_csc_re` states a property about the absolute value of the cosecant function for complex numbers.
- Input: `z : ℂ` means let z be a complex number.
- Hypotheses: `h1 : Complex.sin z ≠ 0` and `h2 : Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ) ≠ 0` ensure that both csc z and csc(Re z) are defined (since csc = 1/sin). In Lean, the expressions are written as `Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin z)` and `Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ))` representing |csc z| and |csc(Re z)| respectively.
- Conclusion: `≥` is exactly the inequality |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For z in ℂ, prove |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|.
- The Lean code formalizes exactly this inequality with the necessary domain assumptions that sin z ≠ 0 and sin(Re z) ≠ 0 so that csc is defined. This is a standard and acceptable formalization detail: the original statement implicitly requires the expressions to be defined. There are no extraneous definitions or placeholders; the code directly states the theorem.

3) Final check:
- Both statements assert the same inequality, with Lean adding the natural domain restrictions for defining csc on both sides. This is a faithful translation.

Note: Independently of faithfulness, mathematically the true inequality goes in the opposite direction (|sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)| implies |csc z| ≤ |csc(Re z)|), but the task is to check translation faithfulness, not correctness. The Lean code faithfully mirrors the given (possibly incorrect) inequality with appropriate definability assumptions.

- `open Complex` makes Complex namespace names (like `Complex.log`, `Complex.abs`) available without full qualification.
- `noncomputable section` allows use of noncomputable definitions (common when dealing with analysis/limits).
- The theorem `jirilebl_ca_ca_20226 (z : ℂ) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ...` states: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the following two inequalities hold: (i) `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), Complex.abs z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1)` and (ii) `∑' (n : ℕ), Complex.abs z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`. The two are combined with a logical conjunction `∧`.
- `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted (placeholder), but does not affect the statement.
- `end` closes the section.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Hypothesis matches: z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1 is exactly `z : ℂ` and `Complex.abs z < 1`.
- First inequality: |log(1 − z)| ≤ sum_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n. In Lean, the sum is written as `∑' (n : ℕ), |z|^(n+1)/(n+1)`, which is the same series with an index shift (n from 0 corresponds to original n+1 from 1). This is mathematically equivalent.
- Second inequality: sum_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|). This is exactly the statement in the code.
- The absolute value and log are the complex versions (`Complex.abs`, `Complex.log`), matching the complex-analytic context. For |z| < 1, 1 − z lies in the slit plane away from the branch cut, so the principal log used by `Complex.log` aligns with the intended series expansion context.
- The code asserts both inequalities simultaneously via `∧`, which is equivalent to the chain of inequalities in the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing of the series is shifted but equivalent.
- The use of the principal complex logarithm is appropriate for |z| < 1, so no mismatch there.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib. No effect on the statement.
- Comment: States the goal: a function f: ℂ → ℂ with f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1 never vanishes.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_1314 (f : Complex → Complex) (h_mul : ∀ z w, f (z + w) = f z * f w) (h0 : f 0 = 1) : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0 := by sorry`: This declares a theorem whose hypotheses are:
  • f is a function from Complex to Complex.
  • h_mul: for all z, w in ℂ, f(z + w) = f(z) * f(w).
  • h0: f(0) = 1.
  Conclusion: for all z in ℂ, f(z) ≠ 0.
  The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement itself is clear and precise.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
The natural language statement has two parts:
- A concrete instance: using properties of the exponential to show e^z ≠ 0.
- The general reformulation: if f satisfies f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z.
The Lean theorem exactly formalizes the general reformulation, with domain ℂ → ℂ and the stated functional equation plus f(0)=1 implying nonvanishing everywhere.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code does not mention exp specifically; it formalizes the “in other words” general statement. This matches the second sentence of the natural language statement precisely.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement. No mismatch in quantifiers or domains.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the intended general claim.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Setup imports and namespace; no mathematical content changes.
- `theorem sum_abs_geometric (z : ℂ) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) = Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of (|z|)^(n+1) equals |z| divided by (1 - |z|). The sum is taken in ℝ since Complex.abs z : ℝ.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show that ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z| / (1 - |z|).
- The Lean code sums ∑' n:ℕ (|z|)^(n+1), which is exactly the same series as ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n (just a reindexing with m = n+1). The hypothesis |z| < 1 is present. The conclusion matches the classical geometric series sum formula.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same mathematically. The index shift from n=1 to n=0 with exponent n+1 is equivalent. The objects (|z| as a real number), hypothesis (|z| < 1), and conclusion (|z|/(1-|z|)) all match. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Thus, the translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to prove two inequalities for all z ∈ ℂ: |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean code provides exactly these two statements as separate theorems, quantified over all z : ℂ, with the same constants and functions, using Complex.abs for |·| and Real.exp for e^{·}. This is a direct and faithful translation.

3) Final check – same or different?:
- The mathematical content of both Lean theorems matches the natural language claims exactly. There are no auxiliary or placeholder/vacuous definitions. Splitting the combined statement into two lemmas is a benign formatting choice. No discrepancies found.

- The theorem `abs_log_one_sub_le_tsum {z : ℂ} (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) :` asserts, under the hypothesis |z| < 1, the conjunction of two inequalities:
  (i) `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ)`

- `by sorry`: proof omitted. There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement is given.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypothesis |z| < 1 matches.
- The first inequality matches |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n; using ∑' over n : ℕ with the shift (n+1) exactly reindexes the sum from 1 to ∞. The docstring explicitly notes this.
- The second inequality matches ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|). The right-hand side is written as Complex.abs z / (1 − Complex.abs z), consistent since |z| is real.
- Combining the two inequalities with ∧ is equivalent to the chained inequality in the natural language.
- Using `Complex.log` (principal branch) is appropriate for |z| < 1, since 1 − z lies in the open right half-plane and avoids the branch cut; in Mathlib, `Complex.log` is total anyway. This does not change the mathematical meaning in this context.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions at all.

3) Final check: The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same mathematically. The only notational difference is the index shift for the infinite sum, which is explicitly acknowledged and standard. No discrepancies found.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Load the Mathlib library.
- `open Complex`: Use Complex namespace conveniences.
- `noncomputable def sec (z : ℂ) : ℂ := (Complex.cos z)⁻¹`: Define the complex secant function as sec(z) = (cos z)^{-1} for complex z. Note: in Lean, `inv 0 = 0`, so this is a total function, but it still reflects the intended algebraic definition 1/cos z.
- `theorem abs_sec_ge_abs_sec_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (sec z) ≥ Complex.abs (sec (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`: For any complex number z, the absolute value of sec z is greater than or equal to the absolute value of sec applied to the real part of z (coerced to ℂ). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Step 2: Assess if it matches the natural language statement.
The natural language statement is: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |sec z| ≥ |sec (Re z)|. The Lean theorem states exactly this, using Complex.abs for |·|, the defined sec as 1/cos on ℂ, and applying sec to (z.re : ℂ), which matches the intended meaning of sec(Re z) (the real argument coerced to complex yields the same value and absolute value).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only subtlety is that in classical mathematics sec is undefined where cos = 0, whereas the Lean definition uses the total inverse on ℂ (with inv 0 = 0). This is a standard formalization choice and does not constitute a vacuous or misleading definition; it remains a faithful representation of sec as 1/cos for the purposes of stating the inequality. There are no auxiliary vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definition of sec is legitimate and matches the intended concept.
- The statement quantifies over all z ∈ ℂ, matching the natural language.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens: We work in Complex numbers with Metric and Set notions from Mathlib.
- Theorem exists_smaller_value_in_ball_of_open_map: Fix z0 : ℂ, ε > 0, and a function p : ℂ → ℂ. Assume:
  • hopen: p is an open map on all of ℂ (IsOpenMap p),
  • hnonconst: p is nonconstant in the sense that there exists some z with p z ≠ p z0,
  • hpz0: p z0 ≠ 0.
  Then there exists w ∈ ball(z0, ε) such that |p w| < |p z0|.
- The docstring clarifies the intent: this formulation assumes open-mapping property; it notes that for nonconstant complex polynomials or holomorphic functions, this is satisfied by the open mapping theorem.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: p is a nonconstant complex polynomial, or more generally a nonconstant power series converging on the open disk {|z − z0| < ε}, and p(z0) ≠ 0. Then there exists w in that same disk with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- Code’s hypotheses differ substantially:
  • Domain: The natural statement allows p to be defined only on the disk of radius ε (power series with radius ε). The Lean theorem assumes p : ℂ → ℂ (globally defined on all of ℂ).
  • Regularity: The natural statement requires p to be holomorphic (polynomial or convergent power series on the disk). The Lean theorem requires only that p is an open map on ℂ. This is a different and stronger global assumption, not a direct encoding of holomorphic/polynomial-on-a-disk.
  • Nonconstant: The Lean statement uses the point-based condition ∃ z, p z ≠ p z0. This is effectively equivalent to nonconstant (for any z0), but is framed differently. This difference is minor and acceptable.
- Conclusion: Both conclude existence of w with |p w| < |p z0| inside the given ball/disk.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- No. The Lean statement does not formalize “p is a nonconstant polynomial or a nonconstant power series convergent on the disk”; instead, it assumes the global property “p is an open map on ℂ”. Moreover, the Lean theorem requires p to be defined on all of ℂ, whereas the natural statement only requires p to be defined (and holomorphic) on the disk. Therefore, while the conclusion matches, the hypotheses are not a faithful translation—they are a different, stronger, and global condition. The docstring acknowledges the connection via the open mapping theorem, but the formal statement itself is not the same as the original.

Given there are no vacuous placeholders and the conclusion matches, but the hypotheses and domain differ materially, this is not a faithful translation, though it is a reasonable generalization route. Hence not faithful overall, but close.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators` just set up the environment and summation notation.
- The theorem `complex.exp_series_error_bound (z : Complex) (n : Nat)` states a property for arbitrary complex number z and natural number n.
- Left-hand side: `Complex.abs ((Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => (z ^ k) / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z)` is |(sum_{k=0}^n z^k / k!) − e^z|. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` corresponds to k = 0, ..., n; `Nat.factorial k : ℂ` coerces the factorial to complex so the sum is in ℂ; `Complex.exp z` is e^z; `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus, returning a real.
- Right-hand side: `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (↑(Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is (|z|^(n+1) / (n+1)!) * e^{|z|}. Here the factorial is coerced to ℝ, and `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is e^{|z|}.
- The inequality `≤` compares real numbers, as both sides are in ℝ.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural statement says: For z in ℂ and all n in ℕ, |sum_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}. This exactly matches the Lean statement, including the summation bounds, the absolute value, the exponential functions (complex exp on the left, real exp of |z| on the right), and the factorial terms.

Step 3: Final check.
- Quantifiers match: the theorem takes arbitrary z and n.
- The expressions on both sides match the intended mathematical objects.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is directly stated. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing, as we're only checking the statement.

  Natural language: For all complex numbers z and w, we have
  4 z (conj w) = |z + w|^2 − |z − w|^2 + i( |z + i w|^2 − |z − i w|^2 ).

- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- They are the same statement. No generalization or restriction beyond the given identity for all complex z, w. Notational differences (star for conjugation, normSq for squared modulus, I for i) are standard and faithful.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language polarization identity.

- `theorem conformal_at_iff_hasDerivAt_ne_zero (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ) : ConformalAt f z0 ↔ (∃ f' : ℂ, HasDerivAt f f' z0 ∧ f' ≠ 0)`
  This states: For a function f : ℂ → ℂ and a point z0 ∈ ℂ, f is conformal at z0 if and only if there exists a complex number f' such that f has complex derivative f' at z0 (expressed as `HasDerivAt f f' z0`) and f' ≠ 0.
  No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced; all terms (ConformalAt, HasDerivAt) are standard Mathlib notions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose f is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 if and only if f'(z0) ≠ 0.”
- The Lean statement does not assume holomorphicity of f; instead, it uses the existential `∃ f', HasDerivAt f f' z0 ∧ f' ≠ 0`. This is a standard and slightly more general formulation: conformality at a point is equivalent to complex differentiability at that point with nonzero derivative. Under the holomorphic assumption, f'(z0) is well-defined and the existential quantifier simply picks `f' = f'(z0)`. Hence, within the holomorphic context, the Lean RHS is equivalent to “f'(z0) ≠ 0”.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a valid and faithful formalization, arguably a mild generalization that removes an unnecessary global hypothesis (holomorphic everywhere or on a neighborhood) and replaces it with the local condition of having a derivative at z0.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Mathematically, they assert the same local equivalence. The Lean code is slightly more general (it does not assume holomorphicity and phrases the derivative via an existence quantifier), but this is an acceptable and faithful strengthening of the original claim in the sense of standard formalization practice. There are no fake/vacuous definitions or mismatches of meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem schwarz_lemma states: Let f : ℂ → ℂ. Assume f is holomorphic (DifferentiableOn ℂ) on the open unit disk Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) (1 : ℝ) and f 0 = 0. Then for every z in the open unit disk, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖z‖.
- Here, holomorphic on the unit disk is encoded as DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1). The conclusion is ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball 0 1, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖z‖.
- There is no additional hypothesis on the values of f (e.g., that f(z) stays in the unit disk).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ 𝔻.
- Key components:
  - Domain: 𝔻 (open unit disk).
  - Codomain condition: f maps 𝔻 into 𝔻 (i.e., |f(z)| < 1 for all z in 𝔻).
  - Holomorphic on 𝔻.
  - f(0) = 0.
  - Conclusion: |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ 𝔻.
- The Lean statement matches the domain, holomorphicity, and f(0) = 0, but it omits the crucial assumption that f maps the disk into itself (or at least is bounded by 1 on the disk). Without this assumption, the conclusion is false (e.g., f(z) = 2z).

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem lacks the hypothesis that f(𝔻) ⊆ 𝔻 (or |f(z)| ≤ 1 on 𝔻). This is essential for Schwarz's lemma. Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.
- Minor acceptable differences:
  - f is defined on all of ℂ but only assumed holomorphic on the disk; this is a harmless generalization.
  - Using the norm ‖·‖ on ℂ instead of absolute value is standard.
- Main discrepancy: Missing mapping-into-disk assumption, making the statement incorrect as written.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

- The theorem: `theorem complex.abs_cos_ge_abs_cos_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : Complex)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of cos(z) is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of cos(Re z), where Re z is viewed as a complex number (i.e., coerced from ℝ to ℂ). Since cos of a real number, when considered as a complex function on a real input, yields a real value, the complex modulus equals the real absolute value.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: for all z ∈ ℂ, |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|. The use of `Complex.cos (z.re : Complex)` is a standard formalization; it matches cos(Re z) and taking `Complex.abs` corresponds to the modulus. This is a faithful translation.

3) Final check for differences:
- Natural language uses |·| for absolute value/modulus; Lean uses `Complex.abs`. On the right side, cos(Re z) is real, but coercing Re z to ℂ and using complex cos/modulus yields the same quantity. There are no auxiliary definitions or placeholders; the theorem statement is precise and matches the intended claim. The presence of `sorry` affects proof, not the statement. No discrepancies in quantifiers or inequalities. Thus, the problems are the same.

- `theorem abs_cos_ge_abs_cos_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos z.re) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of the complex cosine of z is at least as large as the complex modulus of the complex cosine of the real part of z (the real part coerced to a complex number). Since `Complex.cos` on a real input coincides with `Real.cos` embedded into ℂ, and `Complex.abs` on a real complex number equals the usual real absolute value, this states |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)| as intended.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The Lean statement quantifies over z : Complex and asserts exactly the inequality |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|. The use of `Complex.cos z.re` relies on implicit coercion ℝ → ℂ, so it means cos evaluated at the real part viewed as a complex number. The absolute values are complex moduli, which agree with real absolute value on real numbers. Hence the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The only difference is formalization detail: using `Complex.cos` and `Complex.abs` consistently; this matches the mathematical meaning. There are no mismatches in quantifiers or objects. Therefore, the two statements are the same.

- {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U): f is a function ℂ → ℂ that is complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic on U). In Mathlib, DifferentiableOn uses within-differentiability, but since U is open, this coincides with ordinary differentiability at each z ∈ U.
- (hinj : ∀ x y, x ∈ U → y ∈ U → f x = f y → x = y): f is injective on U (equivalent to injOn f U).
- conclusion: ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0: For every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero. Since U is open and f is DifferentiableOn U, f is differentiable at each z ∈ U, so deriv f z is the usual complex derivative at z.
- by sorry: Proof omitted; acceptable here since we only audit the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean statement: Exactly captures this, with the formalization that f is a function ℂ → ℂ, assumed holomorphic (DifferentiableOn) and injective on U. The open hypothesis ensures within- and at- differentiability agree, so deriv f z is the usual derivative. The injectivity restriction is on U, matching the statement. The conclusion matches f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: The natural language has f : U → ℂ; the Lean code uses f : ℂ → ℂ but restricts properties to U. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- Holomorphic vs DifferentiableOn: For complex functions on an open set, these are aligned in Mathlib; DifferentiableOn ℂ f U with U open corresponds to holomorphic on U.
- Injectivity: Expressed via quantified condition on U, equivalent to injective on U.
- Derivative notion: deriv f z in Lean is the complex derivative at z (since differentiable at z on open U). Conclusion matches f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
No discrepancies or vacuous definitions. The code uses standard Mathlib notions faithfully.

Overall, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number z with hypothesis |z| < 1, and concludes the inequality |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|). Here `Complex.log` is the principal branch of the complex logarithm, and `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language: domain ℂ, hypothesis |z| < 1, conclusion |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|). The use of Complex.log (principal branch) is standard and well-defined under the hypothesis since 1 − z ≠ 0 when |z| < 1.

- `theorem holomorphic_nonzero_deriv_locally_injective {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ}`: We are stating a theorem for an open set U in the complex plane and a function f from ℂ to ℂ.
- Hypotheses:
  - `(hU : IsOpen U)`: U is open.
  - `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
  - `(h' : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0)`: For every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.
- Conclusion:
  - `∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ z ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y)`
    For every z in U, there exists an open set V containing z, with V contained in U, such that f is injective on V (expressed by: for all x, y in V, if f x = f y then x = y).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U. Show f is locally injective on U.
- Lean formulation uses f: ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U instead of f: U → ℂ; this is the standard Mathlib way to encode a function defined on U. The derivative condition `deriv f z ≠ 0` for z ∈ U matches the nonvanishing derivative assumption. The conclusion gives, for each z ∈ U, an open neighborhood V ⊆ U where f is injective, which is exactly “locally injective on U.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Slight formal difference: f is taken as ℂ → ℂ rather than U → ℂ, but all properties and conclusions are restricted to U. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- The conclusion is even a bit stronger (V is explicitly open), which is compatible with the notion of a neighborhood and matches the intent.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just a theorem statement with appropriate Mathlib notions.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in Mathlib.
- The module docstring explains the setup: viewing ℂ as ℝ^2 with basis (1, i), the real-linear map z ↦ ξ z + ζ conj(z) has the 2×2 real matrix
  [ ξ.re + ζ.re    ζ.im - ξ.im ]
  [ ξ.im + ζ.im    ξ.re - ζ.re ]
  and claims its determinant is |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- The theorem `det_of_complex_map (ξ ζ : ℂ)` states the scalar identity
  (ξ.re + ζ.re) * (ξ.re − ζ.re) − (ζ.im − ξ.im) * (ξ.im + ζ.im) = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
  This left-hand side is exactly the determinant formula a d − b c for the displayed 2×2 matrix, with a = ξ.re + ζ.re, b = ζ.im − ξ.im, c = ξ.im + ζ.im, d = ξ.re − ζ.re. The right-hand side is the difference of squared moduli.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: if M is the 2×2 real matrix representing the real-linear map z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z}, then det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2. The code’s theorem states exactly the determinant (expanded as a d − b c) of the specific matrix computed from ξ, ζ equals |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2. While the theorem does not explicitly introduce the matrix M or the real-linear map within Lean, the docstring specifies the matrix entries, and the theorem proves the determinant identity corresponding to that matrix. Thus, mathematically it captures the same content: the determinant of the representing matrix equals |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.

3) Final check and differences:
- Same mathematical claim: yes, the LHS is precisely det of the matrix arising from the given real-linear map, and the RHS is |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- Minor presentational difference: the code does not formalize the real-linear map or the matrix object or `Matrix.det` explicitly; it proves the determinant identity in expanded coordinates. This is a faithful restatement, not a different problem.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful, with a small stylistic gap (no explicit matrix/determinant objects), but the equality proved is precisely the required result.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex Metric` are setup lines.
- The theorem `schwarz_lemma_unit_disk` declares a function `f : ℂ → ℂ` and assumptions:
  - `hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1)`: f is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on the open unit ball centered at 0, i.e., the unit disk 𝔻.
  - `hmap : ∀ z, z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1 → f z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1`: f maps the unit disk into itself (for every z in 𝔻, f z is in 𝔻).
  - `h0 : f 0 = 0`: f fixes 0.
- Conclusion: `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1`: the modulus of the complex derivative of f at 0 is at most 1.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1."" This is the Schwarz lemma conclusion about the derivative at 0.
- The Lean statement takes f defined on ℂ but requires holomorphicity only on 𝔻 and that f maps 𝔻 into 𝔻. This is a standard formalization strategy (extrinsic domain), equivalent in content to f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 holomorphic.
- Since `Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1` is open, `DifferentiableOn` on that set implies `DifferentiableAt` at all points in it, particularly at 0, so `deriv f 0` is meaningful.
- The mapping condition `hmap` matches ""f : 𝔻 → 𝔻"" in the natural statement.
- The conclusion matches exactly: `|f'(0)| ≤ 1` as `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1`.

Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain/codomain are expressed extrinsically in Lean vs intrinsically in the natural statement; this is a harmless and standard reformulation, not a weakening or strengthening of the mathematical content.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib ones.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

The Lean statements quantify over arbitrary z : ℂ and assert exactly these inequalities using Complex.abs for modulus and Real.exp for e^{·}. The factor 1/2 is expressed as `(1 / 2)` and multiplication is clear. This is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check/comparison:

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- `theorem abs_tanh_le_tanh_abs_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.tanh z) ≤ Real.tanh (abs z.re) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of tanh z is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic tangent of the absolute value of the real part of z. Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus |·|, `Complex.tanh` is the complex hyperbolic tangent, `z.re` is the real part of z, and `Real.tanh` is the real tanh. The `abs` around `z.re` is the real absolute value.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: For z in C, show that |tanh z| ≤ tanh |Re z|. The Lean statement exactly mirrors this: domain ℂ, left-hand side is the modulus of the complex tanh, right-hand side is tanh of the absolute value of the real part. There are no extra hypotheses or changes.

3) Final check:
The math problems are the same. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement matching the original claim. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task focused on the statement's faithfulness.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `theorem complex_normsq_add (a b : ℂ) : ... := by sorry` states a theorem for arbitrary complex numbers `a` and `b`.
- `Complex.normSq (a + b)` denotes the squared modulus |a + b|^2 (in Mathlib, `Complex.normSq z = z.re^2 + z.im^2 = |z|^2`).
- `Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b` is |a|^2 + |b|^2.
- `(starRingEnd ℂ) b` applies the star (in ℂ, complex conjugation) to `b`, i.e., `(starRingEnd ℂ) b = conj b = \bar b`.
- `(a * (starRingEnd ℂ) b).re` is the real part Re(a · \bar b).
- `2 * (a * (starRingEnd ℂ) b).re` is 2 Re(a \bar b), a real number.
So the statement is exactly: for all a, b ∈ ℂ, |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: For a, b ∈ ℂ, |a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b). The Lean statement matches this precisely, with `Complex.normSq` representing |·|^2 and `starRingEnd ℂ` representing complex conjugation.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Both sides use ℂ and the same identity.
- `Complex.normSq` is exactly squared modulus.
- `starRingEnd ℂ` is complex conjugation; `.re` is real part. No mismatch.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Whole translation assessment:
- The two Lean theorem statements exactly express the two inequalities in the natural language statement, splitting them into two separate theorems. The types and functions correspond correctly: |·| is Complex.abs (a real-valued norm), e^{|z|} is Real.exp (Complex.abs z), and the factor 1/2 is expressed as (1 / 2 : ℝ) * ... .

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For z in C, prove |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean statement asserts exactly these two inequalities for any complex z, packaged as a conjunction. It uses Complex.abs for |·| and Real.exp for the exponential, applied to Complex.abs z, which corresponds to e^{|z|}. The factor (1/2) is the same. There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; only the theorem statement is present.

- Both inequalities match exactly, including constants and domains (z : Complex).

  This declares a theorem: For complex numbers z and w, assuming h: ‖z‖ = ‖w‖ (their complex norms are equal), we have the equivalence `‖z + w‖ = ‖z - w‖` if and only if `(z * star w).re = 0`. Here `star w` is the complex conjugate of w, and `.re` extracts the real part. In ℂ, `‖·‖` is the usual absolute value. Thus this states: If |z| = |w|, then |z + w| = |z − w| if and only if the real part of z·conj(w) is zero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For z, w ∈ ℂ with |z| = |w|, one has |z + w| = |z − w| iff z·\bar w is purely imaginary.
- In ℂ, ""purely imaginary"" is equivalent to having real part 0. The Lean code expresses this as `(z * star w).re = 0`. The rest matches exactly: the hypothesis `‖z‖ = ‖w‖`, and the equivalence `‖z + w‖ = ‖z − w‖ ↔ ...`.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorem precisely restates the given claim, using standard Mathlib notions: complex norm, complex conjugation (`star`), and real part (`.re`). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The only difference is formal notation. Hence the translation is faithful.

- theorem complex_norm_geometric_sum (z : ℂ) (hz : ‖z‖ < 1) : ∑' n : ℕ, ‖z‖ ^ n = ‖z‖ / (1 - ‖z‖) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n in ℕ (i.e., n = 0,1,2,...) of |z|^n equals |z|/(1 - |z|). Note: ‖z‖ is real, so this is a real-valued series; ∑' n : ℕ includes n = 0 by Mathlib convention.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: sum from n = 1 to ∞ of |z|^n equals |z|/(1 - |z|).
- Lean code: sum from n = 0 to ∞ of |z|^n equals |z|/(1 - |z|).
- This is a mismatch in the index: the Lean code includes the n = 0 term (which is 1), whereas the natural language sum starts at n = 1 and thus excludes 1. The correct Lean rendition could be, for example, ∑' n : ℕ, ‖z‖^(n+1) = ‖z‖/(1 - ‖z‖), or equivalently ∑' n : ℕ, ‖z‖^n = 1 / (1 - ‖z‖).

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean code asserts a statement about the series starting at n = 0, while the natural language statement is about the series starting at n = 1. This is a substantive difference.
- Other aspects (domain ℂ, condition |z| < 1, working with norms) match.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful due to the starting index discrepancy.

The proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement:
- Domain: z ∈ ℂ is represented by `(z : ℂ)`.
- Left-hand side: `|cos z|` is `Complex.abs (Complex.cos z)`.
- Right-hand side: `cosh(Im z)` is `Real.cosh (Complex.im z)`.
There are no auxiliary definitions; all functions are the standard Mathlib ones.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. No differences in quantifiers, domains, or functions. The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem abs_csc_ge_re (z : ℂ) : (1 / Complex.sin z).abs ≥ (1 / Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ)).abs := by ...`
  In words: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of 1/sin z is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of 1/sin(Re z). Here `(z.re : ℂ)` is the coercion of the real part of z into a complex number, so `Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ)` equals the usual real sine of Re z, viewed in ℂ. The expression `1 / Complex.sin ...` is exactly csc of the argument, and `.abs` is the complex absolute value. Thus the statement is |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|. The Lean theorem states exactly this, interpreting csc as 1/sin and absolute value as complex modulus. The use of `(z.re : ℂ)` matches taking the real part and then viewing it as a complex number. There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; it’s a direct theorem statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Both the natural language and Lean statements assert the same inequality for all complex z. A minor technical note: in Lean, 1/0 is defined as 0 (via inv 0 = 0), so csc is totalized; in classical notation csc is undefined at zeros of sin. However, the set of z where sin z = 0 coincides with the set where sin(Re z) = 0, so the inequality in Lean remains consistent at those points (both sides become 0). This is a standard formalization detail and does not change the intended meaning. No other discrepancies.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem complex_log_geom_bound (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry` defines a theorem whose hypotheses are z : ℂ and |z| < 1, and whose conclusion is a conjunction of two inequalities:
  • `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ (∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ))`
  • `(∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ (Complex.abs z) / ((1 : ℝ) - Complex.abs z))`
  Here `∑' n : ℕ, (|z|)^(n+1)/(n+1)` is exactly the real series ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k, just reindexed from n = 0.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The hypothesis matches: z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1.
- The first inequality exactly matches |log(1−z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n, using the principal complex logarithm and real absolute value on the left, and a real nonnegative series on the right.
- The second inequality exactly matches ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1−|z|).
- Packaging the two inequalities as a conjunction is equivalent to the chain of inequalities in the natural language.
- The reindexing with n+1 over ℕ is a standard way to express a sum starting at 1, so it's faithful.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof. This is acceptable for translation auditing.

3) Final check for differences:
- Complex vs real log: The statement is for z ∈ ℂ, so using Complex.log is appropriate.
- The series is correctly over ℝ with terms (|z|)^(n+1)/(n+1), matching ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n.
- The bound |z|/(1−|z|) is correctly typed over ℝ. No discrepancy in constants or indices.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem log_one_sub_series {z : ℂ} (hz : ‖z‖ < 1) :` says: For a complex number z with norm (absolute value) less than 1,
- `Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' (n : ℕ), z^(n+1) / (n+1 : ℂ)` states that the principal complex logarithm of (1 - z) equals the negative of the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of z^(n+1) divided by (n+1) (viewed as a complex number). The `∑'` denotes the (possibly infinite) sum (tsum) over all natural numbers.

Interpreting the sum: `∑' (n : ℕ) z^(n+1)/(n+1)` is the same as `∑_{m=1}^∞ z^m/m` by the index shift m = n+1. Thus the Lean statement reads as log(1 − z) = −∑_{m=1}^∞ z^m/m under ‖z‖ < 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1. Prove that log(1 − z) = −∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n.
- Lean: Exactly the same, with the minor notational shift of summing over n:ℕ with n+1 inside the terms. The use of Complex.log (principal branch) is appropriate on the domain ‖z‖ < 1, since then 1 − z has positive real part and avoids the branch cut, matching the standard series expansion.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: both assume z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1.
- Expression: both claim log(1 − z) equals the negative of the series ∑ z^n/n from n = 1 to ∞. The Lean version uses an equivalent reindexing.
- No extraneous hypotheses or missing conditions. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the code simply states the theorem.

  Natural language: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite series sum over n=0..∞ of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1) is ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|). Since ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^(n+1)/(n+1) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k, this matches the target series.

  Concretely:
  • Finset.range (n+1) denotes the set {0, 1, ..., n}, so the sum matches ∑_{k=0}^n.
  • z ^ k / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ) is z^k divided by k!, coerced into ℂ; matches the complex series terms.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The Lean statement is exactly the natural language inequality: for all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, the difference between the exponential and its nth Taylor partial sum is bounded by |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem maximum_modulus_local_const {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) {z0 : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U)`
  This sets up: U is an open subset of the complex plane, f: ℂ → ℂ is complex differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U), and z0 ∈ U.
- `(hmax : ∃ r > 0, Metric.ball z0 r ⊆ U ∧ ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball z0 r, norm (f z) ≤ norm (f z0))` 
  There exists r > 0 such that the open ball B(z0, r) is contained in U and for all z in that ball, |f(z)| ≤ |f(z0)|. This formalizes that |f| attains a local maximum at z0 (on a neighborhood contained in U).
- Conclusion: `∃ r > 0, Metric.ball z0 r ⊆ U ∧ ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball z0 r, f z = f z0`
  There exists r > 0 such that B(z0, r) ⊆ U and f is constant on that ball, i.e., f(z) = f(z0) for all z in the ball. This is exactly “f is constant in a neighborhood of z0”.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn over ℂ, Metric.ball, norm).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open and f: U → ℂ holomorphic. If |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U, prove that f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
Lean: Exactly matches these hypotheses and conclusion. The local maximum is expressed with an explicit ball contained in U, which is a standard and equivalent formalization of “local maximum”. The conclusion is existence of a (possibly smaller) ball on which f is constant.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain/codomain: Correct (ℂ → ℂ, holomorphic on U via DifferentiableOn ℂ f U).
- Openness of U: Present.
- Local maximum: Precisely captured by existence of r > 0 with ball contained in U and the modulus inequality on that ball.
- Conclusion: f constant on some neighborhood (ball) of z0 within U. Matches the natural language.
No discrepancies or extraneous restrictions. No vacuous placeholders. This is a faithful translation.

- `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is complex-differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U in the usual sense since U is open).
- `(hfi : Injective f)`: f is injective as a function on all of ℂ (global injectivity).
- Conclusion `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`: For every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement assumes f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective (injective on U), and concludes f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U.
- The Lean statement assumes f : ℂ → ℂ, is holomorphic on U, and is injective on all of ℂ, then concludes the same nonvanishing derivative on U.
- The holomorphic-on-U part is faithful (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U with U open).
- However, the domain and injectivity hypotheses are stronger: the Lean code requires f be defined on ℂ and globally injective, rather than just injective on U. It does not use Injective on U (e.g., `InjOn f U` or `Injective (fun x : U => f x)`).

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem is a specialization/strengthening of the original statement (stronger assumptions). It does not capture the full generality of “f : U → ℂ injective,” because one cannot, in general, extend f to an injective function on all of ℂ.
- Therefore, while close, it is not a faithful translation of the original statement.

No vacuous placeholders or bogus auxiliary definitions are present; the only issue is the strengthened assumptions (global domain and global injectivity) versus the intended local ones on U.

Assessment vs. the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that arctan' z = 1/(1+z^2) and log'(z) = 1/z where defined.”
- The Lean statements explicitly assert the derivative identities at any point z under the hypothesis that the function is differentiable at z. This matches “where defined.”
- arctan is taken to be the principal branch via the principal log; this is a standard realization of complex arctan, and the derivative identity holds wherever the function is differentiable. The log case is likewise the principal branch, with the correct derivative where differentiable.
- There are no vacuous placeholder definitions: `arctan_complex` is a concrete, standard definition; `Complex.log` is Mathlib’s principal log. Theorems are stated in terms of `HasDerivAt`, which directly corresponds to the derivative value at a point.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches exactly: both derivative formulas are asserted at points where the respective functions are differentiable. No extraneous conditions are added, and no parts of the original statement are omitted.
- Slight formalization detail: specifying the principal branches is natural in complex analysis and consistent with “where defined.”

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line to natural language.
- We work with permutations of Fin n (i.e., the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}), which is a standard formalization of Sym_n.
- Hypothesis hn : 1 < n enforces n ≥ 2, matching the statement’s n ≥ 2.
- β : Perm (Fin n) together with hβ says β is the n-cycle j ↦ j+1 mod n (in 0-based indexing: 0 ↦ 1 ↦ 2 ↦ ... ↦ n-1 ↦ 0).
- The variable i : ℕ with 1 < i and i < n corresponds to 1 < i < n in the statement.

First theorem (conjugate_adjacent_transposition):
- Left-hand side: Equiv.swap (i-1) i in 0-based indexing. This is the adjacent transposition (i-1, i), which corresponds to (i, i+1) in 1-based indexing.
- Right-hand side: (β ^ (i - 1)) * swap(0,1) * (β ^ (n - (i - 1))). Here swap(0,1) corresponds to α = (1 2) in 1-based indexing. The product is conjugation by β^(i-1), except the final exponent is written as n - (i - 1) instead of −(i − 1).
- Thus the theorem states (i, i+1) = β^(i-1) α β^(n - i + 1), which is one of the equalities in the natural language statement.

Second theorem (conjugate_adjacent_transposition_pow_relation):
- Adds α and assumes hα : α = swap(0,1), and assumes hβn : β ^ n = 1.
- Concludes (β^(i - 1)) * α * (β ^ (-(i - 1))) = (β^(i - 1)) * α * (β ^ (n - i + 1)). This formalizes the relation β^{-(i-1)} = β^{n - i + 1} inside the conjugation, given β^n = 1.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The statement claims for 1 < i < n: (i, i+1) = β^(i-1) α β^{-(i-1)} = β^(i-1) α β^{n - i + 1}.
- The first theorem proves (i, i+1) = β^(i-1) α β^{n - i + 1} (in 0-based indexing and using Equiv.swap). The second theorem shows β^(i-1) α β^{-(i-1)} equals β^(i-1) α β^{n - i + 1} under β^n = 1. Combining them yields exactly the chain of equalities in the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Indexing: Lean uses 0..n-1 (Fin n) whereas the statement uses 1..n (Sym_n). The code adjusts by using swap(i-1, i), which matches (i, i+1) in 1-based; this is faithful.
- The first theorem uses β^(n - (i - 1)) instead of β^{-(i-1)}, but the second theorem bridges the two forms using β^n = 1. This matches the statement’s second equality.
- All auxiliary components (β defined via its action, α as swap(0,1)) are legitimate; no vacuous placeholders are introduced. Proofs are omitted via sorry, which is acceptable per the instructions.
- The slight separation into two theorems rather than one chained equality is fine and still faithfully represents the content.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib; open Set Metric: Bring in mathlib and open set/metric namespaces.
- Theorem zeros_of_deriv_discrete: Given
  - U : Set ℂ and hU : IsOpen U (U is an open subset of ℂ),
  - f : ℂ → ℂ,
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (f is complex-differentiable on U),
  - hnonconst : ∃ z w, z ∈ U ∧ w ∈ U ∧ f z ≠ f w (f is not constant on U),
  then
  - ∀ z ∈ {z : ℂ | z ∈ U ∧ deriv f z = 0}, ∃ r > 0, (ball z r ∩ U ∩ {w | deriv f w = 0}) = {z}.
  This means: for every point z in U where the complex derivative of f is zero, there exists a radius r > 0 such that the open ball centered at z of radius r, intersected with U and with the zero set of the derivative, contains only z. This is precisely the notion that the zero set of f' in U is discrete in U (expressed using balls in the ambient metric space and intersecting with U to reflect the relative topology).

Step 2: Assess overall faithfulness
- The natural language statement: U open in ℂ, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f not constant, then {z ∈ U : f'(z) = 0} is discrete in U.
- The Lean code models f as a global function ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, which is the standard way to formalize a holomorphic function on an open subset U. The nonconstancy assumption matches (two points in U with distinct images). The set is exactly {z ∈ U | deriv f z = 0}. Discreteness in U is expressed as: for each z in the set, there is an r > 0 with (ball z r ∩ U ∩ zero-set) = {z}, i.e., an open neighborhood in ℂ whose intersection with U and the set isolates z. This is the correct relative notion of discreteness in U.
- Using deriv f (as opposed to a derivative within U) is appropriate because U is open and DifferentiableOn on U ensures differentiability at each z ∈ U; deriv f z is the standard complex derivative at z and does not cause a mismatch. Intersecting with U ensures we are looking at discreteness relative to U.

Step 3: Compare for differences
- Domain representation: f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U vs. f : U → ℂ holomorphic; these are standardly equivalent for formalization purposes.
- Neighborhood choice: using ball in ℂ and intersecting with U corresponds to open neighborhoods in the subspace topology on U.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no mismatches in quantifiers or predicates.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  • U is a subset of ℂ, p is a point in ℂ, f is a function ℂ → ℂ.
  • Assumptions: U is open; p ∈ U; f is complex-differentiable on U (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U); the complex derivative at p (deriv f p) is nonzero.
  • Conclusion: There exists an open set V in ℂ with p ∈ V and V ⊆ U such that for all x,y ∈ V, if f x = f y then x = y; i.e., f is injective on V. This exactly asserts that there is an open neighborhood V of p (contained in U) on which the restriction of f is injective.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open, p ∈ U, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, and f′(p) ≠ 0. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that f|_V is injective.
- Lean version assumes f : ℂ → ℂ but only differentiable on U; it additionally concludes V ⊆ U. This is the standard formalization: treating f as a globally defined function and only using its differentiability on U. Since V ⊆ U is provided, this exactly matches the intended restriction f|_V. 
- The derivative condition uses deriv f p (the usual complex derivative). Because U is open and p ∈ U, DifferentiableOn ℂ f U implies differentiable at p as a function on ℂ, so deriv f p matches f′(p) in the natural language. Thus the hypothesis hder corresponds precisely to f′(p) ≠ 0.
- The conclusion states injectivity on some open neighborhood V of p contained in U, which is the same as saying the restriction of f to V is injective.

3) Final check for differences:
- Slight formalization change: f is globally defined on ℂ in Lean instead of U, but restricted differentiability on U and the explicit V ⊆ U ensure equivalence to the original setting f: U → ℂ.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all assumptions are standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn, deriv). The theorem asserts exactly the local injectivity conclusion.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Grade justification: The translation captures all hypotheses and the exact conclusion (local injectivity on an open neighborhood contained in U) with standard Mathlib notions, without vacuous placeholders. No material discrepancies.

- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The docstring explains the intended meanings: in Mathlib, ""holomorphic on U"" is expressed as `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` and ""analytic on U"" as `AnalyticOn ℂ f U`.
- `theorem holomorphic_on_implies_analytic_on {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) : AnalyticOn ℂ f U := by sorry`
  Natural language: If U is an open subset of the complex plane and f is complex-differentiable on U, then f is analytic on U.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: Let U ⊆ ℂ be a domain (typically: open and connected) and f: U → ℂ holomorphic. Show f is analytic on U; that is, f has a Taylor series expansion around each point with radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity, and the series sums to f.
- The Lean theorem asserts: If U is open and f is holomorphic on U, then f is analytic on U (in Mathlib’s sense `AnalyticOn`). This captures the implication ""holomorphic implies analytic."" It does not require connectedness, which is fine as a harmless generalization of the hypothesis.
- However, the NL statement’s parenthetical clarification explicitly includes the precise radius-of-convergence being equal to the distance to the nearest singularity. The Lean statement does not encode any assertion about the radius of convergence or nearest singularities. `AnalyticOn` guarantees local power series expansions that sum to f on a neighborhood, but it does not specify the exact radius equals the distance to the nearest singularity.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Similar core: both assert holomorphic implies analytic.
- Differences:
  - The NL statement includes the stronger claim about the radius of convergence equalling the distance to the nearest singularity; the Lean statement does not capture this at all.
  - The NL assumes U is a domain (open and connected); the Lean code only assumes open. This is a mild generalization and not an issue by itself.
- Conclusion: The Lean theorem captures only part of the natural language statement (holomorphic ⇒ analytic) and omits the radius-of-convergence characterization. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the full statement.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present; the theorem statement is legitimate but incomplete relative to the NL claim. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task since we only judge the statement, not the proof.

- The natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that f(V) is open and f|_V is injective.
- The Lean version models f as ℂ → ℂ but only assumes differentiability on U via DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, which is standard in mathlib. The inclusion V ⊆ U ensures we are restricting to the domain where f is holomorphic, matching f : U → ℂ in the informal statement.
- The derivative condition f'(p) ≠ 0 is encoded as fderiv ℂ f p ≠ 0, which in ℂ coincides with the scalar derivative being nonzero since the Fréchet derivative is multiplication by f'(p).
- The conclusion explicitly provides an open neighborhood V of p (IsOpen V and p ∈ V), with V ⊆ U, such that f(V) is open and f is injective on V. This matches the statement exactly.

Step 3: Final comparison
- The only mild formalization difference is that f is globally defined ℂ → ℂ instead of f : U → ℂ, but the use of DifferentiableOn on U and the conclusion V ⊆ U makes this a faithful formalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are made; the statement is a direct formalization of the theorem with no cheating.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- Theorem signature: `theorem holomorphic_identity (IsHolomorphicOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop) ...` introduces an arbitrary predicate `IsHolomorphicOn` on functions and sets, not tied to Mathlib’s actual notion of holomorphicity. This universally quantifies over any such predicate.
- `{U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U)`: U is an open subset of ℂ.
- `{f g : ℂ → ℂ}`: f and g are functions from ℂ to ℂ (not restricted-domain functions `U → ℂ`).
- `(hf : IsHolomorphicOn f U) (hg : IsHolomorphicOn g U)`: Hypotheses that f and g satisfy the arbitrary predicate `IsHolomorphicOn` on U.
- `{S : Set ℂ} (hS : S ⊆ U)`: S is a subset of U.
- `{z0 : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U)`: Choose a point z0 in U.
- `(hacc : z0 ∈ closure (S \ {z0}))`: z0 is an accumulation point of S (encoded as membership in the closure of S minus z0) in the ambient topology of ℂ. Since U is open and z0 ∈ U, this matches “accumulation point in U”.
- `(heq : ∀ z ∈ S, f z = g z)`: f and g agree on S.
- Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z`: f and g agree everywhere on U.

Faithfulness assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open; f, g: U → ℂ holomorphic; S ⊆ U has an accumulation point in U; f = g on S; conclude f ≡ g on U.
- Matches:
  - U open in ℂ and S ⊆ U are present.
  - Accumulation point condition is captured by `z0 ∈ U` and `z0 ∈ closure (S \ {z0})`, which is equivalent for open U.
  - Equality on S and conclusion equality on all of U match.
- Critical mismatch:
  - The notion of “holomorphic” is not used; instead, the theorem is stated for an arbitrary predicate `IsHolomorphicOn`. This makes the statement claim: for any predicate P on functions, if f and g both satisfy P on U and agree on a set with an accumulation point, then they are equal on U. That is not faithful to the identity theorem and is far too strong/underdetermined. It is not merely a “slight generalization”; it changes the mathematical content fundamentally. The docstring acknowledges avoiding a Mathlib name, but that results in an essentially vacuous or arbitrary hypothesis.
  - f, g are defined on ℂ rather than on U. This is acceptable in formalization (one can talk about functions on ℂ that are holomorphic on U), so this part is fine.

Final comparison:
- The two problems are different: the Lean statement is universally quantified over an arbitrary predicate instead of the specific holomorphic predicate from Mathlib, so it does not faithfully formalize the identity theorem for holomorphic functions.

Grade rationale:
- No auxiliary fake definitions were introduced, but the key holomorphic notion is replaced by an arbitrary parameter, which breaks faithfulness. If `IsHolomorphicOn` were replaced by Mathlib’s actual `HolomorphicOn` (or an equivalent well-defined notion), the statement would be faithful. This aligns with the rubric’s “makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful” → grade around 6.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and declares a predicate variable `IsHolomorphicOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop`. This is an arbitrary, user-supplied predicate intended to stand in for the notion “f is holomorphic on U”. It is not Mathlib’s actual holomorphicity/analyticity predicate.

- Theorem `zero_set_isolated`:
  Hypotheses: `U : Set ℂ`, `IsOpen U`, `f : ℂ → ℂ`, `IsHolomorphicOn f U`, and `c : ℂ`.
  Statement: For every `p` with `p ∈ U` and `f p = c`, there exists `δ > 0` such that `Metric.ball p δ ∩ (U ∩ {z | f z = c}) = {p}`. In words: each solution p of f(z)=c in U is isolated; i.e., the zero set in U is discrete in the sense that each of its points is isolated by a ball intersecting the zero set only at p.

- Theorem `local_zero_factorization`:
  Hypotheses: same `U`, `IsOpen U`, `f : ℂ → ℂ`, `IsHolomorphicOn f U`, and points `p ∈ U` with `f p = c`.
  Statement: There exists `δ > 0`, and there exist `k : ℕ` and `g : ℂ → ℂ` such that `IsHolomorphicOn g (Metric.ball p δ)`, and for all `z` in `Metric.ball p δ`, `f z - c = (z - p)^k * g z`, and `g p ≠ 0`. This is the usual Weierstrass preparation-like local factorization: f(z)−c factors as a power of (z−p) times a holomorphic function nonvanishing at p. The text also mentions “g is not identically zero”; this is implied by `g p ≠ 0`, so the code’s condition is stronger.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Domain and openness: Matches. The code treats `f : ℂ → ℂ` holomorphic on `U` rather than `f : U → ℂ`, which is a standard harmless reformulation.
- Discreteness: The code states exactly that each point in the zero set is isolated by some open ball intersecting the zero set only at that point, which captures the standard meaning of a discrete subset.
- Local factorization: The code states existence of δ>0, k∈ℕ, and a function g, holomorphic on the ball, with `f(z) - c = (z - p)^k * g(z)` for all z in the ball, and `g p ≠ 0`. This matches the intended factorization and nonvanishing condition. The phrase “k is fixed” in the natural language means there exists some integer k; the code uses an existential quantifier for k, which is appropriate.

Crucial issue (faithfulness):
- The code introduces a dummy predicate `IsHolomorphicOn` as a variable, not Mathlib’s actual analytic/holomorphic predicate (such as `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` or `HolomorphicOn`). This makes the theorems statements about an arbitrary predicate rather than about holomorphic functions. Therefore, the formalization does not genuinely express ""holomorphic"" as used in the natural language statement.
- This is explicitly acknowledged in the comment: “We declare a dummy predicate `IsHolomorphicOn` to represent holomorphicity…” Hence, the auxiliary predicate is a placeholder, not a faithful Mathlib concept. Per the guidelines, this is a red flag and causes the translation to fail.

Other notes:
- Using `Metric.ball p δ` to describe the disk Δ_δ(p) is fine.
- Not explicitly stating k ≥ 1 is acceptable; it follows from `f p = c` and `g p ≠ 0` that k cannot be 0.
- The requirement “g is not identically zero” is implied by `g p ≠ 0`, so the code is slightly stronger here, which is acceptable.

Final check: Are the problems the same?
- No. The core mathematical content matches except for the crucial substitution of an arbitrary predicate `IsHolomorphicOn` in place of the actual holomorphic predicate from Mathlib. Because of this, the Lean statements are not truly theorems about holomorphic functions, so the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- The logical shapes of the two theorems match the intended statements very well, but the use of a dummy predicate for holomorphicity makes the translation unfaithful. If this were replaced by Mathlib’s holomorphic predicate, it would be faithful. This corresponds to a score around 6 per the rubric.

- Conclusion: `∃ (n : ℕ) (r : ℝ) (g : ℂ → ℂ), 0 < r ∧ Metric.ball z0 r ⊆ U ∧ 0 < (n : ℕ) ∧ AnalyticOn ℂ g (Metric.ball z0 r) ∧ g z0 ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball z0 r, deriv f z = (z - z0) ^ n * g z`.
  This says there exist a positive radius r, a natural number n with n ≥ 1, and a function g that is holomorphic on the open ball B(z0,r), with g(z0) ≠ 0, such that for all z in B(z0,r), the derivative satisfies f'(z) = (z − z0)^n ⋅ g(z). Also, the ball is contained in U so everything is within the domain of analyticity.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement
The natural language statement: For holomorphic f on open U ⊂ ℂ, nonconstant, and with f'(z0) = 0, show that z0 is a zero of f' of finite order. By the standard definition, this means there exists n ≥ 1, a neighborhood of z0, and a holomorphic g with g(z0) ≠ 0 such that f'(z) = (z − z0)^n g(z) near z0. The Lean conclusion states exactly this factorization with n > 0, g analytic on a small ball, and g(z0) ≠ 0. The hypotheses (U open, f analytic on U, z0 ∈ U, f not constant on U, f'(z0) = 0) match the natural language.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Domain and holomorphy: Both state U is open and f is holomorphic on U. Lean uses AnalyticOn on U and restricts the neighborhood to a ball inside U. This matches the local nature of the claim.
- Nonconstancy: The Lean assumption `¬ ∀ z ∈ U, f z = f z0` is equivalent to “f is not constant on U”.
- Conclusion precisely encodes “f' has a zero of finite order at z0”: existence of n ≥ 1 and analytic g with g(z0) ≠ 0 and the factorization on a neighborhood.
No extraneous or missing conditions relative to the given statement. No auxiliary vacuous definitions. The statement is a faithful formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem holomorphic_on_analytic {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) : AnalyticOn ℂ f U := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any set U ⊆ ℂ and function f : ℂ → ℂ, if U is open and f is complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic), then f is analytic on U. There are no auxiliary definitions; it uses Mathlib's standard predicates: IsOpen, DifferentiableOn over ℂ, and AnalyticOn over ℂ. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: If f : U → ℂ is holomorphic on a domain U ⊆ ℂ, then f is analytic. That is, for each z₀ ∈ U, f has a Taylor series, it converges in the disk {|z − z₀| < R} where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum equals f.
- The Lean theorem directly formalizes “holomorphic implies analytic” as DifferentiableOn ℂ f U → AnalyticOn ℂ f U, which captures that f has a power series expansion around each point in U and equals its sum on some neighborhood (the usual meaning of AnalyticOn). So the parts “f has a Taylor series” and “the sum of the series is f (locally)” are encompassed by AnalyticOn.
- However, the statement in Lean does not mention or encode the additional claim about the radius of convergence being the distance to the nearest singularity. That is an extra, more precise assertion not implied by simply stating AnalyticOn.
- Also, the original assumes U is a domain (open and connected), while the Lean theorem only assumes U is open. This is a benign generalization because analyticity is local and does not require connectedness.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: Holomorphic (DifferentiableOn ℂ) implies analytic (AnalyticOn ℂ). The equality of f with its Taylor series on some neighborhood is captured implicitly by AnalyticOn.
- Differences:
  - The Lean code omits the explicit radius-of-convergence characterization “R equals the distance to the nearest singularity.”
  - The original says “domain” (open and connected), Lean assumes only “open.” This is a mild generalization and acceptable.

Conclusion: The core implication “holomorphic implies analytic” is faithfully captured. The stronger statement about the radius to the nearest singularity is missing. Hence it is almost faithful but not fully so.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem is named `lift_angle_for_simple_closed_curve`. It fixes real numbers a < b, a curve γ : ℝ → ℂ, and a function θ : ℝ → ℝ.
- Hypotheses:
  - ha : a < b.
  - hγ_nonzero: for all t in the closed interval [a, b], γ(t) ≠ 0. This encodes that γ does not go through the origin on [a, b].
  - hθ: for all t in [a, b], exp(i θ(t)) = γ(t) / |γ(t)|. This matches e^{iθ(t)} = γ(t)/|γ(t)|.
  - h_simple_closed : Prop. This is a bare proposition placeholder, commented as “γ is simple closed and piecewise smooth,” but not actually defined as such. It imposes no concrete mathematical structure relating to γ.
  - origin_inside : Prop. Another bare proposition placeholder intended to stand for “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ,” but not actually tied to γ.
- Conclusion: There exists θtil : ℝ → ℝ such that for all t in [a, b], exp(i θtil(t)) = γ(t) / |γ(t)|, and θtil(a) = θ(a), and (θtil(b) = θtil(a) + 2π ↔ origin_inside).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Positives:
  - The equation e^{iθ(t)} = γ(t)/|γ(t)| on [a,b] is represented correctly via Complex.exp (Complex.I * θ t) = γ t / Complex.abs (γ t).
  - The non-vanishing of γ on [a,b] is captured by hγ_nonzero.
  - The existence of a lift θ̃ with the same exponential constraint on [a,b], and θ̃(a) = θ(a), is expressed.
  - The endpoint condition θ̃(b) = θ̃(a) + 2π appears in an iff statement.
- Problems/Discrepancies:
  - The important geometric hypotheses “γ is simple (and implicitly simple closed to bound a region) and piecewise smooth” are not formalized. Instead, there is a placeholder hypothesis `h_simple_closed : Prop` with a comment. This is vacuous: it is not a Mathlib predicate about γ and carries no content.
  - The conclusion’s geometric predicate “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ” is replaced by an arbitrary proposition `origin_inside : Prop`, entirely unrelated to γ. The statement becomes: θ̃(b) = θ̃(a) + 2π iff origin_inside, for any Prop origin_inside, which does not capture the intended meaning.
  - The natural language assumes θ is continuous; the Lean statement does not include continuity of θ.
  - The domain is modeled as functions on ℝ with constraints only on t ∈ [a,b], which is an acceptable formalization trick, but the missing properties above are serious.
  - There is no assertion that γ is closed (γ(a) = γ(b)), which is usually needed to talk about “the region bounded by γ.” The comment mentions simple closed, but the code does not enforce it.
  - The proof is `by sorry`, but per the task we only judge the statement, not the proof.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The Lean code does not faithfully formalize the problem: it replaces key geometric hypotheses and the concluding geometric predicate with arbitrary, unrelated proposition variables. It also omits θ’s continuity. Therefore, the Lean statement is not the same as the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The placeholders `h_simple_closed : Prop` and `origin_inside : Prop` are vacuous and break the intended meaning; the continuity assumption on θ is missing; and the ‘region bounded by γ’ is not defined.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: U ⊆ ℂ is open (hU : IsOpen U). f : ℂ → ℂ is a function that is complex-differentiable on U (hfd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U). z0 ∈ U, and c ∈ ℂ with hf0 : f z0 = c, and hder0 : deriv f z0 = 0.
- Conclusion: Either (∀ z ∈ U, f z = c), i.e., f is identically equal to c on U; or there exist m ∈ ℕ with m > 0, an open set V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that g is complex-differentiable on V, g z0 ≠ 0, and for all z ∈ V we have f z = c + (z - z0)^m * g z.

This is the standard local factorization: either f is locally constant c, or f − c has a zero of some positive order m at z0 and factors as (z − z0)^m times a holomorphic, nonvanishing-at-z0 function g on a neighborhood V.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U is a domain (open and connected) and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant. If f(z0) = c and f′(z0) = 0, then either f ≡ c, or z0 is a zero of f − c of order m and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity).

Similarities:
- The Lean code captures holomorphicity (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U), the hypothesis f z0 = c and derivative zero at z0, and the dichotomy: either f ≡ c on U or there is a positive integer m and a local factorization f(z) = c + (z − z0)^m g(z) with g holomorphic and g(z0) ≠ 0. This implies z0 is a zero of f − c of order m.

Differences:
- Domain vs open: The code assumes U is open but not necessarily connected. This is a slight generalization and harmless for the local conclusion.
- Nonconstant assumption: The natural statement assumes f is nonconstant but still offers the alternative ""either f ≡ c or ..."" The Lean statement drops the nonconstant assumption and includes the constant alternative, which is a mild generalization.
- Crucial omission: The natural statement includes the additional conclusion that there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity). The Lean code does not assert this counting property. It only delivers the factorization with g(z0) ≠ 0, without ensuring g is nonvanishing on V. Thus, as stated, the code does not guarantee that in the provided V there are no other points where g(z) = 0, which would create additional solutions to f(z) = c inside V beyond z0. While one can shrink V to V ∩ {z | g z ≠ 0} (which is open and contains z0 because g is continuous) to recover the counting statement, this additional quantitative conclusion is not part of the Lean theorem.

3) Final check:
The Lean theorem is a standard and appropriate local factorization lemma from which the original counting statement follows after shrinking the neighborhood. However, the stated theorem does not include the explicit ""exactly m preimages (with multiplicity)"" conclusion. Therefore, it is not a fully faithful translation of the given natural language statement, even though it is very close and clearly on the right path.

Given these points, the translation is not faithful as stated (missing the counting conclusion), though it is almost the same and a good formalization step toward the original result.

- Conclusion: There exist sets V, W ⊆ ℂ and a function g: ℂ → ℂ such that: p ∈ V, f p ∈ W, V and W are open, f is a bijection from V onto W (`Set.BijOn f V W`), g is a two-sided inverse between V and W (g(f x) = x for x ∈ V and f(g y) = y for y ∈ W), and g is complex-differentiable on W (`DifferentiableOn ℂ g W`).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exist neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p) such that f: V → W is a bijection and f^{-1} is holomorphic.
- Lean matches most aspects: open neighborhoods V, W containing p and f(p); bijection of f from V to W; existence of inverse g that is holomorphic on W.
- A key difference: In the natural statement, f is only defined on U, so implicitly V ⊆ U is required for f: V → W to make sense. In the Lean statement, f is a global function ℂ → ℂ and there is no requirement that V ⊆ U. The hypotheses only assert differentiability of f on U, not outside U. Thus, the Lean theorem is formulated for a globally-defined function and does not ensure the local bijection is realized on a subset of U.

3) Final check (same or different problems?):
- The Lean statement is a slight generalization in the sense that f is globally defined and only required to be differentiable on U. However, it omits the constraint V ⊆ U, which is logically necessary in the original setting where f: U → ℂ. Without V ⊆ U, the conclusion “f: V → W is a bijection” might use values of f outside U, which are not part of the original function. Therefore, while very close, the Lean statement is not a perfectly faithful translation of the original theorem.

Given that everything else aligns (openness, bijection, two-sided inverse, holomorphic inverse), the mismatch is only the missing inclusion V ⊆ U (and the global-domain formulation of f). This is a near-miss rather than a vacuous or incorrect formalization.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work in ℂ with sets U, V, W ⊆ ℂ and functions f, g : ℂ → ℂ. The theorem states a local inverse result for holomorphic maps.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
  - hp : p ∈ U — the point p lies in U.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U — f is holomorphic (complex-differentiable) on U.
  - hder : fderiv ℂ f p ≠ 0 — the complex Fréchet derivative (a ℂ-linear continuous map ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ) at p is not the zero map. For holomorphic f : ℂ → ℂ, this is equivalent to the scalar complex derivative deriv ℂ f p being nonzero.
- Conclusion: There exist sets V, W ⊆ ℂ such that:
  - IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W — both V and W are open.
  - p ∈ V — the neighborhood V contains p.
  - V ⊆ U — V is contained in U.
  - f '' V = W — the image of V under f is exactly W (so W = f(V)).
  - (∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y) — f is injective on V, i.e., the restriction f|_V is injective.
  - ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, DifferentiableOn ℂ g W ∧ (∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x) ∧ (∀ y ∈ W, f (g y) = y) — there is a function g that is holomorphic on W and is a two-sided inverse between V and W: g ∘ f = id on V and f ∘ g = id on W. This precisely means (g|_W) is the holomorphic inverse of f|_V.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Given U open in ℂ, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for p ∈ U, then there exist open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, and f|_V injective with holomorphic inverse.
- The Lean statement models f as a global function f : ℂ → ℂ that is DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This is a standard formalization of “f : U → ℂ is holomorphic.” It also assumes U is open and p ∈ U, matching the hypothesis.
- The derivative non-vanishing is expressed as fderiv ℂ f p ≠ 0 (nonzero ℂ-linear map). For holomorphic f : ℂ → ℂ, this is equivalent to the usual scalar derivative f'(p) ≠ 0. Moreover, with U open and hf, p ∈ U implies differentiability at p, so the derivative is well-defined.
- The conclusions match exactly: open V, W, p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, injectivity of f|_V, and existence of a holomorphic inverse on W (given as g holomorphic on W with two-sided inverse properties). The Lean statement is even slightly stronger in specifying both inverse identities, ensuring g|_W is indeed the biholomorphic inverse.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; the theorem is stated directly with standard Mathlib notions.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically the same, with standard formalization differences (global f with DifferentiableOn on U, and fderiv ≠ 0 vs scalar derivative ≠ 0). There are no discrepancies that alter the meaning.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: “Suppose L ∈ ℂ. Show that lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere if and only if for every ε > 0 there exists an M such that |f(z)−L| < ε whenever |z| > M.”
- “In the sense of the Riemann sphere” refers to the topology at ∞ coming from the one-point compactification of ℂ. In mathlib, the filter describing ‘z → ∞’ in this sense is exactly `Filter.cocompact ℂ` on the domain. Thus `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.cocompact ℂ) (nhds L)` is the precise formalization of “lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere.”
- The right-hand side matches the epsilon–M condition using the Euclidean absolute value on ℂ. This is the standard equivalent characterization on ℝ^n (and hence ℂ ≅ ℝ^2) because complements of compact sets are eventually outside some large ball.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem states exactly the equivalence requested.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain and codomain match (f : ℂ → ℂ, L ∈ ℂ).
- The notion of “z → ∞” via the Riemann sphere is correctly captured by `Filter.cocompact ℂ`.
- The epsilon–M condition uses |z| > M (strict inequality) rather than ≥, which is a harmless and standard variation.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; there is only the theorem statement. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable under the instruction that we are only auditing the translation, not the proof.
- Hence, the formal statement is a faithful translation with no substantive discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem tendsto_at_infty_iff_forall_abs {f : ℂ → ℂ} {L : ℂ} :` Introduces a theorem for a function f: ℂ → ℂ and a complex number L.
- `Tendsto f (comap (fun z : ℂ => Complex.abs z) atTop) (nhds L) ↔` Says: f tends to L along the filter on ℂ obtained by pulling back the atTop filter on ℝ via the map z ↦ |z|. Intuitively, this means “as |z| → ∞, f(z) → L.” This matches the notion of z → ∞ in ℂ (equivalently, approaching the point at infinity in the one-point compactification/Riemann sphere) when the limit value is finite L.
- `∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z > M → dist (f z) L < ε` The standard ε–M formulation: for every ε > 0 there exists M such that whenever |z| > M, the distance from f(z) to L is less than ε. In ℂ, `dist (f z) L` equals `|f(z) - L|`.

2) Does the whole Lean statement match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: “lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M.”
- The Lean left-hand side `Tendsto f (comap abs atTop) (nhds L)` is exactly the formalization of f tending to L as |z| → ∞. In ℂ, this agrees with approaching the point at infinity in the Riemann sphere (one-point compactification) because compact sets are exactly the closed and bounded sets, so leaving every compact set is equivalent to |z| → ∞.
- The right-hand side is precisely the ε–M condition stated in the natural language, with `dist` standing for absolute value of the difference in ℂ.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code uses `dist` instead of `|·|` for the target, but in ℂ these coincide: `dist a b = |a - b|`.
- The threshold uses `|z| > M` with M any real number. This is equivalent to the usual formulation (one can always increase M to be nonnegative and strict vs non-strict inequality is immaterial here for limits).
- While the natural language mentions “in the sense of the Riemann sphere”, the Lean filter `(comap abs atTop)` captures exactly the same notion for finite limits L in ℂ.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the statement, with no vacuous placeholders and using standard Mathlib notions.

  Statement: `IsClosed (S : Set X) ↔ ∀ (u : ℕ → X) (x : X), (∀ n, u n ∈ S) → Tendsto u atTop (nhds x) → x ∈ S`.
  Natural language: S is closed if and only if for every sequence u: ℕ → X and every x ∈ X, if all terms of u lie in S and u converges to x (Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)), then x ∈ S.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement says: In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S. The Lean statement precisely matches this: it quantifies over all sequences u in S, and for any x such that u → x (converges in X), it concludes x ∈ S. The metric space assumption is present. The use of Tendsto u atTop (nhds x) is the standard formalization of convergence of sequences in X.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language speaks of sequences that converge (i.e., there exists a limit), while the Lean formulation quantifies over an arbitrary x and assumes convergence to that x; these are logically equivalent.
- The condition ""sequence in S"" is formalized as ∀ n, u n ∈ S, which is correct.
- Both directions are included via ↔.
There are no extraneous or missing hypotheses, and no auxiliary vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement with a placeholder proof, which is acceptable for translation assessment.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work in ℂ with its standard metric topology (opened via `open Set Metric`).
- Statement: Given U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U, there exists a sequence K : ℕ → Set ℂ such that:
  1) ∀ n, IsCompact (K n): each K_n is compact.
  2) ∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)): the sequence is nested inside the interiors of the next sets.
  3) U = ⋃ n, interior (K n): U is the union of the interiors of the K_n.
  4) ∀ n, ∃ m, z : Fin m → ℂ, r : Fin m → ℝ, such that K n ⊆ ⋃ i, closedBall (z i) (r i) and that union is ⊆ interior (K (n+1)): for each n there is a finite collection of closed metric balls (disks) covering K_n and contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Domain: ""Let U ⊆ ℂ be open"" matches `U : Set ℂ` and `IsOpen U`.
- Existence of a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U: The code asserts compactness of each K n. While it doesn’t explicitly state K n ⊆ U, this follows from the other conditions: since U = ⋃ n interior (K n), each interior (K n) ⊆ U, and from K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)) we deduce K n ⊆ U. Thus K_n are indeed compact subsets of U.
- Nesting: K_n ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}) matches K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}^∘.
- Covering: U = ⋃ interior(K_n) matches U = ⋃ K_n^∘ (index starting at 0 vs 1 is immaterial).
- Finite closed disks: The Lean code provides, for each n, a finite index set `Fin m` and closed metric balls `Metric.closedBall (z i) (r i)` whose union contains K n and is contained in interior (K (n+1)). In ℂ, metric closed balls are exactly closed disks. The radii are allowed to be any real numbers in the code, but to cover K n at least one must be nonnegative; allowing negative values (yielding empty balls) doesn’t change the meaning. This faithfully captures “there exists a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊆ ⋃ D_{kn} ⊆ K_{n+1}^∘.”

Final check for differences:
- The only potential implicitness is K_n ⊆ U, which is not a separate conjunct in the Lean statement but follows from the other listed properties; hence it is not a substantive discrepancy.
- Indexing from ℕ versus starting at 1 is a harmless convention difference.
- Closed disks are modeled as metric closed balls, which is standard and faithful in ℂ.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. No vacuous placeholders or misleading auxiliary definitions are present.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {U : Set Complex} {f : Complex → Complex}`: We fix an open subset U of the complex plane and a function f from ℂ to ℂ.
- The theorem `open_map_and_local_injective_of_holomorphic` assumes:
  - `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `hconn : IsConnected U`: U is connected.
  - `hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`: f is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
  - `h_nonconst : ∃ z1 z2, z1 ∈ U ∧ z2 ∈ U ∧ f z1 ≠ f z2`: f is not constant on U.
  Conclusion:
  - `IsOpen (f '' U)`: the image f(U) is open in ℂ.
  - `∀ p ∈ U, deriv f p ≠ 0 → ∃ V, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ InjOn f V`: for every p in U with nonzero complex derivative, there exists an open set V containing p on which f is injective.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypotheses match: U is open and connected; f is holomorphic on U (expressed as `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`) and nonconstant on U (existence of two points in U mapped to different values).
- The first conclusion `IsOpen (f '' U)` matches “f(U) is open.”
- The second conclusion formalizes “f is locally injective at all points where f'(p) ≠ 0.” The Lean statement gives: for each such p, there exists an open neighborhood V of p with InjOn f V. This is exactly the usual meaning of local injectivity. One small nuance: V is not required to be a subset of U, but since U is open, one can replace V by V ∩ U (still open, contains p, and preserves injectivity). Thus the Lean conclusion is slightly stronger and certainly implies the intended statement restricted to U.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same in mathematical content. The only minor difference is that the Lean version does not explicitly require the local neighborhood to be contained in U, but this is a harmless strengthening that implies the original local statement. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced, and the standard Mathlib notions are used appropriately.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  - Sequence K_n with K_n ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}): matches.
  - U = ⋃ interiors: matches (indexing from ℕ vs from 1 is an inessential shift).
  - For each n, finite collection of closed disks covering K_n and contained in interior(K_{n+1}): matches via a finite set S and unions of Metric.closedBall center radius.
- Potentially acceptable technical choices:
  - Using Metric.closedBall in ℂ for closed disks is standard; allowing arbitrary real radii (even negative) is harmless (negative radii give empty balls) and doesn't affect existence.

3) Discrepancy:
- The natural language explicitly says “a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U,” which entails K_n ⊆ U for all n. The Lean statement does not include K n ⊆ U. While U = ⋃ n interior(K n) implies interior(K n) ⊆ U for each n, it does not force K n ⊆ U. Thus, the Lean theorem allows K_n to have points outside U (as long as their interior lies in U), which is weaker than the intended statement.

Conclusion: The translation is very close but misses the requirement K_n ⊆ U. Therefore, it is not fully faithful.

In words: there is no eventually dominating nonnegative summable sequence b for |a|.
- The proof contains sorries; these do not affect the statement for our translation audit.

2) Fidelity assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent. Show that the terms a_n do not tend to zero ‘fast enough’ to ensure absolute convergence.” The comment clarifies the chosen formalization: no nonnegative summable majorant eventually dominates |a_n|.
- The theorem precisely captures this: it assumes conditional convergence (convergence of a and non-absolute convergence) and concludes that for any summable nonnegative b, there is no eventual bound |a_n| ≤ b_n. This is exactly the comparison-test formalization of “not fast enough” to force absolute convergence.
- Technical nuances:
  - Indexing starts at ℕ rather than {1,2,...}; this is immaterial for an eventual statement.
  - The hypothesis `h_conv : Summable a` is not strictly necessary to derive the conclusion, but it matches the “conditionally convergent” phrasing and does not harm fidelity.
  - No auxiliary vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content of the Lean statement and the intended natural language formalization are the same: If ∑ |a_n| diverges, then |a_n| cannot be eventually dominated by any nonnegative summable sequence, i.e., they do not decay fast enough to ensure absolute convergence. Thus, the translation is faithful.

- `Filter.Tendsto (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) (nhdsWithin z0 (Set.univ \ {z0})) Filter.atTop ↔ ...` This states that |f(z)| tends to +∞ as z approaches z0, where the approach is taken within the punctured neighborhood of z0 (i.e., z → z0 with z ≠ z0). Equivalently, this formalizes “f(z) → ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere”.
- `∀ M : ℝ, M > 0 → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z : ℂ, (0 < Complex.abs (z - z0) ∧ Complex.abs (z - z0) < δ) → Complex.abs (f z) > M` This is the epsilon–delta style formulation: for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with 0 < |z − z0| < δ, we have |f(z)| > M.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The left-hand side “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere” is captured by `Tendsto (fun z => |f z|) ... atTop`, since neighborhoods of ∞ in the Riemann sphere correspond exactly to sets {w : |w| > M}.
- The right-hand side matches the stated criterion: for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z − z0| < δ. The code uses the standard punctured condition `0 < |z − z0|`, which is the usual convention for limits and is implicitly intended in the natural language.
- Minor technical nuances (≥ vs >) are handled by using atTop and strict inequality; this is a standard equivalent formulation.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only textual difference is that the Lean code explicitly excludes z = z0 (by requiring 0 < |z−z0|), which is the standard requirement for limits and is implicitly assumed in the natural language statement. This does not change the meaning.
- Everything else aligns precisely: complex setting, Riemann sphere sense, and the quantifier structure in M and δ.

- The original says: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f: U → ℂ is holomorphic, and if p ∈ U with f'(p) ≠ 0, then for sufficiently small δ > 0, f restricted to Δ_δ(p) is injective.
- The Lean version takes f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability only assumed on U. This is a standard formalization choice and equivalent for the local statement, since we only use properties near p ∈ U.
- The conclusion in Lean is ∃ δ > 0 such that f is injective on ball p δ. This matches the intended local injectivity. The phrase “for sufficiently small δ” in math typically means “there exists δ₀ > 0 such that for all 0 < δ ≤ δ₀, ...”. Because injectivity is monotone under taking subsets, the Lean existential (∃ δ) immediately implies the universal version for all smaller radii (any smaller ball is a subset, so injectivity persists). Hence there is no quantifier mismatch in substance.
- The Lean statement does not explicitly assert ball p δ ⊆ U. However, since U is open and p ∈ U, one can choose δ small enough so that ball p δ ⊆ U; the existential allows picking such δ. Thus the Lean conclusion is effectively the same as the natural statement where f is only defined/holomorphic on U.

3) Final check – same or different?
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the code is a direct theorem statement.
- All mathematical assumptions align: U open, f holomorphic on U, nonzero derivative at p.
- The conclusion aligns with local injectivity on some open disk around p, and by monotonicity of injectivity, it matches the “sufficiently small” phrasing.
- The slight formalization difference (domain ℂ versus U) is standard and does not change the meaning of the local result.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: Let X be a type equipped with a metric space structure and assume X is complete. Let U be a sequence of subsets of X indexed by natural numbers n ∈ ℕ. Suppose each U n is open and dense. Then the intersection over all n of U n is dense in X.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: In a complete metric space (X, d), given a sequence {U_n}_{n=1}^∞ of open dense sets, show that the intersection over n = 1 to ∞ is dense.
- Lean: Uses ℕ-indexed sequence U : ℕ → Set X and asserts the intersection over all n ∈ ℕ is dense. This is the standard formalization; the only difference is the starting index (0 vs 1). This is a harmless reindexing: one can define V n = U(n+1) to match, or set U 0 = X to recover the exact statement. This constitutes a slight generalization acceptable in formalization.
- All notions (MetricSpace, CompleteSpace, IsOpen, Dense, countable intersection) are standard Mathlib notions with no placeholders.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- The mathematical content is the same: Baire category theorem for complete metric spaces asserts that a countable intersection of open dense sets is dense.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- Context: E is a real finite-dimensional normed vector space (so, up to isomorphism, ℝ^n with some norm). f : E → ℝ. s ⊆ E.
- Lemma statement: If
  • f is differentiable on s (DifferentiableOn ℝ f s),
  • the derivative fderiv ℝ f is continuous on s (ContinuousOn (fderiv ℝ f) s),
  • s is compact (IsCompact s), and
  • the operator norms of the derivatives are uniformly bounded on s, i.e., ∃ M ≥ 0 such that ∀ x ∈ s, ‖fderiv ℝ f x‖ ≤ M,
  then there exists M ≥ 0 such that f is Lipschitz on s with Lipschitz constant M (∃ M, 0 ≤ M ∧ LipschitzOnWith M f s).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Natural language: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable with continuous gradient, show that on any compact subset, if the gradient is bounded on that subset, then f is Lipschitz there.
- Domain/codomain: Lean uses a general finite-dimensional real normed space E → ℝ, which generalizes ℝ^n. This is a standard, faithful generalization.
- Differentiability and continuous gradient: Lean assumes DifferentiableOn and ContinuousOn (fderiv ℝ f), which correspond to differentiability and continuity of the derivative (gradient) on the subset s.
- Compact subset and bounded derivative: Lean assumes s is compact and that there exists a uniform bound M on the operator norm of the derivative on s. This matches “∇f is bounded on those subsets.” (It even includes the compactness assumption explicitly.)
- Conclusion: Lean concludes f is Lipschitz on s with some constant M ≥ 0, i.e., Lipschitz on the compact subset.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The Lean statement is a slight generalization (any finite-dimensional normed space instead of ℝ^n) and is stated on an arbitrary subset s rather than assuming global differentiability, but it targets exactly the compact subset s and matches the natural statement’s conditional: if the gradient (derivative) is bounded on s, then f is Lipschitz on s. It also includes the continuity of the derivative on s, consistent with the hypothesis “∇f continuous.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib concepts.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: E is a finite-dimensional normed real vector space (so, abstractly, E ≃ ℝ^n). This matches the natural-language R^n setting up to a standard generalization.
- The theorem second_order_taylor_uniform_on_compact states: For f : E → ℝ and U ⊆ E, if U is convex (hU_convex : Convex ℝ U) and f is C^2 on U (hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U), then for every compact K with K ⊆ U and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K, all y ∈ U with ∥y - x∥ < δ, we have
  | f y - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x) - (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x) (y - x) (y - x)) | ≤ ε * ∥y - x∥^2.
- Here, fderiv ℝ f x is the (Fréchet) differential at x, a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ. The term fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x is the derivative of the derivative, i.e., the second derivative at x, taking the form E →L[ℝ] (E →L[ℝ] ℝ). Applying it to (y - x) twice yields the bilinear action of the Hessian on (y - x, y - x). The factor 1/2 corresponds to the usual second-order Taylor expansion.
- The quantifiers reflect uniformity: for a given compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there exists a single δ > 0 that works simultaneously for all x ∈ K and all y ∈ U close to x.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 with Hessian continuous on a convex set U. Show that the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean statement assumes ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, which is exactly the C^2-on-U assumption (and entails continuity of derivatives up to order 2). The mention of “Hessian continuous” is consistent with ContDiffOn 2.
- The domain is generalized from ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E, which is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- Convexity of U is assumed, matching the natural language.
- The conclusion is a uniform second-order Taylor remainder estimate: for compact K ⊆ U, the remainder is bounded by ε ∥y − x∥^2 uniformly for x ∈ K and y ∈ U sufficiently close to x. This expresses the uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code allows y ∈ U near x (x ∈ K), rather than requiring y ∈ K. This is a slight generalization (stronger statement), not a weakening, and is fully compatible with the natural phrasing “uniformly on compact subsets of U.”
- The specification of the second derivative via fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x applied twice corresponds precisely to the Hessian acting on (y − x, y − x). The factor 1/2 is correct.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for a translation audit.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and slightly more general formalization of the given natural language statement. It matches all essential mathematical content and structure.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- We work in a real finite-dimensional normed space E (so this generalizes R^n). U ⊆ E is open, f : E → E is C^1 on U, p ∈ U.
- A : E ≃L[ℝ] E is a continuous linear equivalence (i.e., an invertible continuous linear map with continuous inverse). The hypothesis hder : HasFDerivAt f (A.toContinuousLinearMap) p asserts that the Fréchet derivative of f at p equals the underlying continuous linear map of A. This encodes that Df|_p is invertible.
- Conclusion: There exist open sets V, W ⊆ E and a function g : E → E such that:
  - V and W are open, p ∈ V, and V ⊆ U.
  - f '' V = W (so f maps V onto W).
  - InjOn f V (so the restriction f|_V is injective).
  - For all y ∈ W, g y ∈ V; for all y ∈ W, f (g y) = y; and for all x ∈ V, g (f x) = x. Thus g is the inverse of f|_V on W, though g is globally defined E → E.
  - g is C^1 on W: ContDiffOn ℝ 1 g W.
  - HasFDerivAt g (A.symm.toContinuousLinearMap) (f p) and fderiv ℝ g (f p) = A.symm.toContinuousLinearMap. So at the specific point y = f p, the derivative of g equals the inverse of the derivative of f at p.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Setting: The code generalizes from ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional real normed space E. This is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- Assumptions: U open, f is C^1 on U, p ∈ U, and Df|_p invertible. In the code, this is expressed by the existence of an equivalence A with HasFDerivAt f A p, which is equivalent to saying the derivative at p is invertible. This matches the intended assumption.
- Conclusions: Existence of V, W open with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, f|_V injective, and an inverse g: W → V that is C^1. The code expresses g as a global map E → E with inverse properties restricted to W and V; that matches the content.
- Derivative of the inverse: The natural language requires that for all x ∈ V, y = f(x), Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1}. The code only asserts this equality at the single point y = f p. It does not state the equality for all points in W (or for all x ∈ V). Thus the Lean statement is strictly weaker on this aspect.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Almost, but not exactly. The only substantive discrepancy is that the derivative identity for g is given only at y = f p in the code, while the natural statement requires it for all y in W (equivalently, for all x ∈ V with y = f x). Everything else (existence of local inverse, injectivity, open sets, C^1 regularity) aligns, and the generalization from ℝ^n to finite-dimensional E is acceptable.

Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful due to the missing universal quantification in the derivative identity. Everything else is accurate and standard.

The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic and injective, show that f is a conformal mapping (defined parenthetically here as a holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse) onto its image.
- The code assumes f is `Differentiable (𝕜 := ℂ)` everywhere, which corresponds to f being holomorphic/analytic on ℂ.
- Injectivity is assumed.
- The conclusion provides a function g defined on ℂ that equals the inverse on the image (g ∘ f = id) and is complex-differentiable on the image `range f`, i.e., g restricted to `range f` is holomorphic. From g ∘ f = id, it follows that for any y in range f, f (g y) = y, so g acts as a two-sided inverse on the image. Thus, we get a holomorphic inverse on the image, which is precisely what is required to say f is a holomorphic bijection onto its image with holomorphic inverse.
- The bijectivity onto the image is automatic from injectivity; the existence of g with g ∘ f = id further certifies the inverse on the image. So the Lean statement captures the intended result.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly the existence of a holomorphic inverse on the image and the inverse property g ∘ f = id, matching the parenthetical definition of conformal mapping used in the natural language statement.
- Small presentational difference: g is given as a global function ℂ → ℂ with differentiability asserted only on `range f`, rather than being defined purely as a function `range f → ℂ`. This is a standard and faithful formalization technique in Lean/Mathlib and does not alter the mathematical content.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- We work over complex numbers. The variables are:
  - f : ℂ → ℂ is a complex-valued function.
  - c : ℕ → ℂ is a sequence of complex coefficients.
  - R, A : ℝ are real constants.
- Assumptions:
  - hR: 1 < R. So we have a radius strictly larger than 1.
  - hc_bound: for all k, |c k| ≤ A / R^k. So the coefficients satisfy a geometric-type bound, as given by Cauchy estimates for a power series with radius of convergence > 1.
  - hcoeff: for all z with |z| ≤ 1, f z = ∑_{k=0}^∞ c k · z^k (tsum). So f agrees on the closed unit disk with the power series with coefficients c, centered at 0.
  - hc0: c 0 = f 0. So the constant term of the series equals the value of f at 0.
  - hf0_nonzero: f 0 ≠ 0.
- Conclusion:
  - There exists a constant C ∈ ℝ such that for all m ∈ ℕ and all z ∈ ℂ with |z| ≤ 1,
    |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (c k / c 0) z^k| ≤ C · |z|^{m+1}.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original statement:
- If f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and f(0) ≠ 0, then there exists C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and |z| ≤ 1,
  |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (f^(k)(0) / (k! f(0))) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.

Relationship:
- The code assumes an explicit power series representation of f on |z| ≤ 1 with coefficients c, and a coefficient bound |c k| ≤ A/R^k with R > 1. These are standard consequences of the hypothesis that f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk (via Taylor expansion at 0 with radius of convergence > 1 and Cauchy estimates).
- The conclusion in code uses the coefficients c rather than the Taylor coefficients f^(k)(0)/k!. However, given hcoeff (f equals its power series on a full neighborhood around 0) and uniqueness of power series expansions, c k must be the Taylor coefficients at 0, i.e., c k = f^(k)(0)/k!. Also hc0 matches c 0 = f 0. Thus the code’s conclusion matches the natural language conclusion when c is chosen to be the Taylor coefficient sequence.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences in hypotheses:
  - Natural statement: f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk.
  - Lean code: f equals a power series on |z| ≤ 1 with coefficients c that satisfy a geometric bound, and c 0 = f 0. These assumptions are a specialization/strengthening that follows from the natural hypothesis, but the code requires the user to provide c, R, A explicitly.
- Differences in formulation of the sum:
  - Natural statement uses Taylor coefficients f^(k)(0)/k! divided by f(0); the code uses c k / c 0. Under the assumptions, these coincide.
- Conclusion matches: the same type of inequality with a constant C uniform in m and z with |z| ≤ 1.

Verdict:
- This is a faithful formalization in the sense of a standard equivalent rephrasing via power series data and Cauchy bounds, though it is stated under stronger explicit hypotheses rather than the holomorphy-neighborhood hypothesis. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions, and the theorem statement captures the intended inequality.
- Slight mismatch (using explicit series and bounds instead of the holomorphic-neighborhood hypothesis and explicit derivatives) is acceptable as a standard and faithful restatement. Therefore, it passes, albeit not word-for-word identical.

- `theorem convex_compact_jordan_measurable (s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (hconv : Convex ℝ s) (hcomp : IsCompact s) : volume (frontier s) = 0 := by sorry`
Natural language: For any set s in ℝ^n (modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`), if s is convex and compact, then the Lebesgue measure (volume) of the boundary (frontier) of s is zero. The comment adds: “hence is Jordan measurable,” but this is not part of the formal statement.

2) Comparison with the original statement:
- Original: “Every bounded convex set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable.”
- Formal theorem: “Every compact convex set in ℝ^n has boundary of Lebesgue measure zero.”

Key differences:
- Hypotheses: The original assumes bounded + convex; the Lean code assumes compact + convex. In ℝ^n, compact implies bounded and closed, so the Lean hypothesis is strictly stronger (it excludes bounded, non-closed convex sets like open balls and half-open polytopes). Thus it is a specialization, not equivalent.
- Conclusion: The original asserts Jordan measurability. In ℝ^n, a set is Jordan measurable iff it is bounded and its boundary has Lebesgue measure zero. The Lean conclusion only states “boundary measure zero.” While compactness implies boundedness, the theorem does not explicitly assert “s is Jordan measurable”; it only proves a necessary condition (and, with boundedness, a sufficient one), leaving the Jordan measurability conclusion implicit in the comment, not in the formal statement.
- Scope: The original claims the result for all bounded convex sets; the Lean statement only covers compact convex sets.

3) Final check:
They are not the same. The Lean code is a stricter hypothesis (compact instead of bounded) and a slightly weaker formal conclusion (boundary measure zero, without naming Jordan measurability), even though for compact sets this would indeed imply Jordan measurability. Therefore, the translation is not faithful as stated.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the theorem uses a `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task, but the mismatch in hypothesis/conclusion remains.

- Theorem `summable.cauchy_product_of_abs_summable {F : Type*} [NormedField F] {a b : ℕ → F} (ha : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)) (hb : Summable b) : Summable (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun m => a m * b (n - m)))`:
  In words: Over a normed field F, if the series of norms ∑ ‖a n‖ converges (i.e., a is absolutely summable) and ∑ b n converges, then the sequence c_n defined by c_n = ∑_{m=0}^n a m * b (n - m) is summable. This is exactly the Cauchy product being summable (not necessarily absolutely). The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but the statement itself is clear.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show the Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely.”
- Lean theorem: assumes absolute summability of a and summability of b, concludes that the Cauchy product is summable (not absolutely summable).

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Indexing: Natural language uses n starting at 1, Lean uses 0. This is a harmless technical difference.
- Generality: Lean uses an arbitrary NormedField F; the natural statement is typically over ℝ or ℂ. This generalization is acceptable.
- Core discrepancy: The natural statement demands absolute convergence of the Cauchy product, whereas the Lean statement concludes only (plain) convergence. This is a significant difference: the natural statement is stronger (and in fact false in general); the Lean statement matches the standard correct Mertens theorem. Hence, as a translation of the given natural statement, it is not faithful.
- No auxiliary fake/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is legitimate. The issue is solely the weaker conclusion.

Conclusion: Not faithful, due to the mismatch between absolute convergence (requested) and mere convergence (stated).

- `variable {K : Type*} [NormedField K] [CompleteSpace K]`: Work over an arbitrary complete normed field K (e.g., ℝ or ℂ), ensuring series sums exist.
- `def cauchyProd (a b : ℕ → K) (n : ℕ) : K := (Finset.range (n + 1)).sum fun k => a k * b (n - k)`: Define the nth term of the Cauchy product of sequences a and b as ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}.
- The theorem `cauchy_product_of_abs_summable` states: If both series are absolutely summable (i.e., `Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)` and `Summable (fun n => ‖b n‖)`), then (i) the Cauchy product is absolutely summable, `Summable (fun n => ‖cauchyProd a b n‖)`, and (ii) its sum equals the product of the sums, `(tsum fun n => cauchyProd a b n) = (tsum a) * (tsum b)`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is absolutely convergent, and its sum equals the product of the sums.""
- The Lean theorem exactly encodes this: assumes absolute convergence of a and b, concludes absolute convergence of their Cauchy product and equality of the total sum with the product of sums.
- The definition of the Cauchy product matches the standard one.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean version works over an arbitrary complete normed field K, which is a standard and slightly more general setting than just ℝ or ℂ; this is an acceptable generalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `cauchyProd` is defined correctly. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task as we evaluate the statement/translation, not the proof.
- The use of `tsum` is appropriate and, under absolute summability, matches the intuitive sum of the series.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement, with a mild generalization to any complete normed field.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter` are just setup.
- The theorem `subseq_unique_limit_imp_seq_tendsto {x : ℕ → ℝ} {ℓ : ℝ}`: Here `x` is a real sequence and `ℓ` is a real number.
- Hypothesis `hbounded : ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ n, |x n| ≤ M` means the sequence is bounded in absolute value.
- Hypothesis `huniq : ∀ (φ : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono φ → ∀ y, Tendsto (x ∘ φ) atTop (nhds y) → y = ℓ` says: for any strictly increasing index map φ (i.e., any subsequence), and any candidate limit `y`, if the subsequence `(x ∘ φ)` converges to `y`, then necessarily `y = ℓ`. In words: every convergent subsequence has limit ℓ.
- Conclusion `Tendsto x atTop (nhds ℓ)` says the whole sequence converges to `ℓ`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If `{x_n}` is bounded and every convergent subsequence has the same limit `ℓ`, then `x_n → ℓ`.
- The Lean statement exactly reflects this, specialized to real sequences: boundedness is given by an absolute-value bound; subsequences are represented by strictly increasing maps `φ : ℕ → ℕ`; and the condition on convergent subsequences is expressed as: whenever a subsequence converges to some `y`, that `y` must equal `ℓ`.
- The conclusion is the desired convergence of the original sequence to `ℓ`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Slight specialization: the Lean version is for real sequences `ℝ`, while the natural language statement did not specify a space (but commonly means real sequences). This is a standard and acceptable specialization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` in the proof does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- A docstring states: ""Show that the partial sums s_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k do not converge uniformly on (-1,1).""
- The theorem `geom_series_not_uniform_on_Ioo` asserts: it is not the case that the sequence of functions `n ↦ (x ↦ ∑_{k in Finset.range (n+1)} x^k)` converges uniformly on the set `Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1` to the function `x ↦ 1 / (1 - x)` as `n → ∞`. In other words, the geometric partial sums do not converge uniformly on the open interval (-1,1) to their pointwise limit.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For 0 ≤ c < 1, show that the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on the closed interval [-c, c]. This is the standard local uniform convergence on compact subintervals strictly inside the radius of convergence.
- Lean theorem: Shows non-uniform convergence on the entire open interval (-1,1).

These are different statements. The natural language asks for uniform convergence on each compact subinterval [-c, c] with c < 1. The Lean code instead proves (or rather, states) that uniform convergence fails on the larger open interval (-1,1). These two facts are compatible (both can be true simultaneously), but the Lean statement does not translate the requested claim and addresses a different property on a different domain.

3) Final check:
- Original: Uniform convergence on [-c, c] for any c < 1.
- Lean: Not uniform convergence on (-1, 1).
They are not the same problem; the Lean code does not faithfully translate the original statement. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions, but the theorem statement itself is different in both quantification over c and the domain and in the assertion (uniform convergence vs failure of uniform convergence).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The theorem exists_delta_open_on_punctured takes:
  - U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U and hconn : IsConnected U (U is open and connected in ℂ),
  - f : ℂ → ℂ with hdiff : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (f is holomorphic on U),

- Natural statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and connected, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant, and p ∈ U, then ∃ δ > 0 so that f|_{Δ_δ(p) \ {p}} is an open map.
- Lean statement matches the hypotheses: U is open and connected; f is holomorphic on U; p ∈ U; nonconst is expressed as ∃ z ∈ U, f z ≠ f p, which is equivalent to nonconst on U given p ∈ U.
- Conclusion matches: existence of δ > 0 so that the restriction of f to the punctured disk is an open map. The set Metric.ball p δ is exactly Δ_δ(p).

3) Potential discrepancies and their impact:
- Domain of f: The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, rather than f : U → ℂ. This is a standard and harmless generalization in Mathlib; we only use f on U. No vacuous definitions.
- Domain in the conclusion: The map is defined on Metric.ball p δ \ {p} as a subset of ℂ, not explicitly intersected with U. Since U is open and p ∈ U, we can choose δ so that Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U, making the domain exactly the punctured disk inside U as intended. The existence quantifier allows choosing such a δ; thus this is faithful to the intended statement. Also, the subspace topology from ℂ on a subset of an open U matches the subspace topology from U.
- No auxiliary or vacuous placeholders are introduced. All notions come from Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (with the standard slight generalization of defining f on ℂ and using DifferentiableOn). It captures the same mathematical content.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `lemma compact_space_sequentially_compact {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompactSpace X] (u : ℕ → X) : ...` 
  This states: Let X be a type equipped with a metric space structure and assume X is compact (in the topological sense that every open cover has a finite subcover). Let u be a sequence in X (a function from ℕ to X). Then the following holds.
- `∃ (φ : ℕ → ℕ) (hφ : StrictMono φ) (x : X), Filter.Tendsto (u ∘ φ) Filter.atTop (nhds x)`
  There exists a function φ : ℕ → ℕ that is strictly increasing (hence defines a subsequence), and a point x ∈ X, such that the subsequence u ∘ φ converges to x, expressed via filter convergence: Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x).

Step 2: Assess if it matches the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let X be a metric space such that every open cover has a finite subcover (i.e., X is compact). Prove that every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence.
- Lean: Assumes [MetricSpace X] and [CompactSpace X], which corresponds exactly to a compact metric space. For an arbitrary sequence u, it asserts the existence of a strictly increasing φ (a subsequence) and x ∈ X such that u ∘ φ converges to x. This is precisely “every sequence has a convergent subsequence.”

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The assumption “every open cover has a finite subcover” is exactly Mathlib’s `CompactSpace X`.
- The conclusion “every sequence has a convergent subsequence” is exactly the existence of a strictly increasing index function and a limit point with filter convergence to the neighborhood filter nhds x.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `by sorry` only omits the proof, which is allowed for this translation audit.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set` are standard imports and namespace openings.
- `def RiemannIntegrableOn (f : ℝ → ℝ) (s : Set ℝ) : Prop := True`: This defines a predicate named RiemannIntegrableOn, but sets it equal to True for all functions and sets. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the real notion of Riemann integrability from mathlib.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem bounded_uniformly_continuous_on_riemann_integrable {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}
    (h_bound : ∃ M, ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc a b, |f x| ≤ M)
    (h_uc : UniformContinuousOn f (Set.Icc a b)) :
    RiemannIntegrableOn f (Set.Icc a b) := by sorry`
  In words: If f: ℝ → ℝ is bounded on the closed interval [a,b] and uniformly continuous on [a,b], then f is Riemann integrable on [a,b]. Here, boundedness is expressed as ∃ M, ∀ x ∈ [a,b], |f x| ≤ M, and uniform continuity is `UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b)`. The conclusion uses the placeholder predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` on the interval `Icc a b`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose f : [a,b] → ℝ is bounded and uniformly continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable.”
- The Lean theorem mirrors the hypotheses (boundedness and uniform continuity on [a,b]) quite well, and formalizes the domain as ℝ with properties restricted to the interval [a,b], which is a standard formalization.
- However, the key issue is that `RiemannIntegrableOn` is defined as `True`, a vacuous predicate. This makes the theorem trivial and does not capture the intended mathematical content. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions, provided the statement itself is faithful. Here the unfaithfulness stems from the placeholder predicate, not the missing proof.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean code claims a trivial truth (`True`) under the given hypotheses due to the vacuous definition, while the natural statement asserts genuine Riemann integrability. If `RiemannIntegrableOn` were replaced with mathlib’s proper Riemann integrability predicate (e.g., an existing `IsRiemannIntegrableOn` or similar), the statement would be faithful. As written, it is not.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definition renders the translation unfaithful, but if corrected, the final theorem’s structure matches the natural statement. This corresponds to a grade of 6 per the rubric.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators`: set up Mathlib and big-operator notation; no mathematical content change.
- The theorem `geom_series_not_uniform_on_Ioo` states: It is not the case that the sequence of functions `n ↦ (x ↦ ∑_{k=0}^n x^k)` converges uniformly on the set `(-1,1)` (expressed as `Set.Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1`) to the function `x ↦ 1 / (1 - x)` with respect to the filter `atTop` on `ℕ`. In symbols: ¬ TendstoUniformlyOn (s_n) (x ↦ 1/(1−x)) atTop (-1,1), where `s_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: “Show that the series ∑ x^k does not converge uniformly on (−1,1).” In standard terms, a series of functions converges uniformly on a set if its sequence of partial sums converges uniformly (to its sum function). On (−1,1), the pointwise sum is `1/(1−x)`. Thus, showing `¬ TendstoUniformlyOn s_n (1/(1−x)) …` is exactly showing the series does not converge uniformly on (−1,1).
- The code specializes to real numbers ℝ and the open interval (−1,1), matching the statement. Specifying the limit function `1/(1−x)` is appropriate and equivalent to saying the series does not converge uniformly, since any uniform limit must coincide with the pointwise limit.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem directly formalizes the claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only minor specialization is to ℝ rather than, say, ℂ, which is acceptable and faithful to a typical reading of the statement.
- The code asserts non-uniform convergence to the correct sum function; this is equivalent to the informal claim that the series does not converge uniformly on (−1,1).
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- Left-hand side means: as z approaches z0 with respect to the neighborhood filter nhds z0 (i.e., including z0), the real-valued function ‖f z‖ tends to +∞ (atTop).
- Right-hand side means: for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with ‖z - z0‖ < δ, we have M < ‖f z‖.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the Riemann sphere iff for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z-z0| < δ.
- In rigorous terms, “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the Riemann sphere” is the limit along the punctured neighborhood filter 𝓝[≠] z0, and is equivalent to ‖f z‖ → +∞ along 𝓝[≠] z0. The epsilon–delta form likewise should use 0 < ‖z - z0‖ < δ (punctured condition) rather than just ‖z - z0‖ < δ.
- The Lean code uses nhds z0 (non-punctured neighborhoods) and the inequality ‖z - z0‖ < δ (not excluding z = z0). This is strictly stronger (and actually impossible for ℝ-valued ‖f z‖ unless ‖f z0‖ is infinite, which cannot happen), and does not match the standard definition of limit at z0.
- Also, the code does not explicitly reference the Riemann sphere; that would be fine if it used the equivalent condition ‖f z‖ → +∞ along the punctured filter, but it does not.

3) Final comparison:
- The core mismatch: the filter should be 𝓝[≠] z0 (punctured neighborhoods), and the RHS should require 0 < ‖z - z0‖ < δ, not merely ‖z - z0‖ < δ. Using nhds z0 forces the condition at z = z0, making the statement false/trivialized and not the intended notion of a limit.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language theorem, despite being close in spirit.

Suggested faithful Lean shape:
  Filter.Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop ↔ ∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, 0 < ‖z - z0‖ ∧ ‖z - z0‖ < δ → M < ‖f z‖.
This would match the Riemann sphere sense and the usual epsilon–delta formulation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: n is a finite index type for matrix dimensions; R is a commutative ring. So we work with n×n matrices over a general commutative ring R.
- Definition is_permutation_matrix (P : Matrix n n R) : Prop := (∀ i j, P i j = 0 ∨ P i j = 1) ∧ (∀ i, ∑ j, P i j = 1) ∧ (∀ j, ∑ i, P i j = 1).
  Natural language: A matrix P is called a permutation matrix if (i) every entry is either 0 or 1, (ii) the sum of the entries in each row is 1, and (iii) the sum of the entries in each column is 1. The docstring explicitly states this intended meaning.
- Theorem det_permutation_matrix_is_sign: If P satisfies is_permutation_matrix, then det P = 1 or det P = -1 (both interpreted in R).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The NL statement: Let P be a permutation matrix. Prove det(P) ∈ {−1, 1}.
- Standard mathematical meaning: A permutation matrix is one obtained from a permutation σ, equivalently a 0–1 matrix with exactly one 1 in each row and exactly one 1 in each column.
- The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s standard notion of permutation matrix (via a permutation σ). Instead, it defines a predicate via: entries 0/1 and each row/column sums to 1 in the ring R.
- Key issue: Over a general commutative ring, the condition “row sum = 1” with entries restricted to 0 or 1 does not force “exactly one 1 per row.” For example, in characteristic 2, a row with three 1’s sums to 1 (since 1+1+1=1). Similarly, in characteristic p>2, any number of ones congruent to 1 mod p sums to 1. Thus, the Lean predicate strictly includes many matrices that are not permutation matrices in the usual sense. The code places no restriction on the characteristic of R, so this mismatch is real in the declared context.
- Therefore, the hypothesis in the Lean theorem is weaker than “P is a permutation matrix” (in fact, different), so the Lean statement is not a faithful translation in general. It asserts the ±1 determinant result for a broader class that, in general, is not the intended class.
- On the conclusion side, expressing “det(P) ∈ {−1,1}” as “det P = 1 ∨ det P = -1” is fine.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code’s definition of “permutation matrix” is not equivalent to the standard notion over an arbitrary commutative ring; it coincides only in settings like characteristic 0 (e.g., ℝ, ℚ, ℤ) or more generally when sums of multiple 1’s cannot equal 1 except with exactly one 1. Since the code quantifies over all CommRing R without such restriction, the translation is not faithful.
- Additional note: The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s existing permutation-matrix constructions; that by itself is fine, but it underscores the definitional mismatch. No vacuous/silly placeholders are present, but the auxiliary definition is mathematically incorrect for the generality assumed.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- import Mathlib / open Set / variable {n : ℕ}: Set up the environment and a natural number n.
- variable (mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal): Introduces an arbitrary function mstar from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as Fin n → ℝ) to extended nonnegative reals. The comment says m* is the outer measure defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles, but this is not enforced by the code; no properties of outer measures are assumed.
- theorem mstar_union_le_add (A B : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : mstar (A ∪ B) ≤ mstar A + mstar B := by sorry: States that for all sets A, B, the function mstar is subadditive on unions. No hypotheses on mstar are included; proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement is specifically about m^*, the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles, and asks to prove subadditivity for two sets. The Lean code, however, asserts subadditivity for an entirely arbitrary function mstar from sets to ENNReal, without any assumption that it is an outer measure or even that it has any property related to coverings or rectangles. Thus, the crucial structural assumption (that mstar is the specific outer measure m^*) is missing. Therefore, the code does not faithfully capture the intended statement.

Step 3: Final comparison
- Domain: Using Set (Fin n → ℝ) appropriately represents subsets of ℝ^n; this part is fine.
- Property: The theorem claims subadditivity, which matches the target property for two sets.
- Missing assumptions: The code does not specify that mstar is the outer measure defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles (nor even that it is any outer measure). This is a significant discrepancy.
- Auxiliary definitions: There are no auxiliary defs beyond mstar, but mstar is a vacuous placeholder not tied to the intended mathematical object.
Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it omits the essential assumption identifying mstar as the specific outer measure m^*.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `universe u` and `variable {X : Type u} [MetricSpace X]`: Work in an arbitrary universe with a type X equipped with a metric space structure.
- `constant RiemannIntegrableOn : (X → ℝ) → Set X → Prop`: Introduce an abstract, uninterpreted predicate meant to represent “Riemann integrable on a set” for functions from X to ℝ on subsets of X. No definition is provided, and it is not tied to any Mathlib notion.
- Theorem `continuous_on_totally_bounded_riemann_integrable {s : Set X} (f : X → ℝ) (hcont : ContinuousOn f s) (ht : TotallyBounded s) : RiemannIntegrableOn f s := by sorry`:
  This states: For any subset s of X and any function f : X → ℝ, if f is continuous on s and s is totally bounded, then f is Riemann integrable on s (in the sense of the abstract predicate). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let (X,d) be a metric space, S ⊆ X totally bounded, and f : S → ℝ continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable.
- The theorem’s hypotheses match structurally: metric space X, subset s totally bounded, f continuous on s. The only minor difference is that the Lean function has type f : X → ℝ with continuity restricted to s, rather than domain S → ℝ; this is a standard formalization and acceptable.
- The conclusion, however, uses an entirely new, uninterpreted predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` instead of a Mathlib notion of Riemann integrability. It is neither defined nor connected to any established concept in Mathlib. Thus, the statement in Lean does not genuinely assert “Riemann integrable” in any recognized sense; it merely names a property with no semantics. This violates the guideline to use applicable Mathlib terms and avoid vacuous placeholders.
- Additionally, the proof is `sorry` (we do not judge proofs here), but more importantly, the auxiliary definition is a placeholder. There is no legitimate definition of Riemann integrability on subsets of arbitrary metric spaces in Mathlib being referenced.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: Metric space context, totally bounded subset, continuity on the subset, concluding some form of “Riemann integrability on that set.”
- Different: The Lean code introduces an uninterpreted constant predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` rather than Mathlib’s Riemann integrability. Hence, the mathematical content is not faithfully captured. Also, Riemann integrability on arbitrary metric-space subsets is not a standard Mathlib concept; the code does not define it, so the statement is effectively empty of content.

Given these issues, the translation is not faithful. If `RiemannIntegrableOn` were legitimately and concretely defined to match the standard notion (and available in Mathlib), the theorem statement would align well with the natural language claim, so this is closer to a “near pass” structurally. But as written, it relies on a placeholder predicate, so it fails under the guidelines.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: a, b : ℝ; U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. f : ℂ → ℂ. α : ℝ → ℂ.
- hf_nonconst: f is nonconstant on U (∃ z, w ∈ U with f z ≠ f w).
- hα_mem: for all t ∈ [a, b], α t ∈ U (so α maps the interval into U).
- hf_hasderiv: there exists a function f' : ℂ → ℂ such that for all z ∈ U, HasDerivAt f (f' z) z (i.e., f is complex differentiable at every z ∈ U with derivative f' z).
- hα_hasderiv: there exists α' : ℝ → ℂ such that for all t ∈ [a, b], HasDerivAt α (α' t) t (α is differentiable on [a,b] with derivative α').
- hα'_ne: for all t ∈ [a, b], α'(t) ≠ 0 (using the chosen α').
- hf_avoids_zero: for all t ∈ [a, b], f (α t) ≠ 0 (so the argument of f ∘ α is defined along the interval).
- Conclusion: StrictMonoOn (t ↦ Complex.arg (f (α t))) on [a,b] ⇔ there exists θ : ℝ such that for all t ∈ [a,b], Complex.arg (f'(α t) * α'(t)) = θ (using the chosen derivatives f' and α').

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Assumptions:
  - U open: matches hU.
  - f: U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant: code has f : ℂ → ℂ but only uses derivatives on U (hf_hasderiv), and nonconst on U (hf_nonconst). This is a standard formalization of holomorphic on U.
  - α: [a,b] → U smooth, with α'(t) ≠ 0: code assumes differentiability with derivative α' on [a,b] and α'(t) ≠ 0. It does not require full smoothness (C^∞), only C¹; this is a mild generalization and acceptable.
  - The code adds hf_avoids_zero: f(α(t)) ≠ 0 ∀ t, which is a natural technical requirement so that Complex.arg(f(α t)) is defined. The natural-language statement implicitly uses an argument function, so avoiding 0 is indeed necessary; making it explicit is reasonable.
- Conclusion/LHS:
  - The statement says “f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a,b]”. The code translates this as StrictMonoOn (t ↦ Complex.arg (f (α t))) (Icc a b), i.e., the principal argument function of f ∘ α is strictly increasing on [a,b]. Potential discrepancies:
    - “Strictly monotonically” in natural language typically means either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, while StrictMonoOn specifies strictly increasing only. This is a significant potential mismatch unless the intended meaning was strictly increasing.
    - The code uses the principal branch Complex.arg, which is discontinuous across the branch cut and defined at 0 (arg 0 = 0 by convention). The natural language typically refers to an argument along the curve (often a continuous branch), but since the code also assumes f(α(t)) ≠ 0, this avoids undefinedness; still, the principal-arg choice vs a continuous branch can be a conceptual mismatch.
- Conclusion/RHS:
  - The statement says arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) is constant. The code asserts ∃ θ, ∀ t ∈ [a,b], Complex.arg (f'(α t) * α'(t)) = θ, matching this phrasing, using the derivatives provided by HasDerivAt assumptions. Note: the code allows the case f'(α t) = 0 since Complex.arg(0) is defined as 0; in classical usage arg at 0 is undefined, so the natural statement implicitly requires nonvanishing of f'(α(t)) α'(t) if one wants arg defined. The natural statement did not state this, so there is a subtle definitional difference.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Similarities:
  - U open, f holomorphic and nonconstant on U, α maps [a,b] into U, α' ≠ 0, and an equivalence between monotonicity of arg(f ∘ α) and constancy of arg(f'(α) α').
- Differences:
  1) Monotonic direction: The code requires strictly increasing (StrictMonoOn), while the natural language “strictly monotonically” likely includes strictly decreasing as well.
  2) Branch of argument: The code uses the principal argument globally; the natural statement typically refers to the argument along the curve (often a continuous determination), which is not necessarily the principal branch. This can change the truth of “strictly monotone” due to branch cuts.
  3) Definedness at zeros: The code explicitly assumes f(α(t)) ≠ 0 (good), but does not exclude zeros of f'(α(t)) α'(t); it uses Complex.arg at 0 by convention. The natural-language “arg” of the derivative product would be undefined at zeros unless explicitly handled.
  4) Smoothness vs C¹: The code assumes differentiability (C¹) rather than full smoothness; this is a harmless generalization.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the theorem is a single statement with meaningful hypotheses.

Given the nontrivial discrepancies (especially increasing-only vs monotonically-increasing-or-decreasing, and principal-arg vs continuous branch), the translation is close but not fully faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient space E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space (a generalization of R^n): `variable {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`.
- The theorem `second_order_taylor_uniform_on_compact` takes:
  - `U : Set E`, `f : E → ℝ`.
  - Hypotheses: `IsOpen U` (U is open), `Convex ℝ U` (U is convex), `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` (f is C^2 on U).
- Conclusion: For every compact set `K ⊆ U`, and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with x + h ∈ K and ‖h‖ < δ,
  we have the second-order Taylor remainder estimate:
  | f(x+h) - f(x) - (Df(x))(h) - (1/2) * (D^2 f(x))[h,h] | ≤ ε ‖h‖^2,
  where `fderiv ℝ f x` denotes the Fréchet derivative at x, and `fderiv ℝ (fun z => fderiv ℝ f z) x` is the second derivative viewed as a bilinear form by applying it to h twice.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let f: R^n → R be C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U. Show that the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean code places us in a finite-dimensional real normed space E (a standard generalization of R^n). This is acceptable.
- It assumes `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U`, which implies existence and continuity of the first and second derivatives (i.e., continuous Hessian), matching (and slightly strengthening) the hypothesis ""C^2 with H_f continuous"".
- It assumes U is convex, as in the statement, and also assumes U is open. Requiring openness is a mild extra assumption often used in analysis; this is a slight specialization that does not distort the core claim.
- The uniformity is formulated over a compact K ⊆ U: for ε>0 there is δ>0 uniform in x ∈ K with the smallness condition on h and the requirement x+h ∈ K. This is a standard way to formalize ""uniform on compact subsets"" (uniformity within the set), and is fully in line with the intended meaning. Many formulations require x, x+h ∈ K (or in U); requiring x+h ∈ K is even stronger and thus acceptable.
- The Taylor polynomial is exactly of second order with the 1/2 factor and the second derivative applied bilinearly to (h,h). The error bound is ≤ ε ‖h‖^2, as expected.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - The code generalizes from R^n to any finite-dimensional real normed space E (faithful generalization).
  - The code assumes U is open (extra but standard assumption; acceptable specialization).
  - It uses ContDiffOn 2 rather than explicitly stating ""Hessian continuous""; this implies that condition.
  - The uniformity condition requires x+h ∈ K (rather than merely x+h ∈ U), which is a standard and even stronger uniform-on-K condition.
- None of these differences undermine the mathematical content; they are standard and faithful formalizations.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful formalization of the natural language statement (with a mild standard strengthening of assumptions and a standard uniformity formulation on compact sets).

- The natural language statement: In a normed vector space X, if f: X → ℝ is differentiable at x0 and has a local minimum at x0, then Df(x0) = 0 in L(X, ℝ).
- The Lean statement uses `HasFDerivAt f f' x0` to express differentiability at x0 with derivative f' (Fréchet derivative), and `IsLocalMin f x0` for local minimum. The conclusion `f' = 0` states that the derivative as a continuous linear map is zero. This exactly matches the intended meaning of Df(x0) = 0 in L(X, ℝ).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content is the same: both require E to be a real normed vector space, f differentiable at x0, local minimum at x0, and conclude that the Fréchet derivative at x0 is zero as an element of L(E, ℝ). There are no extra assumptions or missing conditions. The translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: Suppose ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges. Show the series is conditionally convergent.
- In standard analysis, ""conditionally convergent"" means convergent but not absolutely convergent. In Mathlib, absolute convergence of a real series is `Summable (fun n => |a n|)`. Thus the theorem's hypotheses and conclusion exactly restate the problem and the definition of conditional convergence.
- The code does not introduce any auxiliary or vacuous definitions; it uses standard `Summable` and absolute value on ℝ. The conclusion is the exact conjunction of the assumptions, which is the formalization of ""conditionally convergent"" as per the docstring.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The code specializes to real sequences (ℝ), whereas the natural language could apply also to complex numbers. This is a harmless specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- The code does not define a separate predicate ""conditionally_convergent"" but directly states the equivalent conjunction; this is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_approximate_335 asserts a conjunction of three statements about the function x ↦ 1/(1 + x^2) and the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n}:
  • For all real x with |x| < 1, 1 / (1 + x^2) equals the sum (tsum) of the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n}. This identifies the power series expansion of f at 0 and states pointwise equality on the open interval (-1, 1).
  • For all real x with |x| < 1, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n} is summable. This confirms convergence within the open unit interval.
  • For all real x with |x| > 1, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n} is not summable. This establishes non-convergence outside the open unit interval.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the code uses standard Mathlib notions (tsum, Summable, absolute value). The proof is left as sorry, which is allowed for our task since we only audit the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language task: Let f(x) = 1/(x^2+1). Show that f is analytic and find a power series for f at 0 and its radius of convergence.
- The Lean statement provides the explicit power series at 0: ∑ (-1)^n x^{2n}, and proves it equals f(x) for |x| < 1. It also establishes the convergence for |x| < 1 and divergence for |x| > 1, which together imply the radius of convergence is exactly 1. Thus, the “find a power series at 0 and its radius of convergence” part is fully and precisely captured.
- Regarding “f is analytic”: the Lean statement does not explicitly claim analyticity (e.g., RealAnalytic) anywhere. However, showing that f equals a convergent power series in a neighborhood of 0 does imply analyticity at 0. The original phrasing might intend global analyticity on ℝ (which is true since 1/(1+x^2) has no real singularities), but the Lean code does not assert global analyticity; it focuses on the expansion at 0 and its convergence.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: The power series at 0 is correctly given as ∑ (-1)^n x^{2n}. The radius of convergence is correctly encoded as 1 (convergent for |x|<1, not summable for |x|>1).
- Difference: The Lean code does not explicitly assert that f is analytic (globally). It only demonstrates analyticity at 0 by giving the local power series. If the natural language statement requires a global analyticity claim, that part is missing from the Lean statement. Nonetheless, the core request about the series at 0 and its radius is faithfully captured.

Given the guidelines allowing slight specialization, this is an almost perfect translation of the key mathematical content, with only the explicit “analytic” claim missing.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The comment states the goal: if ∑ a_n is absolutely convergent, then any series obtained by grouping terms converges and has the same sum. Grouping is formalized by a strictly increasing sequence m : ℕ → ℕ with m 0 = 0, and the grouped sequence b k is the finite sum of a_i for i ∈ [m k, m (k+1)).
- noncomputable section / open Finset: standard boilerplate.
- def grouped_seq {E} [NormedAddCommGroup E] (a : ℕ → E) (m : ℕ → ℕ) (k : ℕ) : E := ∑_{i ∈ Ico (m k) (m (k+1))} a i. This defines the k-th grouped term as the sum over the contiguous block from m k up to m (k+1) − 1 (since Ico is half-open [m k, m (k+1))). This matches the intended notion of grouping contiguous terms while preserving order.
- theorem grouped_series_of_absolutely_summable: Given a normed additive group E, a sequence a : ℕ → E with Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖) (absolute convergence), and a strictly monotone m with m 0 = 0, then the grouped sequence (grouped_seq a m) is Summable and its sum equals the sum of a: tsum (grouped_seq a m) = tsum a. This states that the grouped series converges and has the same sum as the original series.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Absolute convergence is formalized as Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖), which is the standard mathlib notion.
- ""Any series obtained by grouping terms"" is formalized by taking any strictly increasing m : ℕ → ℕ with m 0 = 0 and defining each group as a contiguous block [m k, m (k+1)). StrictMono ensures blocks are nonempty and disjoint; m 0 = 0 ensures the union of blocks covers all n ≥ 0, i.e., all indices since ℕ starts at 0 here. This exactly captures grouping in order into consecutive finite blocks.
- The conclusion matches: the grouped series is summable and has the same sum as the original, expressed as Summable (grouped_seq a m) and tsum (grouped_seq a m) = tsum a.
- The index in the natural language starts at 1; the code uses ℕ starting at 0 with m 0 = 0. This is a harmless reindexing and does not change the mathematical content.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: grouped_seq is a genuine definition; standard mathlib terms are used (Summable, tsum, StrictMono, Finset.Ico). The proof is omitted (by sorry), but per the auditing guidelines we assess the statement, not the proof.
- The code does not require extra unintended hypotheses nor miss essential ones. It generalizes to any NormedAddCommGroup E, consistent with the statement about absolute convergence.
- Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim about grouping absolutely convergent series.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient space E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space (so it generalizes R^n). f : E → ℝ is a real-valued function.
- Hypotheses: U ⊆ E is convex (hU : Convex ℝ U). The function f is C^2 on the set U in the sense of Frechet calculus on sets (hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U).
- The theorem claims: For every compact K ⊆ U and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x, y ∈ K with ‖y − x‖ < δ, the second-order Taylor remainder at x, evaluated at y, is bounded by ε‖y − x‖^2, where the second-order Taylor polynomial used is f x + f′(x)(y − x) + (1/2) f″(x)(y − x, y − x). In Lean's notation this is written using fderiv (the full Frechet derivative) and fderiv of fderiv for the second derivative: | f y − f x − fderiv ℝ f x (y − x) − (1/2) * (fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ f) x (y − x) (y − x)) | ≤ ε * ‖y − x‖^2. The quantifiers are uniform in x, y ∈ K.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2 and the Hessian H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- Generalization: The Lean code works in any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E (acceptable slight generalization).
- Regularity: Natural language says f is C^2 (globally), and the Hessian is continuous on U; Lean assumes ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, i.e., f is C^2 on U as a set (a slightly weaker assumption than global C^2; acceptable as a generalization).
- Uniformity on compact subsets: The Lean statement gives an ε-δ formulation uniform over K ⊆ U, which matches the intended meaning of uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets. It restricts y to lie in K as well (x, y ∈ K), which is a slightly stronger restriction than the most common formulation (usually x ∈ K and y sufficiently close to x with y ∈ U). This is a benign specialization and acceptable.
- Convexity: Both mention convex U. In Lean, convexity ensures the segment between x and y lies in U, which is standard for Taylor along segments.

3) Critical mismatch:
- The key technical issue is that the Lean statement uses the unrestricted derivatives fderiv ℝ f x and fderiv ℝ (fderiv ℝ f) x, but its hypothesis only assumes ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (regularity on the set U). For functions only known to be C^2 on a set U (not necessarily open), one generally must use the within-set derivatives (fderivWithin) in the Taylor formula, unless one additionally assumes global differentiability at x. In particular, ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U does not imply DifferentiableAt ℝ f x for x ∈ U (e.g., boundary points), so the use of fderiv (unrestricted derivative) may be illegitimate at such points. Mathlib defines fderiv at non-differentiable points in a default way, so the expression compiles, but it does not reflect the intended mathematical content under these hypotheses.
- In contrast, the natural statement assumes f is globally C^2 on ℝ^n, which does guarantee DifferentiableAt everywhere, and then the use of fderiv would be legitimate. Therefore, the Lean code both weakens the hypotheses (only ContDiffOn on U) and then uses an unrestricted derivative that the weakened hypotheses do not justify. This is a substantive mismatch in the formalization.

4) Other minor differences:
- Requiring y ∈ K is a slight specialization; acceptable.
- The second derivative is expressed as fderiv of fderiv, which correctly represents the Hessian as a bilinear form in this setting.

Conclusion: Although the overall shape and intent match the natural statement, the crucial misuse of unrestricted derivatives under only ContDiffOn-on-U hypotheses means the formal statement is not a faithful translation. To be faithful, either require f to be ContDiff ℝ 2 on all of E, or replace fderiv by fderivWithin (and the second derivative accordingly) in the statement.

- `def c (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ := Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)`: Defines the Cauchy product term-by-term: for sequences a, b : ℕ → ℝ, the nth term c n is the finite sum over k = 0..n of a k times b (n − k). This matches c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}.
- The theorem `cauchy_product_of_absolute_and_convergent {a b : ℕ → ℝ} (ha : Summable fun n => |a n|) (hb : Summable b) : Summable (c a b) ∧ (tsum (c a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b))` states: If the series of a is absolutely summable (summable of |a n|) and the series of b is summable, then the series of the Cauchy product c is summable and its sum equals the product of the sums of a and b. This is precisely the standard Cauchy product theorem under absolute convergence of one factor.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges. Show that c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} defines a convergent series with sum equal to the product of sums.
- Lean statement: Exactly assumes absolute summability of a and summability of b, defines c_n as the Cauchy product term, concludes that ∑ c_n converges and that tsum c equals tsum a times tsum b. This is a direct formalization.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The only mild specialization is that the Lean code works over ℝ; the natural language did not specify the scalar field. This is an acceptable specialization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used: c is properly defined, and the theorem hypotheses and conclusion match the intended meaning. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is allowed per the task; we only judge the statement.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- def rectangle (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := {x | ∀ i, a i ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ b i}:
  Defines a subset of ℝ^n (represented as functions Fin n → ℝ) consisting of all points x whose coordinates lie between a and b coordinatewise, inclusive. This is the axis-aligned closed rectangle [a, b]. Note: there is no assumption that a i ≤ b i for all i; if some a i > b i, the set is empty.
- def volume (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin n)).prod fun i => (b i - a i):
  Defines the ""volume"" as the product of differences b i − a i over all coordinates. This can be negative if a i > b i for an odd number of coordinates; no max(0, ·) is taken, and no assumption a ≤ b is imposed. So this does not match the usual nonnegative volume of a rectangle unless one adds the constraint a ≤ b.
- theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_multivar_int_1938 (mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) : ∀ (a b : Fin n → ℝ), mstar (rectangle a b) = volume a b := by ... sorry:
  States that for any function mstar from sets (in ℝ^n) to real numbers, and for all a, b, we have mstar(rectangle a b) = volume a b. There are no assumptions that mstar is an outer measure, or that it is defined via countable coverings by open rectangles, or any properties at all. The proof is omitted.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Let m* denote the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles. If R is a closed rectangle, then m*(R) = V(R) (the volume of R).
- Discrepancies:
  1) mstar is completely unconstrained in the Lean theorem; it is not defined to be the outer measure, nor even an outer measure. The theorem quantifies over arbitrary mstar and asserts equality for all mstar, which is far stronger and false in general. This is a major mismatch.
  2) The codomain of mstar is ℝ, whereas outer measures in Mathlib are usually ℝ≥0∞-valued. While one could work with ℝ-valued nonnegative set functions, here no nonnegativity or outer measure structure is assumed, so the mismatch is significant.
  3) The rectangle definition does not enforce a ≤ b coordinatewise. For such a and b with a_i > b_i, the set rectangle a b is empty but the defined volume can be negative or nonzero, leading to mstar(∅) = product(b_i − a_i), which contradicts standard outer measure properties (m*(∅) = 0). This is inconsistent with the intended statement.
  4) The volume definition should produce a nonnegative value equal to the product of side lengths; typically one either assumes a ≤ b coordinatewise or takes max(0, b_i − a_i). The current definition does neither.
  5) The statement refers to m* defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles; the Lean code does not formalize this at all, nor does it import or use Mathlib’s measure/outer measure machinery.

Final check:
- The math problems are different. The Lean statement claims a universal property for an arbitrary function mstar with no structure and uses a potentially negative ""volume"" definition, whereas the natural language statement is about a specific outer measure and the standard nonnegative volume of closed rectangles. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade justification:
- Although the definitions of rectangle and a form of volume are present, the central object (outer measure m*) is completely missing/replaced by an arbitrary function, and the volume is incorrectly specified without ensuring nonnegativity. These are substantial deviations. Hence a low grade is appropriate.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variables {𝕜 : Type _} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜]`: We are working over a nontrivially normed field 𝕜.
- `variables {E : Type _} [SeminormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E]`: E is a seminormed additive commutative group with a 𝕜-vector space structure compatible with the seminorm (i.e., a seminormed vector space over 𝕜).
- `variables {F : Type _} [SeminormedAddCommGroup F] [NormedSpace 𝕜 F]`: Similarly, F is a seminormed vector space over 𝕜.
- The theorem: `theorem bounded_linear_map_is_continuous {f : E → F} (hf : IsBoundedLinearMap 𝕜 f) : Continuous f := by sorry` states: if f : E → F is a bounded linear map (captured by the predicate `IsBoundedLinearMap 𝕜 f`, which encodes both linearity and the existence of a global bound of the form ‖f x‖ ≤ C‖x‖), then f is continuous.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: In normed vector spaces X and Y, if A is linear and bounded, then A is continuous. This is exactly what `IsBoundedLinearMap 𝕜 f` captures (linearity plus a uniform bound of operator type), and `Continuous f` is the intended conclusion. The Lean code uses seminormed spaces, which is a slight generalization of normed spaces, but this is acceptable and faithful to the spirit of the statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Generality: Lean uses seminormed spaces rather than normed spaces, a harmless generalization permitted by the guidelines.
- Boundedness notion: `IsBoundedLinearMap` uses the standard operator bound (exists C with ‖f x‖ ≤ C‖x‖). This matches the usual meaning of “bounded linear” in normed space theory. If one interprets “bounded” as mapping bounded sets to bounded sets, these are equivalent for linear maps in normed spaces, so no mismatch.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is direct and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the given natural language statement (slightly more general), with no cheating.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem sequentially_compact_metric_space_compact {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] ... : CompactSpace X` states: For any type X equipped with a metric space structure, under the hypothesis `h_seq`, the space X is compact (i.e., the entire space is compact, equivalently every open cover has a finite subcover).
- The hypothesis `h_seq : ∀ s : ℕ → X, ∃ (φ : ℕ → ℕ) (hφ : StrictMono φ) (x : X), Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)` means: For every sequence `s` in X, there exists a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` (a subsequence selector) and a point `x : X` such that the subsequence `s ∘ φ` converges to `x` (formalized as `Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)`). This is exactly “every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence (converging to a point of X)”.
- Conclusion `CompactSpace X` is the standard Mathlib class stating that X is compact; for the whole space, this is equivalent to “every open cover of X has a finite subcover”.
- No auxiliary fake or vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for the purpose of translation fidelity.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let X be a metric space such that every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence. Prove that every open cover of X has a finite subcover.”
- Lean: assumes X is a metric space, and assumes every sequence has a convergent subsequence (via existence of a strictly increasing subsequence and a limit point in X), and concludes `CompactSpace X`, which is equivalent to every open cover having a finite subcover.
- This matches exactly the intended meaning (sequential compactness implies compactness in metric spaces).

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean hypothesis explicitly specifies the subsequence via a strictly monotone index map `φ` and uses filter-based convergence; this is a standard formalization of subsequence convergence and does not change the meaning.
- The conclusion as `CompactSpace X` is precisely the topological compactness of X (every open cover has a finite subcover).
- No discrepancies or unwanted generalizations/specializations.

Therefore, the code is a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem states: Let f : ℂ → ℂ and z0 : ℂ. Assume h : AnalyticAt ℂ f z0 (f is analytic at z0) and h' : deriv f z0 ≠ 0 (the complex derivative at z0 is nonzero). Then there exist open sets U, V ⊆ ℂ and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that:
  • U and V are open.
  • z0 ∈ U and f z0 ∈ V.
  • f '' U = V (the image of U under f equals V).
  • For all z ∈ U, g (f z) = z (g is a left inverse of f on U).
  • For all w ∈ V, f (g w) = w (g is a right inverse of f on V).
  • AnalyticAt ℂ g (f z0) (g is analytic at the point f z0).
This expresses that f restricts to a bijection U → V with inverse g, and that g is analytic at f z0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic and f'(z0) ≠ 0, then f is a local diffeomorphism at z0, i.e., locally invertible with analytic inverse.
- Assumptions: The Lean code assumes f is analytic at z0 (AnalyticAt ℂ f z0), which is a slight weakening compared to “f is analytic on ℂ.” This is a benign generalization; the local inverse theorem only needs analyticity near z0.
- Conclusion: The key content of “local diffeomorphism at z0” (or local biholomorphism) is that there exist neighborhoods U of z0 and V of f(z0) such that f|U : U → V is a bijection and the inverse g : V → U is analytic on a neighborhood of f(z0) (indeed on V, typically). The Lean statement provides the local bijection data (f '' U = V and the two-sided inverse equalities on U and V), which is correct. However, for the analyticity of the inverse, it only asserts AnalyticAt ℂ g (f z0), i.e., analyticity of g at the single point f z0, not on an open neighborhood like V.

3) Final comparison:
- Similarities: Both assert local invertibility with a genuine inverse between open sets containing z0 and f z0. The derivative condition is correctly translated (deriv f z0 ≠ 0). The inverse identities on U and V match a local bijection.
- Differences:
  • Assumption: Lean uses AnalyticAt at z0 rather than f analytic on ℂ. This is a slight generalization and acceptable.
  • Conclusion (analyticity of the inverse): The natural language “with analytic inverse” standardly means the inverse is analytic on a neighborhood (typically on V). The Lean code only claims AnalyticAt g at the single point f z0. While AnalyticAt implies analyticity on some neighborhood of f z0, the statement does not guarantee that neighborhood coincides with the V in which the inverse identities hold. Thus the Lean conclusion is strictly weaker than the usual formulation of a local diffeomorphism with analytic inverse on V.
Given this mismatch, the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- The theorem `entire_nonzero_has_log` takes `f : ℂ → ℂ` with hypotheses `(hf : Differentiable ℂ f)` and `(h_nonzero : ∀ z : ℂ, f z ≠ 0)`. In Mathlib, `Differentiable ℂ f` means complex Fréchet differentiable at every point of ℂ, i.e., entire/holomorphic.
- The conclusion is `∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ g ∧ ∀ z, Complex.exp (g z) = f z`. This asserts the existence of a global holomorphic `g` such that `exp ∘ g = f` (the pointwise equality `∀ z, exp(g z) = f z` is equivalent to the functional equality).
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but we only evaluate the statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let f: ℂ → ℂ be analytic (entire) and never zero. Show there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.
- Lean: Assumes `f` is `Differentiable ℂ` everywhere (entire) and nonvanishing, and concludes existence of a `Differentiable ℂ g` with `Complex.exp ∘ g = f`.
- The notions align: in Mathlib, `Differentiable ℂ` on all of ℂ corresponds to entire/holomorphic; the conclusion expresses exactly that f is an exponential of an entire function.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain and codomain are ℂ in both.
- ""analytic""/""holomorphic"" are represented by `Differentiable ℂ` correctly.
- Nonvanishing hypothesis matches `∀ z, f z ≠ 0`.
- Conclusion uses `∀ z, exp(g z) = f z`, equivalent to `f = exp ∘ g`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib.
- No extra or missing conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language assertion.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := Real.exp x * Real.cos x`
  This defines the real function f(x) = e^x cos x, exactly matching the problem's function.

- `noncomputable def a (n : ℕ) : ℝ := (Complex.re ((1 + Complex.I) ^ n)) / (Nat.factorial n : ℝ)`
  This defines coefficients a_n = Re((1 + i)^n) / n!, which indeed are the intended power series coefficients if we express f as the real part of exp((1+i)x) and expand exp as its power series.

- `theorem analytic_f : AnalyticAt ℝ f 0 := by sorry`
  This claims f is real-analytic at 0 (no proof provided). It does not assert global analyticity on ℝ, only at the point 0.

- `theorem taylor_exp_cos : ∀ x : ℝ, f x = ∑' (n : ℕ), a n * x ^ n := by sorry`
  This states, for all real x, f(x) equals the (real) series sum over n of a_n x^n. This is stronger than just a local expansion at 0; it asserts convergence and equality for all x, i.e., an entire power series with infinite radius. The coefficients match a_n = Re((1+i)^n)/n!.

- `theorem radius_infinite : True := by trivial`
  This is a vacuous statement. It does not formalize the radius of convergence being infinite; it merely proves True. The comment suggests the intended statement, but the theorem does not state it.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The problem asks to prove f is analytic and to find a power series for f at 0 and its radius of convergence.
- The code defines f correctly and gives a precise candidate series with coefficients a_n = Re((1+i)^n)/n!.
- It asserts analyticity at 0 (AnalyticAt ℝ f 0), which is a weaker claim than global analyticity. The problem phrasing ""f is analytic"" is typically understood as real-analytic on ℝ (or at least near 0, but combined with the request for the radius, one expects a global conclusion). However, the next theorem asserts equality f(x) = sum_n a_n x^n for all x, which would imply infinite radius and analyticity everywhere; so while the AnalyticAt theorem is weak, the series equality theorem is strong enough to cover the intended conclusion. Still, the code does not explicitly state ""infinite radius"" in a formal way.
- Crucially, the radius of convergence is not stated at all: `radius_infinite : True` is vacuous and does not encode the intended mathematical statement. This fails the requirement to state the radius of convergence.

Final check:
- The power series itself is correctly specified and the universal equality theorem is an acceptable (even stronger) formalization of ""find a power series at 0"".
- The analyticity is only asserted at 0 (but implicitly overcome by the global series equality), yet the separate theorem for radius is missing/incorrect (vacuous True). Therefore, the translation is not faithful because a key part of the natural language request—the radius of convergence—is not properly formalized.

Grade rationale:
- Substantial parts are correct (function and coefficients; a strong series identity). However, the radius-of-convergence statement is not formalized (vacuous), and the analyticity claim is only at 0 in its dedicated theorem. Per the guidelines, a vacuous placeholder for an essential part causes failure. If the radius theorem were fixed to state infinite radius, the translation would be essentially faithful. Hence a mid-level score.

  sorry
",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_12552 takes as inputs:
  - f : ℂ → ℂ (a complex-valued function on ℂ),
  - p : FormalMultilinearSeries ℂ ℂ ℂ (a formal power series in the Mathlib sense, with coefficients given by continuous multilinear maps),
  - hp : HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0 (f admits the formal power series p at 0, i.e., f is analytic at 0 with p its power series),
  - h0 : p.coeff 0 ≠ 0 (the constant term of the power series is nonzero; in one complex variable this corresponds to f(0) ≠ 0).
- Conclusion: There exists a real constant C such that for all m : ℕ and all z : ℂ with ‖z‖ ≤ 1,
  ‖1 - ∑_{k=0}^{m} (p.coeff k)/(p.coeff 0) * z^k‖ ≤ C * ‖z‖^{m+1}.
  Interpreting p.coeff k in one complex variable, these coefficients correspond to f^{(k)}(0)/k! (up to the standard identification in Mathlib between the multilinear coefficient and the scalar coefficient in one variable). Thus the sum is the truncation of the Taylor series of f(z)/f(0) at 0, and the inequality is a uniform bound of the tail by a constant times |z|^{m+1}, valid for all |z| ≤ 1.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language hypothesis: f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk \overline{D}(0,1) and f(0) ≠ 0. This ensures analyticity at 0 and a radius of convergence strictly larger than 1 (in particular, control on the whole closed unit disk), which is crucial for deriving a uniform bound for all |z| ≤ 1.
- Lean hypothesis: HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0, i.e., f is analytic at 0 with some (unspecified) positive radius of convergence, but no condition that the radius is ≥ 1 or that f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk. This is significantly weaker and does not guarantee the claimed bound for all z with ‖z‖ ≤ 1.
- Coefficients: The natural language uses f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0)); Lean uses (p.coeff k)/(p.coeff 0). Under the standard 1D identification, p.coeff k corresponds to f^{(k)}(0)/k!, and p.coeff 0 corresponds to f(0). So this part matches conceptually.
- Conclusion: Both assert existence of a constant C (independent of m and z) such that the tail is bounded by C |z|^{m+1} for |z| ≤ 1. The Lean version allows C ∈ ℝ without stating C ≥ 0; this is a harmless technical omission since one can replace C by max(C, 0).

3) Final check: same or different?
- The main discrepancy is the domain of holomorphy: the natural language requires f to be holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk, while the Lean code only assumes analyticity at 0 with no control on the radius of convergence relative to 1. The Lean statement therefore claims a stronger (and generally false) uniform bound on the whole unit disk without the necessary hypothesis.
- Aside from this, the normalization by f(0) and the form of the inequality match the intended statement, and the use of HasFPowerSeriesAt/p.coeff is a reasonable Mathlib formalization of Taylor coefficients. However, the missing hypothesis about analyticity on (at least) the unit disk makes the translation not faithful.

Therefore, the translation does not faithfully capture the original hypothesis; it's a significant mismatch, not a mere slight generalization or specialization.

- `theorem D_linear (p q : Polynomial Real) (a b : Real) : Polynomial.derivative (a • p + b • q) = a • Polynomial.derivative p + b • Polynomial.derivative q := by sorry`
  This states: for all polynomials p, q over ℝ and reals a, b, the derivative of the linear combination a•p + b•q equals the same linear combination of derivatives a•derivative p + b•derivative q. This is the standard linearity property of the derivative operator D on ℝ[t].

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The statement precisely captures that D: ℝ[t] → ℝ[t] is ℝ-linear, since D(a p + b q) = a D p + b D q for all a, b, p, q is equivalent to linearity (additivity and homogeneity). The code uses the correct Mathlib notion `Polynomial.derivative` and the ℝ-module structure on `Polynomial Real`. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
The formal statement and the natural language problem are the same: demonstrating that the derivative operator is linear. The Lean theorem directly encodes the required linearity identity. There are no discrepancies, generalizations, or specializations beyond the intended claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: bring in Mathlib and set notation; no mathematical content change.
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: we work in ℝ^n with n a natural number.
- The theorem `max_interior_has_zero_deriv`:
  - Domain and codomain: `{K : Set (Fin n → ℝ)}` means K ⊆ ℝ^n (with ℝ^n represented as `Fin n → ℝ`), `{f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ}` is a function f: ℝ^n → ℝ, and `{x0 : Fin n → ℝ}` is the point x0 ∈ ℝ^n.
  - Hypotheses:
    - `(hK : IsCompact K)`: K is compact.
    - `(hcont : ContinuousOn f K)`: f is continuous on K (as a set).
    - `(hdiff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K))`: f is (Fréchet) differentiable on the interior of K.
    - `(hx : x0 ∈ interior K)`: x0 lies in the interior of K (hence x0 ∈ K as well).
    - `(hmax : ∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x0)`: f attains a maximum on K at x0; i.e., for all x ∈ K, f(x) ≤ f(x0).
  - Conclusion: `fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0`: the Fréchet derivative of f at x0 is the zero continuous linear map (i.e., Df(x0) = 0).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The ambient spaces match: ℝ^n → ℝ, with ℝ^n encoded as `Fin n → ℝ`.
- Continuity on K and compactness of K are exactly stated by `ContinuousOn f K` and `IsCompact K`.
- Differentiability on the interior of K is exactly `DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K)`.
- The condition that f attains a maximum at a point in the interior is captured by `hx : x0 ∈ interior K` together with `hmax : ∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x0`.
- The conclusion that the derivative at x0 vanishes is encoded as `fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0`, which is the standard formalization of Df(x0) = 0.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem precisely states the same mathematical content as the natural language statement, with no extra or missing assumptions. The use of interior ensures differentiability at x0 via `hdiff` and `hx`. There are no auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement (the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation fidelity). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- theorem absolute_summable_rearrangement {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [CompleteSpace E] (a : ℕ → E) (p : Equiv.Perm ℕ) (h : Summable (λ n => ‖a n‖)) : Summable (a ∘ p) ∧ tsum (a ∘ p) = tsum a := by sorry
  Natural language: Let E be a complete normed additive commutative group. Let a be a sequence in E and p a permutation of ℕ. If the series of norms ∑ ‖a n‖ is summable (absolute convergence), then the rearranged series a ∘ p is summable and its sum equals the sum of the original series.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- Original: Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show that for any rearrangement, the sum remains the same.
- Lean: Exactly that, in a slightly more general setting (any complete normed additive commutative group E, not just ℝ or ℂ). The hypothesis h: Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖) is absolute convergence; conclusion gives Summable (a ∘ p) and tsum (a ∘ p) = tsum a for any permutation p.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Same mathematical content, with a standard and acceptable generalization from scalars to complete normed additive groups. No vacuous or auxiliary definitions; no placeholders beyond the proof itself. Quantification over any rearrangement is via arbitrary p : Equiv.Perm ℕ.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

However, the actual theorem is a trivial identity 1 = 1, completely unrelated to f or radii of convergence. This is a vacuous assertion and does not formalize the intended claim.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to show f is analytic (presumably at 0, in context of finding a power series at 0) and to find the power series and its radius of convergence.
- The code defines f over ℂ and asserts analyticity at 0 (reasonable and faithful to the intended local analyticity), provides the correct power series identity on |z| < 1 (faithful), but fails to state the radius-of-convergence result: instead it provides a tautology 1=1.

Final check:
- Are the two problems the same? Partially. The code faithfully captures the definition of f, analyticity at 0, and the power series expansion on its disk of convergence. It does not faithfully express the radius of convergence; the last theorem is unrelated to the intended claim. Also, the original statement uses real x, but the complex generalization is a standard, acceptable strengthening.
- Therefore, because the radius-of-convergence part is missing/incorrectly formalized (vacuous), the translation is not fully faithful.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- variables {n : ℕ}: We fix a natural number n.
- def is_closed_rectangle (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True: Introduces a predicate meaning “R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n,” but it is defined as True for all R (vacuous placeholder).
- def RiemannIntegrableOn {α : Type _} (R : Set α) (f : α → ℝ) : Prop := True: Introduces a predicate meaning “f is Riemann integrable on R,” but it is defined as True for all f and R (vacuous placeholder).
- theorem max_min_riemann_integrable ... (h_rect : is_closed_rectangle R) (hf : RiemannIntegrableOn R f) (hg : RiemannIntegrableOn R g) : RiemannIntegrableOn R (fun x => max (f x) (g x)) ∧ RiemannIntegrableOn R (fun x => min (f x) (g x)) := by sorry: States that if R is a closed rectangle and f,g are Riemann integrable on R, then max(f,g) and min(f,g) are Riemann integrable on R. However, since both predicates are defined as True, the hypotheses and conclusion are all trivially true. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The intended mathematical content matches the natural language statement: on a closed rectangle R in ℝ^n, if f and g are Riemann integrable, then max(f,g) and min(f,g) are Riemann integrable. The function space (Fin n → ℝ) models ℝ^n appropriately, and the use of max/min on real-valued functions is correct.

However, the code uses vacuous placeholder predicates `is_closed_rectangle` and `RiemannIntegrableOn`, both defined as True. This makes the statement trivial and does not faithfully capture the intended mathematical notions. According to the guidelines, such vacuous auxiliary definitions cause the translation to fail.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Natural language problem: A substantive statement about Riemann integrability on closed rectangles in ℝ^n.
- Lean statement: Formally resembles the same, but the key predicates are vacuous placeholders, so the meaning is not preserved. Additionally, the lemma is left unproven with `sorry` (allowed for compilation, but still indicates non-substantive content).

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation due to vacuous definitions. If those placeholders were replaced with real Mathlib predicates (e.g., a proper closed box predicate and a genuine Riemann integrability predicate) the theorem statement would be faithful. As is, it fails the criteria.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The lemma is parameterized by a natural number n.
- It takes m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal, i.e., an arbitrary function from subsets of ℝ^n (formalized as Fin n → ℝ) to extended nonnegative reals. There is no assumption that m_star is an outer measure.
- It takes R : Fin n → Set (Fin n → ℝ), a family of n subsets of ℝ^n indexed by Fin n.
- Hypothesis h_rect: for each i, R i is open and there exist functions a, b : Fin n → ℝ such that R i = { x | ∀ j, a j < x j ∧ x j < b j }. This encodes that R i is an open rectangle (open box) in ℝ^n.
- Hypothesis h_disj: the family is pairwise disjoint: for all i ≠ j, Disjoint (R i) (R j).
- Goal: m_star (⋃ i, R i) = ∑ i, m_star (R i). Here the union and sum range over the finite type Fin n (so there are exactly n rectangles).
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for this auditing task as we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let m* be the (Lebesgue) outer measure on ℝ^n. Suppose R_1,...,R_n are pairwise disjoint open rectangles. Prove m*(⋃_{k=1}^n R_k) = ∑_{k=1}^n m*(R_k).
- The code captures: n rectangles in ℝ^n, each an open rectangle and pairwise disjoint, and claims additivity of m_star over their union.
- Critical discrepancy: In the math statement, m* is the specific outer measure (commonly the Lebesgue outer measure) on ℝ^n. In the code, m_star is just an arbitrary function Set (ℝ^n) → ENNReal with no properties ensuring it is an outer measure at all, let alone the Lebesgue outer measure. This is a major mismatch, since the conclusion would be false for a general function and even for a general outer measure (without measurability assumptions). The intended m* has crucial structure (outer measure properties and being the Lebesgue one) that justifies the additivity on disjoint open rectangles.
- Indexing and domain are otherwise aligned: ℝ^n is modeled as Fin n → ℝ; there are exactly n rectangles (indexed by Fin n), disjointness is correctly formalized, and the definition of open rectangle matches the usual product-of-open-intervals notion.
- Minor note: The code allows degenerate choices of a, b resulting in empty sets, but that does not affect the correctness of the intended statement (empty rectangles are harmless). Also, the original problem uses the same symbol n for both dimension and number of rectangles; the code follows that. While unusual, it is consistent with the given wording.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The key mathematical content (that m* is the Lebesgue outer measure on ℝ^n, or at least an outer measure with the appropriate properties) is missing. The code’s m_star is an arbitrary function, making the statement not faithful. If m_star were typed as an OuterMeasure (Fin n → ℝ) and/or specialized to the Lebesgue outer measure, the formalization would be on track. As it stands, the translation is not faithful to the original statement.

Grade rationale: The statement shape (finite disjoint union of open rectangles in ℝ^n equals sum) and indexing are correct, but the crucial assumption that m_star is (the Lebesgue) outer measure is missing. No fake/vacuous definitions were introduced, but the main hypothesis is too weak. If fixed to use OuterMeasure (and preferably the Lebesgue outer measure), the statement would be faithful. Hence a mid score.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each Lean statement to natural language.
- Global context: n is a finite type (so matrices are n×n), R is a commutative ring, A : Matrix n n R. DecidableEq n and Fintype n are technical requirements for matrices and determinant in Mathlib.

- Theorem det_eq_zero_iff_cols_linear_dependent:
  ""For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, det A = 0 if and only if the columns of A are not linearly independent (i.e., they are linearly dependent).""

- Theorem det_ne_zero_imp_cols_linear_independent:
  ""For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, if det A ≠ 0 then the columns of A are linearly independent.""

- Theorem det_eq_zero_iff_rows_linear_dependent:
  ""For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, det A = 0 if and only if the rows of A are not linearly independent (i.e., they are linearly dependent).""

- Theorem det_ne_zero_imp_rows_linear_independent:
  ""For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, if det A ≠ 0 then the rows of A are linearly independent.""

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""Suppose A is n×n with det(A)=0. Prove columns (or rows) are linearly dependent. Also if det(A) ≠ 0 prove columns (or rows) are linearly independent."" No Laplace formula requirement is about proof method, which is irrelevant here since proofs are omitted.

- Content match:
  • The Lean code includes both directions for columns and rows: det=0 ⇒ dependent, and det≠0 ⇒ independent. Moreover, it even states the stronger equivalences (det=0 ↔ not LI) for both columns and rows.
  • So in terms of logical strength, the Lean statements cover and strengthen what is asked.

- Scope/generalization issue:
  • The NL problem is typically over a field (or at least an integral domain). Over a general commutative ring, the implication det ≠ 0 ⇒ columns/rows are linearly independent is false. Counterexample: R = Z/6Z, A = [2] (1×1). det A = 2 ≠ 0, but the single column vector 2 is not linearly independent since 3⋅2 = 0 with 3 ≠ 0.
  • Similarly, the equivalences det A = 0 ↔ ¬ LI for columns/rows fail over general commutative rings (the ""←"" direction can fail).
  • The implication det = 0 ⇒ dependent is fine over commutative rings, but the other implication is not.

Thus, the Lean statements assert results over [CommRing R] that are only valid in more restrictive settings (e.g., [Field R] or at least [IsDomain R]). This is not a harmless generalization; it changes the truth of the statements in the intended algebraic context.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  • The Lean code claims equivalences and implications over arbitrary commutative rings, which is stronger and in fact incorrect in that generality. The natural language problem (implicitly over a field) would be correct; the Lean version is not faithful because it weakens the hypotheses too much.
  • Otherwise, conceptually (columns/rows, determinant zero vs nonzero) the structure matches, and no vacuous placeholders were introduced.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to incorrect generality (CommRing instead of Field/IsDomain), even though the statements themselves align in form and intention. A faithful translation would require assuming [Field R] (or similar) for the nonzero determinant ⇒ linear independence direction and the equivalences.

A formal statement of the following (van Kampen-style) assertion:

Suppose that X is a path connected and locally simply connected topological space,
with a covering by path connected open sets {X_a}_{a ∈ A}, so that every finite
intersection X_{ab} := X_a ∩ X_b is also path connected. Let π := π_1(X,x_0)
and π_a := π_1(X_a,x_0), and so on. Take a group Γ and group morphisms
π_a → Γ which agree on every π_{ab}, for every a,b. Then there is a unique
group morphism π → Γ extending the given morphisms π_a → Γ.

This file translates that statement to Lean. We do not give a proof; the
statement is ended with `:= by sorry` as required.

Translate: Let X be a topological space and let ~ be an equivalence relation on X with quotient map
q : X → X/~. Show that any continuous map h : X/~ → Y induces a continuous map h ∘ q : X → Y.
Conversely, show that a continuous map f : X → Y arises in this way (i.e., f = h ∘ q for a unique
continuous h) iff f is constant on equivalence classes: f x1 = f x2 whenever x1 ~ x2.

We state the two lemmas below. Proofs are omitted (by sorry).
