The generating function for the number p(n) of partitions of n is

  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p(n) x^{n} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1-x^{k}}.

We state this classical identity in the comment above. A full formal
formalization (defining p(n) and proving the coefficient-wise equality)
is omitted. Below we provide a placeholder theorem (to be replaced by a
full formal statement and proof).
