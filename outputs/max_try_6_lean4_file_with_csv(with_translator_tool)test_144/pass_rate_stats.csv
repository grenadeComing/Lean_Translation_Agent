1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- `def dot_fin1 (x y : Fin 1 → ℝ) : ℝ := x 0 * y 0`: Defines a dot product on R^1 (represented as functions `Fin 1 → ℝ`) to be the product of the single coordinates, i.e., x·y = x(0) * y(0). This is a legitimate and faithful definition of the standard dot product in one dimension.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_18b : ∀ (x : Fin 1 → ℝ), x ≠ (fun _ => 0 : Fin 1 → ℝ) → ¬ ∃ (y : Fin 1 → ℝ), y ≠ (fun _ => 0 : Fin 1 → ℝ) ∧ dot_fin1 x y = 0 := by sorry`: For every vector x in R^1, if x is nonzero, then there does not exist a vector y in R^1 such that y is nonzero and the dot product x·y (as defined above) equals 0. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is clear.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: ""If k = 1 and x ∈ R^k, prove that there does not exist y ∈ R^k such that y ≠ 0 but x · y = 0.""
- The Lean theorem includes an additional hypothesis: x ≠ 0. The NL statement, as written, does not state this hypothesis; it asserts the nonexistence for any x ∈ R^1. Without the hypothesis x ≠ 0, the claim is false (take x = 0 and any nonzero y, then x·y = 0). Thus the Lean statement is not logically equivalent to the given NL statement; it proves a restricted version that is actually true, while the provided NL statement is false as written. Therefore, the translation is not faithful to the exact statement provided.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different: the Lean code requires x ≠ 0, while the NL statement does not. All other aspects (working in R^1, standard dot product behavior) are consistent, and the auxiliary definition `dot_fin1` is a legitimate, faithful definition. The mismatch is the missing nonzeroness assumption in the NL statement.

Additional notes per guidelines:
- No vacuous placeholders: `dot_fin1` is a proper definition, not a dummy. No other auxiliary definitions are suspicious.
- Use of Mathlib terms: While the code does not use Mathlib's Euclidean space/dot product notions, the custom definition is correct for k = 1 and is acceptable for faithful translation. The core issue remains the added hypothesis.

Given this, the translation fails to be faithful to the provided NL statement due to the extra hypothesis x ≠ 0.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code: There is no Lean code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""). Thus, there are no lines to translate, no definitions, no theorems, and no statements to interpret.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement: The natural language statement asserts: ""Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field.""

Therefore, the provided (nonexistent) code does not express, formalize, or even approximate the intended mathematical claim.

3) Final check: The math problems are different: the NL statement is a specific theorem about the impossibility of an ordered field structure on the complex numbers; the absent Lean code contains no theorem, no definition, and no claim. Hence they are not the same.

Given there is no code to audit and thus no faithful translation, this fails under the strict guidelines.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_4 {R : Type _} [Preorder R] {E : Set R} (hNE : E.Nonempty) {a b : R} (ha : ∀ x ∈ E, a ≤ x) (hb : ∀ x ∈ E, x ≤ b) : a ≤ b := by sorry`
  - This states: For a type `R` equipped with a `Preorder` (a reflexive, transitive relation `≤`), and a subset `E : Set R` that is nonempty (`E.Nonempty`), and elements `a b : R`, if `a` is a lower bound of `E` (formally, `∀ x ∈ E, a ≤ x`) and `b` is an upper bound of `E` (formally, `∀ x ∈ E, x ≤ b`), then `a ≤ b`.
  - No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it’s a single theorem statement. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task since we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let E be a nonempty subset of an ordered set; suppose α is a lower bound of E and β is an upper bound of E. Prove that α ≤ β.”
- Lean: `R` is an “ordered set” modeled as `[Preorder R]`; `E` is a nonempty subset; `a` is a lower bound and `b` is an upper bound, concluding `a ≤ b`.
- The only subtlety: the code uses `Preorder` rather than a stronger `PartialOrder` or `LinearOrder`. The statement does not require antisymmetry or totality—only transitivity—so a preorder suffices. This is a mild generalization of “ordered set” (which some authors mean as partial or total order), but it does not distort the intended meaning of the exercise.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches: same hypotheses (nonempty set, lower and upper bounds) and same conclusion (`a ≤ b`). No extraneous assumptions; no weakening that would invalidate the claim. The use of `Preorder` is a slight strengthening/generalization but remains faithful to the statement’s intent.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful. Slight generalization noted but acceptable.

- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Complex` allows writing `abs` as `Complex.abs` conveniently and access to complex-related notations.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_1_12 {n : Nat} (z : Fin n → Complex) : Complex.abs (∑ i : Fin n, z i) ≤ ∑ i : Fin n, Complex.abs (z i) := by sorry`
  This states: For any natural number n and any n-tuple of complex numbers (represented as a function z from the finite index type Fin n to Complex), the absolute value of the sum of the z i is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values of the z i. The sums are finite sums over all i in Fin n.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For complex numbers z1, ..., zn, |z1 + ... + zn| ≤ |z1| + ... + |zn|.
- The Lean statement encodes exactly this, using Fin n to index the n complex numbers and finite sums. Complex.abs corresponds to |·| on C. The inequality is exactly the n-term triangle inequality.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing difference (1..n vs Fin n) is a notational choice; mathematically equivalent.
- Edge case n = 0 is included in the Lean version; the inequality still holds (0 ≤ 0), so this is a harmless strengthening, not a mismatch.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly matches the intended theorem.

- Comment: ""Parallelogram identity in R^n: for vectors x y : Fin n → ℝ, ‖x + y‖^2 + ‖x - y‖^2 = 2 * ‖x‖^2 + 2 * ‖y‖^2."" This describes the intended statement.

  This declares a theorem for vectors x and y of type `Fin n → ℝ` asserting the parallelogram identity in terms of the norm `‖·‖` on that space. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For x, y in ℝ^k, |x + y|^2 + |x − y|^2 = 2|x|^2 + 2|y|^2. In standard mathematical usage, |·| on ℝ^k denotes the Euclidean norm (the one induced by the standard inner product).
- In mathlib, the type `Fin n → ℝ` carries by default the sup (ℓ∞) norm from the pi-type normed group structure, not the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm. The parallelogram identity is characteristic of norms induced by inner products (in particular the Euclidean norm), and it generally fails for the sup norm.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem as stated is about the parallelogram identity for the sup norm on `Fin n → ℝ`, which is not the same as the Euclidean ℝ^k case in the natural statement.
- The correct faithful formalization should use the Euclidean norm, e.g. by working in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` or, more generally, in any `InnerProductSpace ℝ E`. For example:
  `theorem parallelogram (E) [InnerProductSpace ℝ E] (x y : E) : ‖x + y‖^2 + ‖x - y‖^2 = 2 * ‖x‖^2 + 2 * ‖y‖^2 := ...`
  or specifically for `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.
- The variable name change k ↔ n is fine. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing (no proof required), and there are no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The only issue is the mismatch of the normed structure.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code states the parallelogram identity for the sup norm on `Fin n → ℝ`, whereas the natural statement requires the Euclidean norm on ℝ^k. This is a substantive semantic difference.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the norm/space mismatch. A faithful version must use `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (or an inner product space) so that the norm is the Euclidean one.

  Translation: Let r be a rational number, x a real number, assume r ≠ 0, and assume x is irrational (i.e., for every rational q, q ≠ x as real numbers). Then for every rational q, q ≠ r * x (as real numbers). In other words, r * x is irrational. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If r is rational (r ≠ 0) and x is irrational, then r x is irrational (over the reals). The Lean statement exactly formalizes this, with r : ℚ, x : ℝ, hypothesis r ≠ 0, hypothesis that x is irrational encoded as “not equal to any rational real,” and conclusion that r * x is not equal to any rational real. This is a faithful formalization.
- It uses a standard equivalent formulation of irrationality; while Mathlib has `Irrational x`, the provided `∀ q, (q : ℝ) ≠ x` is a faithful and even slightly stronger constructive statement than `¬∃ q, (q:ℝ)=x`, matching the intended meaning.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable given the task is about translation, not proof.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Implicitly about real numbers in the NL statement; the Lean code fixes x : ℝ, consistent.
- Assumptions: r rational and nonzero; x irrational. Matches exactly.
- Conclusion: r * x is irrational, i.e., unequal to any rational real. Matches exactly.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem Rudin_exercise_2_27b {k : ℕ} {E : Set (Fin k → ℝ)} (hE : ¬ Set.Countable E) : ...`:
  • We fix a natural number k and consider E as a subset of ℝ^k, represented as `Fin k → ℝ`.
  • The hypothesis `hE : ¬ Set.Countable E` asserts E is uncountable.
- Conclusion: `Set.Countable (E \ { x | ∀ r, 0 < r → ¬ Set.Countable (E ∩ Metric.ball x r) })`:
  • Define P implicitly as `{x | ∀ r > 0, ¬ Set.Countable (E ∩ Metric.ball x r)}`. This is the set of condensation points of E: every open ball around x meets E in an uncountable set.
  • The statement asserts `E \ P` is countable, i.e., at most countably many points of E are not condensation points.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: E ⊆ ℝ^k is uncountable; P is the set of condensation points of E; prove at most countably many points of E are not in P (i.e., E \ P is countable).
- The Lean statement matches exactly:
  • E ⊆ ℝ^k (via `Fin k → ℝ`).
  • Uncountability of E: `¬ Set.Countable E`.
  • P as condensation points: `∀ r > 0, ¬ Set.Countable (E ∩ ball(x,r))` correctly encodes that every neighborhood (open balls form a neighborhood basis) contains uncountably many points of E.
  • Conclusion: `Set.Countable (E \ P)`.

3) Final check for differences or issues:
- Using open balls with `r > 0` is equivalent to ""every neighborhood"" in ℝ^k, so the definition of condensation point is correct.
- `¬ Set.Countable` matches “uncountable.”
- P is defined in the ambient space (not restricted to E), and then `E \ P` picks exactly those points of E that are not condensation points; this matches the phrasing “points of E are not in P.”
- The representation of ℝ^k as `Fin k → ℝ` is standard in mathlib; allowing k = 0 does not create a mismatch with the statement—it’s still correct (and vacuously fine), and the hypothesis demands uncountability anyway.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the only sorry is for the proof, which we are not grading for content.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `by sorry`: Proof omitted (acceptable per instructions).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If Σ a_n converges and a_n ≥ 0, then Σ sqrt(a_n)/n converges. The Lean theorem assumes nonnegativity `∀ n, 0 ≤ a n`, convergence `Summable a`, and concludes convergence of the series with terms `sqrt(a(n+1))/(n+1)`, i.e., the series starting at n=1 for `sqrt(a_n)/n`. The index shift avoids division by zero and is mathematically equivalent.
- The sequence is over ℝ, which is the standard intended setting for nonnegative terms and square roots. Summable in Mathlib means standard (not necessarily absolute) convergence; with nonnegative terms this matches the usual notion of series convergence.
- No auxiliary (vacuous) definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof. This satisfies the requirement that the translation itself be faithful.

3) Final comparison:
- Both statements assert: from convergence of Σ a_n with a_n ≥ 0, infer convergence of Σ sqrt(a_n)/n. The Lean code expresses exactly this, with a harmless index shift to start at 1. There are no extra or missing hypotheses.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asks: If |z| = 1 (equivalently z \bar z = 1), compute |1+z|^2 + |1−z|^2. The intended computation is 4. The Lean theorem asserts exactly that under the equivalent hypothesis z * conj z = 1, the expression equals 4. This is a faithful formalization of the problem and its answer.

3) Final check:
- Hypothesis equivalence: |z| = 1 is equivalent to z \bar z = 1 for complex z. The code uses the latter.

- `(∀ A ∈ T, ∀ B ∈ T, A ≠ B → A ∩ B = ∅) ∧` and any two distinct sets in T are disjoint (their intersection is empty),
- `s = ⋃₀ T` and s is exactly the union (sUnion) of all sets in T.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: every open set in ℝ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments. In standard formulations, this means a decomposition into pairwise disjoint open intervals (connected components), which may include unbounded intervals of the form (a, ∞), (−∞, b), or even ℝ itself.
- The Lean statement requires every interval to be of the form `Ioo a b` (i.e., (a, b) with finite endpoints). This excludes unbounded open intervals. Therefore, open sets like (0, ∞), (−∞, 0), or ℝ cannot be represented as a disjoint union of intervals all of the form (a, b) with finite endpoints, as required by the Lean statement.
- Consequently, the Lean code asserts a stronger (and false) claim for such open sets, whereas the natural language statement allows the usual decomposition that includes unbounded open intervals.
- Other aspects match: at most countable (Countable T), disjointness (expressed via empty intersections for distinct sets), and exact union.

Final comparison:
- The key mismatch is that the Lean code excludes unbounded open intervals by forcing `I = Ioo a b`. The natural language statement (as commonly understood and in Rudin’s exercise) allows components to be unbounded open intervals. Hence, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [MetricSpace X] [MetricSpace Y]`: X and Y are metric spaces.
- `variable {f g : X → Y} {E : Set X}`: f and g are functions from X to Y, and E is a subset of X.
- The theorem `continuous_eq_on_dense (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) (hE : Dense E) (h : ∀ p ∈ E, f p = g p) : ∀ p : X, f p = g p` states: If f and g are continuous maps from the metric space X to the metric space Y, E is dense in X, and f and g agree on E (i.e., for all p in E, f p = g p), then f and g agree everywhere on X (i.e., for all p in X, f p = g p).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: Let f and g be continuous mappings of a metric space X into a metric space Y, and let E be a dense subset of X. Prove that if g(p) = f(p) for all p ∈ P then g(p) = f(p) for all p ∈ X.
- The Lean statement matches this exactly, with the minor notational correction that the dense subset is called E in the code and the condition is stated as ∀ p ∈ E, f p = g p. The target being metric ensures Hausdorffness, which is standard for this result. No extra or missing hypotheses.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The only discrepancy is a likely typo in the natural language using P instead of E. The code uses E consistently as the dense set. The substantive mathematical content is identical: continuity of f and g, E dense in X, equality on E implies equality on all of X.

Auxiliary definitions/proofs:
- No auxiliary (vacuous) definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated using standard Mathlib notions (MetricSpace, Continuous, Dense). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing. There are no placeholders redefining core concepts.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators` are setup.
- The theorem `Rudin_exercise_3_13` is stated for sequences `a b : ℕ → ℝ`.
- Hypotheses: `ha : Summable fun n => |a n|` and `hb : Summable fun n => |b n|` mean both series ∑ |a n| and ∑ |b n| converge (absolute convergence of the series with terms a_n and b_n).
- Conclusion: `Summable fun n => |Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)|` states that the series with terms `|∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}|` is summable. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` indexes k = 0, 1, ..., n, so the inner finite sum is exactly the n-th Cauchy product coefficient `c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}`. Thus the statement asserts that ∑ |c_n| converges, i.e., the Cauchy product converges absolutely.

2) Whole translation vs original:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely.”
- The Lean theorem assumes absolute convergence of the two input series and concludes absolute convergence of their Cauchy product (with coefficients c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}). This is exactly the content of the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Field: The code works over ℝ, while the statement is generic (often ℝ or ℂ). Specializing to ℝ is acceptable and still faithful to the statement.
- The theorem does not assert the value of the sum equals the product of sums, only absolute convergence, which matches the natural language requirement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the only omission is the proof (`sorry`), which is allowed for this audit.

Conclusion: The code precisely formalizes the claim that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely (in ℝ), with correct indexing and absolute values.

- Comment: States the intended exercise: existence of a subset E of R and a continuous f on E that cannot be extended to a continuous g on R.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_5b : ∃ (E : Set ℝ) (f : Subtype E → ℝ), Continuous f ∧ ¬ ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g ∧ ∀ x : Subtype E, g x = f x := by sorry`
  This asserts: There exists a subset E of the reals and a function f from the subtype E (i.e., the set E with the subspace topology) to ℝ such that f is continuous, and there does not exist a continuous function g: ℝ → ℝ with the property that for all x in the subtype E, g x = f x. The quantification `∀ x : Subtype E` means for all points x in E, considering the coercion of Subtype E to ℝ when evaluating g, i.e., g restricted to E equals f.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement asks for a subset E ⊂ ℝ and a real continuous function f defined on E such that no continuous real function g on ℝ agrees with f on all of E. Representing a function defined on E as `f : Subtype E → ℝ` with `Continuous f` (relative to the subspace topology) matches the intended meaning of “real continuous function on E.” The nonexistence clause `¬ ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g ∧ ∀ x : Subtype E, g x = f x` matches “there does not exist a continuous real function g on ℝ such that g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.” The use of `Subtype E` and coercion in `g x` corresponds exactly to evaluating g on the underlying real number of x ∈ E.
- The code does not add extraneous assumptions (e.g., it does not require E to be proper or nonempty), which is appropriate: the impossibility of extension already forces E to be a proper nonempty subset implicitly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain and continuity notions are standard and correct in Mathlib (subtype topology for E). The quantification over `Subtype E` is equivalent to “for all x ∈ E,” via coercion. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is exactly the requested existence claim.
- No discrepancies found.

- The quantification “for every Cauchy sequence {x_n}” is represented by having x : ℕ → X arbitrary and assuming hx : CauchySeq x; this yields CauchySeq (f ∘ x), which is the sequence {f(x_n)}.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The docstring states: Suppose K and F are disjoint sets in a metric space X, K is compact, F is closed. There exists δ > 0 such that dist p q ≥ δ for all p ∈ K and q ∈ F. This matches the formal statement that follows, with ≥.
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_4_21a {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] {K F : Set X}`: In a metric space X, with sets K and F.
- Hypotheses: `hK : IsCompact K` (K is compact), `hF : IsClosed F` (F is closed), `hdis : Disjoint K F` (K and F are disjoint).
- Conclusion: `∃ δ > 0, ∀ p ∈ K, ∀ q ∈ F, δ ≤ dist p q`. There exists δ > 0 such that for all p in K and q in F, the distance from p to q is at least δ.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: Suppose K and F are disjoint in a metric space X, K compact, F closed. Prove there exists δ > 0 such that d(p, q) > δ if p ∈ K, q ∈ F.
Lean: Same hypotheses, and the conclusion is existence of δ > 0 with dist(p, q) ≥ δ for all p ∈ K, q ∈ F.

Step 3: Are they the same mathematically?
- The only discrepancy is strict (>) vs non-strict (≥) inequality in the conclusion. As existential statements, these are logically equivalent:
  - If there exists δ > 0 with dist ≥ δ uniformly, then taking δ' = δ/2 > 0 yields dist > δ' uniformly.
  - Conversely, if there exists δ > 0 with dist > δ uniformly, then certainly dist ≥ δ uniformly with the same δ.
Thus the Lean statement is equivalent to the natural language statement.

Additional checks:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- All concepts use proper Mathlib notions (MetricSpace, IsCompact, IsClosed, Disjoint, dist).
- Quantifiers and domain match exactly.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully (indeed slightly stronger in form, but equivalent) translates the natural language statement.

  Natural language: There exists a function f: ℝ → ℝ such that for every real x, the function h ↦ f(x + h) − f(x − h) tends to 0 as h → 0 (i.e., lim_{h→0} [f(x+h) − f(x−h)] = 0), and f is not continuous as a function ℝ → ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original asks to show that the condition ""for every x, lim_{h→0} [f(x+h) − f(x−h)] = 0"" does not force continuity; i.e., f need not be continuous. This is exactly an existential counterexample statement: there exists f with that limit property but not continuous. The Lean theorem precisely asserts existence of such an f, using standard Mathlib notions `Tendsto ... (nhds 0) (nhds 0)` to encode the limit being 0 and `¬Continuous` for non-continuity.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Limit formulation: Matches exactly (Tendsto to nhds 0 is the limit equals 0).

- Conclusion: Not continuous (global continuity), matching ""does not need to be continuous"".

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_3 {g : ℝ → ℝ} (M : ℝ) (hder : ∀ x, |deriv g x| ≤ M) :` 
  For a function g: ℝ → ℝ and a real number M, assume that for all x, the (Lean-defined) derivative `deriv g x` satisfies |deriv g x| ≤ M.
- `∃ ε0 > 0, ∀ ε, 0 < ε → ε < ε0 → Function.Injective (fun x => x + ε * g x)` 
  There exists ε0 > 0 such that for all ε with 0 < ε < ε0, the function f(x) = x + ε*g(x) is injective.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL: g is a real function on ℝ with bounded derivative (|g'| ≤ M), fix ε > 0, define f(x) = x + ε g(x). Prove f is one-to-one if ε is small enough. 
- Lean: Exactly asserts existence of ε0 > 0 so that for all ε in (0, ε0), f(x) = x + ε g(x) is injective. Domain is ℝ, codomain ℝ, same f. This matches the intended “for small enough ε” quantification.

Key discrepancy:
- In Mathlib, `deriv g x` is defined to be the derivative where it exists and 0 otherwise. The Lean hypothesis `∀ x, |deriv g x| ≤ M` does NOT assert that g is differentiable everywhere. The natural language statement “g has bounded derivative (|g'| ≤ M)” standardly means g is differentiable everywhere on ℝ and the derivative is bounded by M. The Lean assumption is strictly weaker and can hold even if g is not differentiable at many points (since `deriv` defaults to 0 there). Thus the Lean theorem states a stronger claim under weaker hypotheses than the original.

Other aspects:
- Using Function.Injective is standard.
- ℝ vs R^1 is consistent.
- The quantification over ε and the conclusion match the intent of “small enough ε”.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof, which is fine for translation auditing.

Final check: The two problems are not the same because the Lean version omits the essential differentiability assumption implicit in “bounded derivative,” relying on Mathlib’s `deriv` convention. This is a meaningful mismatch.

- `(h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Set.Ioi (0 : ℝ)))`: f is differentiable at every point x with x > 0 (i.e., on (0, ∞)).
- `(h_deriv : Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) atTop (𝓝 (0 : ℝ)))`: The derivative function x ↦ f'(x) tends to 0 as x → +∞ (filter atTop on ℝ).
- `Tendsto (fun x => f (x + 1) - f x) atTop (𝓝 (0 : ℝ))`: The function g(x) = f(x+1) − f(x) tends to 0 as x → +∞.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it uses standard Mathlib notions: `DifferentiableOn`, `deriv`, `Tendsto`, `atTop`.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumption: “f is defined and differentiable for every x > 0” matches `DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Ioi 0)` (differentiable on (0, ∞)). In Lean, f is globally defined on ℝ; this is a harmless strengthening that does not affect the statement about behavior as x → +∞.
- The natural language: “f′(x) → 0 as x → +∞” matches `Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) atTop (𝓝 0)`.
- The conclusion: “Put g(x) = f(x+1) − f(x). Prove that g(x) → 0 as x → +∞” matches the Lean conclusion.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain subtlety: The original only requires f to be defined on (0, ∞); the Lean statement considers a total function f : ℝ → ℝ but only assumes differentiability on (0, ∞). This is standard and does not change the mathematical content of the limit as x → +∞. The limit filter atTop eventually lies in (0, ∞), so the use of `deriv f` is appropriate.
- Use of `deriv` versus a one-sided notion: Since we are in the interior (x > 0), `deriv` is the correct derivative, matching the original statement.
- No vacuous placeholders; all terms are standard Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

The natural language statement claims: The collection of open intervals with rational endpoints {(a,b) | a < b, a and b rational} is a basis that generates the standard topology on R. A faithful Lean translation would need to define this collection, assert it is a topological basis (using Mathlib's IsTopologicalBasis or TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis), and show it generates the standard topology on ℝ (i.e., the existing TopologicalSpace ℝ). Since there is no code, none of this is expressed.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_17 {f : ℝ → ℝ}`: We consider a real-valued function defined on ℝ.
- Hypothesis `hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 3 f (Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1)`: f is 3-times continuously differentiable (C^3) on the closed interval [-1, 1]. In mathlib, `ContDiffOn ℝ 3` is a strong hypothesis meaning existence of derivatives up to order 3 with continuity on the set.
- Hypothesis `hvals : f (-1) = 0 ∧ f 0 = 0 ∧ f 1 = 1`: The function values are f(-1)=0, f(0)=0, f(1)=1.
- Hypothesis `hder0 : deriv f 0 = 0`: The derivative at 0 is 0, i.e., f'(0)=0. Here `deriv` is the usual real derivative.
- Conclusion: `∃ x ∈ Set.Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≥ 3`: There exists x in the open interval (-1,1) such that the third derivative f'''(x) is at least 3. The expression `deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x` denotes f'''(x).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original hypotheses: “f is a real, three times differentiable function on [-1,1], with f(-1)=0, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f'(0)=0.” This typically means the third derivative exists (not necessarily continuous) on the interior and the relevant derivatives exist at points where stated.
- Lean hypotheses: `ContDiffOn ℝ 3` requires three continuous derivatives on [-1,1], which is strictly stronger than merely being three times differentiable. The value conditions and f'(0)=0 match exactly.
- Conclusion: Both assert the existence of x in (-1,1) with f^{(3)}(x) ≥ 3. This matches.

Potential subtlety about `deriv`: In mathlib, `deriv f x` is defined (defaulting to 0 if not differentiable), but the `ContDiffOn ℝ 3` hypothesis ensures differentiability up to order 3 on the interval, so at any interior point the third derivative exists. Thus the conclusion is meaningful under the given Lean hypotheses.

Final check:
- The only discrepancy is that the Lean code uses a stronger smoothness assumption (`ContDiffOn ℝ 3`, i.e., C^3) rather than mere thrice differentiable. This strengthens the hypothesis and so the Lean theorem is a stronger statement than the original. Everything else matches.

Verdict:
- Not fully faithful due to the stronger differentiability hypothesis. Otherwise, the translation is accurate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Rudin_exercise_5_7 {f g : ℝ → ℝ} {f_der g_der : ℝ} {x : ℝ} (hf : HasDerivAt f f_der x) (hg : HasDerivAt g g_der x) (hg_ne : g_der ≠ 0) (hf0 : f x = 0) (hg0 : g x = 0) : Tendsto (fun t => f t / g t) (nhds x) (nhds (f_der / g_der)) := by sorry`
  This states: Let f,g : ℝ → ℝ be differentiable at x with derivatives f_der and g_der at x, with g_der ≠ 0, and f(x) = 0, g(x) = 0. Then the function t ↦ f(t)/g(t) tends to f_der/g_der along the (unrestricted) neighborhood filter nhds x.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The original statement: Suppose f'(x), g'(x) exist, g'(x) ≠ 0, and f(x) = g(x) = 0. Prove lim_{t→x} f(t)/g(t) = f'(x)/g'(x).
- In standard analysis, “lim_{t→x}” denotes the limit as t approaches x without requiring any condition at t = x, i.e., it ignores the value at x and considers t ≠ x implicitly. In mathlib, this is expressed with the filter 𝓝[≠] x (the neighborhood within {t | t ≠ x}).
- The Lean statement uses `Tendsto ... (nhds x) ...`, i.e., the unrestricted neighborhood filter at x. This is stronger: it forces the behavior also along sequences eventually equal to x. Because Lean defines 0/0 = 0 on ℝ (via inv 0 = 0), the value of `f t / g t` at t = x is 0/0 = 0, so `Tendsto ... (nhds x)` would force the limit to be 0. Hence the conclusion `nhds (f_der / g_der)` can only hold if `f_der/g_der = 0`, which is not what the natural language statement claims in general. Therefore the Lean statement is strictly stronger and, in general, false under the given hypotheses.

3) Final comparison:
- Same hypotheses? Yes.
- Same conclusion? No. The Lean code asserts `Tendsto ... (nhds x) ...`, i.e., an unrestricted limit at x, whereas the natural language statement refers to the usual punctured limit (ignoring the value at x). The correct formalization should use `Tendsto (fun t => f t / g t) (nhdsWithin x {t | t ≠ x}) (nhds (f_der / g_der))`, or equivalently restrict to the set where `g ≠ 0` near x.
- No vacuous placeholders: correct. Mathlib notions are used properly, except for the filter.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the crucial mismatch of filters; it strengthens the claim improperly and changes the mathematical meaning.

- The natural language statement asserts that the set of all open rectangles in R^2 with rational endpoints forms a countable basis for the standard topology on R^2.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code imports Mathlib.
- It states a theorem `Munkres_exercise_18_8a` for arbitrary types `X` and `Y` equipped with topologies `[TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`.
- It assumes an order structure on `Y` via `[Preorder Y]` and, crucially, the topological compatibility property `[OrderClosedTopology Y]`.
- It takes continuous functions `f g : X → Y` with hypotheses `hf : Continuous f` and `hg : Continuous g`.
- The conclusion is `IsClosed { x | f x ≤ g x }`, i.e., the set of points where `f x ≤ g x` is closed in `X`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: ""Let Y be an ordered set in the order topology. Let f, g: X → Y be continuous. Show that the set {x | f(x) ≤ g(x)} is closed in X.""
- Intended assumptions: Y is an ordered set endowed with the order topology (typically a linear order with the order topology). In Mathlib this would normally be modeled via `[Preorder Y]` (or `[LinearOrder Y]`) together with `[OrderTopology Y]`.
- The Lean code instead assumes `[OrderClosedTopology Y]`, not `[OrderTopology Y]`. `OrderClosedTopology` is the property that the relation `≤` is a closed subset of `Y × Y`. While this property holds when `Y` has the order topology (so `OrderTopology` implies `OrderClosedTopology` in the standard settings), `OrderClosedTopology` is strictly a different (generally weaker) assumption and does not assert that the topology on `Y` is the order topology.
- The code also only requires a `Preorder`, not necessarily a linear order, which is again more general than the likely intent of ""ordered set in the order topology"" (which commonly means a linear order with its order topology).
- The conclusion `IsClosed { x | f x ≤ g x }` matches the target set and uses continuity of `f` and `g` appropriately.

3) Final check (faithfulness):
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is just a theorem statement (with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation checking).
- However, the hypotheses differ: the code assumes `[OrderClosedTopology Y]` instead of `[OrderTopology Y]` and allows a mere `Preorder` rather than a linear order. This generalizes the original statement. Although the result remains true under the original assumptions, the translation is not faithful to the exact specification of ""order topology"" in the NL statement. Since the instructions require a faithful translation (not merely a strengthening), this fails the strict criterion.

Therefore, the code is almost the same in spirit but not a faithful translation of the given assumptions.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem extension_unique {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`: We have topological spaces X and Y, with Y Hausdorff.
- `{A : Set X} {f : A → Y} {g1 g2 : X → Y}`: A is a subset of X; f is a function from the subtype A to Y; g1 and g2 are functions from X to Y (global functions, but we will only care about their behavior on closure A).
- `(hg1 : ContinuousOn g1 (closure A)) (hg2 : ContinuousOn g2 (closure A))`: g1 and g2 are continuous on the set closure A (equivalently, their restrictions to the subspace closure A → Y are continuous).
- `(h1 : ∀ x : A, g1 x = f x) (h2 : ∀ x : A, g2 x = f x)`: On A, both g1 and g2 agree with f (via the natural inclusion A → X).
- `: ∀ x ∈ closure A, g1 x = g2 x`: Conclusion: g1 and g2 agree on closure A (i.e., the extensions coincide on closure A).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
NL statement: Let A ⊂ X; let f: A → Y be continuous; Y Hausdorff. Show that if f may be extended to a continuous function g: closure A → Y, then g is uniquely determined by f.
- Hausdorff: matched by `[T2Space Y]`.
- Domain/codomain: A ⊂ X and functions into Y, matched.
- Continuity of extensions on closure A: the code encodes this by taking g1,g2 : X → Y and assuming `ContinuousOn` on `closure A` (this is the standard Lean way to talk about continuity as functions from `closure A` → Y, via restriction).
- Agreement on A: h1 and h2 encode that the two extensions agree with f on A.
- Conclusion: uniqueness on closure A is stated as pointwise equality on closure A, which is equivalent to the uniqueness of the continuous extension.

Two differences to note:
- The code does not assume f is continuous. This is harmless for the uniqueness statement (and in fact the existence of a continuous extension would imply f is continuous), so the theorem stated is slightly stronger than the NL version but fully captures the intended uniqueness claim.
- The extensions are modeled as functions X → Y with continuity only on closure A rather than as functions closure A → Y. This is a standard formal encoding in Lean, and the conclusion is equality on closure A; thus it is equivalent to saying the two continuous functions closure A → Y are equal.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorem asserts that any two continuous-on-closure-A extensions of f coincide on closure A, which is exactly the uniqueness of the continuous extension from closure A. The omitted assumption ""f is continuous"" does not affect the correctness of the uniqueness statement and is redundant if an extension exists. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all concepts are standard Mathlib ones.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Assessment vs. the natural language statement:
- The NL statement asks to show that the collection T_∞ = {U | X \ U is infinite or empty or all of X} need not be a topology on X. Providing a specific counterexample (here, X = Nat) with two sets in T_∞ whose union is not in T_∞ suffices to demonstrate that T_∞ need not be a topology in general. The code does exactly this: it defines T_∞ precisely as in the statement, picks specific U1 and U2, and asserts they are in T_∞ while their union is not.
- All auxiliary definitions (C1, C2, U1, U2) are meaningful and correctly constructed; there are no vacuous placeholders. There is no misuse of Mathlib terminology: Set.Infinite, univ, set difference, etc., are standard.
- The theorem is left with `sorry` (proof omitted), which is allowed under the instruction since we are auditing the translation of the statement, not its proof.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches: the code formalizes a concrete witness that T_∞ is not a topology for X = Nat, which proves the ""need not be a topology"" claim. There is no mismatch in definitions or intent.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `IsConnected C → C ∩ A ≠ ∅ → C ∩ Aᶜ ≠ ∅ → C ∩ frontier A ≠ ∅ := by sorry`: If the subset `C` is connected, and `C` intersects `A` (i.e., `C ∩ A ≠ ∅`) and also intersects the complement of `A` (i.e., `C ∩ Aᶜ ≠ ∅`), then `C` intersects the boundary of `A` (i.e., `C ∩ frontier A ≠ ∅`). Here `frontier A` is Mathlib’s standard boundary ∂A in `X`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let `A ⊂ X`. If `C` is a connected subspace of `X` that intersects both `A` and `X − A`, then `C` intersects `Bd A`.
- Correspondence:
  - `A ⊂ X` is modeled by `A : Set X` (subset of `X` by typing). Properness is not needed for the statement.
  - `C` connected subspace is `IsConnected C` in Mathlib (a property of a subset under the subspace topology).
  - Intersects both `A` and `X − A`: `C ∩ A ≠ ∅` and `C ∩ Aᶜ ≠ ∅` (where `Aᶜ` is the complement `X \ A`).
  - Intersects `Bd A`: `C ∩ frontier A ≠ ∅` (Mathlib’s `frontier` is the boundary in `X`).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct and uses standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given topological assertion. It uses the same concepts (connectedness of the subspace, intersections with `A` and its complement, and boundary) in standard Mathlib terminology. There are no hidden assumptions or weakened notions. The minor textual “A ⊂ X” is naturally captured by `A : Set X`.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem states: `¬ TendstoUniformlyOn (fun n x : ℕ × ℝ => (x.2 ^ n.1)) (fun x => if x = (1 : ℝ) then 1 else 0) atTop (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)`.
  Interpreting this (intended) meaning:
  • The index filter is `atTop` on ℕ, so we are considering the sequence indexed by n → ∞.
  • The set is `Icc (0 : ℝ) 1`, i.e., the closed interval [0,1].
  • The candidate limit function is `x ↦ if x = 1 then 1 else 0` (the usual pointwise limit of x^n on [0,1]).
  • The sequence is intended to be f_n(x) = x^n. The code writes `(fun n x : ℕ × ℝ => x.2 ^ n.1)`, which is an unusual binder notation; the evident intent is to represent the two-argument function (n, x) ↦ x^n. Assuming it compiles as given, it denotes the family n ↦ (x ↦ x^n).
  • The statement is: it is not the case that (f_n) converges uniformly on [0,1] to the function g(x) = 0 for x ≠ 1 and g(1) = 1.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Define f_n:[0,1] → ℝ by f_n(x) = x^n. Show that the sequence (f_n) does not converge uniformly.
- Lean: Shows ¬ TendstoUniformlyOn to the specific function g(x) = 1_{x=1} on [0,1]. This is the standard pointwise limit of x^n on [0,1].

Step 3: Are the math problems the same?
- Subtle but important difference: The natural statement “does not converge uniformly” typically means “there is no function g such that TendstoUniformlyOn (f_n) g atTop [0,1]”. The Lean statement only asserts “it does not converge uniformly to the particular function g(x) = 1_{x=1}”. While in this specific context the only possible uniform limit (if it existed) would be that pointwise limit, the Lean statement does not explicitly assert that f_n converges pointwise to g, nor does it quantify over all possible limits. Thus, as a standalone translation, it is weaker than “does not converge uniformly (to any function).”
- Apart from that, the domain [0,1], the definition f_n(x) = x^n, and the expected (non-)limit are all correctly represented.
- Minor syntactic oddity: the binder `(fun n x : ℕ × ℝ => x.2 ^ n.1)` is unusual; the intended meaning is clear (n : ℕ, x : ℝ ↦ x^n). Assuming compilation, it’s representing the right family.

Conclusion: Very close, but not fully faithful because it negates uniform convergence only to the specific candidate limit rather than asserting non-uniform convergence in general. Under the instruction to be extra harsh, this mismatch means it does not fully capture the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_fixed_point_of_continuous {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hf : ContinuousOn f (Set.Icc 0 1)) : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc 0 1, f x = x := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any function f : ℝ → ℝ that is continuous on the closed interval [0,1], there exists a point x in [0,1] such that f(x) = x.
  There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof.

2) Compare with the original statement:
- Original: Let f : X → X be continuous. If X = [0,1], then there is a point x with f(x) = x.
- Interpreting X = [0,1] and f : X → X means f maps [0,1] into itself and is continuous (on the subspace [0,1]). This is the classical fixed point result for continuous self-maps of [0,1].
- The Lean statement only assumes f : ℝ → ℝ is continuous on [0,1], but does not assume that f maps [0,1] into [0,1]. That is a crucial missing hypothesis. As written, the Lean theorem asserts a false statement (e.g., f(x) = x + 1 on [0,1] is continuous on [0,1] but has no fixed point in [0,1]).

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The original requires f : [0,1] → [0,1] (i.e., f maps the interval into itself), while the Lean code allows any f : ℝ → ℝ merely continuous on [0,1]. The missing “maps into [0,1]” hypothesis makes the Lean statement strictly stronger and false, hence not a faithful translation.
- Minor differences (acceptable if the main issue were fixed): using ContinuousOn on Icc 0 1 versus continuity on the subspace is fine; also quantifying over x ∈ Icc 0 1 is consistent with demanding the fixed point lie in the interval. But the essential mapping-into-self hypothesis is missing.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

To fix: Require either (a) f : Set.Icc 0 1 → Set.Icc 0 1 with continuity, or (b) f : ℝ → ℝ with ContinuousOn f (Icc 0 1) and MapsTo f (Icc 0 1) (Icc 0 1).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_16_1 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {Y A : Set X} (h : A ⊆ Y) : ... := by sorry`
  Statement: For a topological space X, and subsets Y, A of X with A ⊆ Y, we claim an equality of topologies described next.
- `let iY : Subtype Y → X := fun y => (y : X)`: Define the inclusion map of the subspace Y into X.
- `let iA_Y : Subtype A → Subtype Y := fun a => ⟨a.1, h a.2⟩`: Define the inclusion map of A into Y, using h : A ⊆ Y to certify membership in Y.
- `let iA_X : Subtype A → X := fun a => (a : X)`: Define the inclusion map of A directly into X.
- Claim: `TopologicalSpace.induced iA_Y (TopologicalSpace.induced iY (inferInstance : TopologicalSpace X)) = TopologicalSpace.induced iA_X (inferInstance : TopologicalSpace X)`.
  Interpretation: The topology on A induced from Y (where Y itself has the subspace topology induced from X) equals the topology on A induced directly from X. This is exactly the “subspace of a subspace” equals “subspace” fact, i.e., induced via composition equals induced via the composite map (and indeed `iY ∘ iA_Y = iA_X`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: If Y is a subspace of X and A is a subset of Y, then the topology A inherits as a subspace of Y is the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of X.
- The Lean statement models Y, A as subsets of X, with h : A ⊆ Y. It explicitly uses the subspace topology on Y as `TopologicalSpace.induced iY` from X, and then induces on A via `iA_Y`. It compares this with inducing on A directly from X via `iA_X`. The equality claimed is exactly the desired statement.
- Using `Set X` for both Y and A, together with `h : A ⊆ Y`, is a faithful encoding of “A is a subset of Y”. The use of `TopologicalSpace.induced` is the standard mathlib notion of subspace topology. No extraneous or placeholder definitions are made.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code states precisely the equality of the two induced topologies on the same underlying type `Subtype A`, matching the assertion that the two subspace topologies on A coincide.
- There are no mismatches in meaning; the helpers `iY`, `iA_Y`, `iA_X` are legitimate inclusions and not vacuous. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per instructions we only assess the statement/translation.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  `theorem countable_compactness_eq_limit_point_compactness_in_T1_space {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [T1Space X] : CountableCompactSpace X ↔ LimitPointCompactSpace X := by sorry`
  translates to: For any type X with a topology and satisfying the T1 separation axiom, X is countably compact if and only if X is limit point compact. Here, `CountableCompactSpace X` is Mathlib’s standard predicate meaning the space is countably compact, and `LimitPointCompactSpace X` is Mathlib’s standard predicate meaning the space is limit point compact. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is precisely the equivalence.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement defines countably compactness (every countable open cover has a finite subcover) and asks to show that in a T1 space, countable compactness is equivalent to limit point compactness. The Lean theorem states exactly this equivalence under the T1 assumption. It relies on Mathlib’s established notions of countable compactness and limit point compactness, which align with the standard definitions.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The assumptions (T1), the properties involved (countable compactness and limit point compactness), and the claimed relationship (equivalence) all match. There are no extra assumptions or missing conditions. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α] [RegularSpace α]`: We work on a type α equipped with a topology, and α is assumed to be a regular space (in Mathlib, RegularSpace is the standard class capturing regularity, typically including the T1 condition as in Munkres).
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_31_1 (x y : α) (hxy : x ≠ y) : ∃ U V : Set α, IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V ∧ (closure U ∩ closure V = ∅) := by sorry`: For any two distinct points x, y in α, there exist open sets U and V with x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and the closures of U and V are disjoint (their intersection is empty).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that if X is regular, every pair of points of X have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint.""
- The code assumes α is a regular space and asserts the existence of neighborhoods (open sets containing the points) with disjoint closures for any two points x ≠ y. This directly matches the intended meaning. Disjointness of closures is expressed as `closure U ∩ closure V = ∅`, and neighborhoods are enforced by `IsOpen U`, `IsOpen V`, with `x ∈ U`, `y ∈ V`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code includes the explicit hypothesis `x ≠ y`. This is standard and necessary: if x = y, it is impossible in general to find two neighborhoods of the same point with disjoint closures. The natural language statement informally refers to a ""pair of points"" which conventionally means distinct points in this context. Thus this is not a substantive divergence but an explicit formalization of an implicit requirement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. It uses standard Mathlib concepts (TopologicalSpace, RegularSpace, closure, IsOpen). The proof is elided (allowed), but the statement itself is a faithful formalization.

- Conclusion: `: CompactSpace X` states that X is compact.
There are no auxiliary fake definitions; all hypotheses use standard Mathlib notions (IsClosedMap, Continuous, Surjective, IsCompact, CompactSpace).

Natural language: Let p: X → Y be a closed continuous surjective map with compact fibers p^{-1}({y}) for each y. Show that if Y is compact, then X is compact.
Lean: Exactly assumes closed, continuous, surjective, compact fibers, and Y compact, and concludes X is compact.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean theorem precisely matches the mathematical content of the statement. The typeclass `[CompactSpace Y]` encodes “Y is compact,” and the conclusion `CompactSpace X` encodes “X is compact.”

- The Lean theorem asserts exactly: if X is locally compact and Hausdorff, then X is completely regular. This matches precisely.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- theorem Munkres_exercise_29_4 : ¬ LocallyCompactSpace (ℕ → UnitInterval) := by sorry: Assert that the space of all functions from ℕ to UnitInterval, equipped with the default topology on the function space in Lean (the Pi/product topology), is not locally compact.

Assessment of meaning:
- In Lean/Mathlib, (ℕ → UnitInterval) carries the product topology (induced by the Pi-type topology/uniformity). Under this topology, since UnitInterval is compact and the countable product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff), the space (ℕ → UnitInterval) is compact, hence locally compact. So the statement ¬ LocallyCompactSpace (ℕ → UnitInterval) is actually false under the default topology.
- The natural language statement explicitly says: Show that [0,1]^ω is not locally compact in the uniform topology. In Munkres, the “uniform topology” here refers to the topology induced by the sup metric (uniform convergence on the index set), which is strictly finer than the product topology and indeed not locally compact. This is different from the product topology used by default in Lean for function spaces.

Comparison to the original statement:
- The Lean code does not mention or implement the “uniform topology” (sup-metric topology). It uses the default product topology on ℕ → UnitInterval.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is about a different topological space than the one in the natural language statement. Moreover, the result stated in Lean is false for the product topology, while the natural language result is true for the uniform (sup-metric) topology.
- There are no vacuous placeholder definitions; UnitInterval is legitimate. However, the central mismatch is the topology: uniform vs product.

Final check: The two problems are different. The Lean statement does not faithfully translate the natural language statement because it uses the product topology instead of the uniform (sup) topology.

Grade justification:
- Related topic and objects, but the key structure (topology) is wrong, leading to a non-faithful and actually incorrect assertion in Lean. Hence a low grade.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's definitions and theorems.
- The docstring accurately restates the natural language claim: Given an open map p : X → Y and A open in X, the restriction q : A → p '' A is an open map.
- `theorem munkres_exercise_22_5 {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : X → Y) (hp : IsOpenMap p) (A : Set X) (hA : IsOpen A) : IsOpenMap ((fun x : Subtype A => ⟨p x.1, Set.mem_image_of_mem p x.2⟩) : Subtype A → p '' A) := by sorry`
  • X, Y are types with topological spaces.
  • p : X → Y, and hp : IsOpenMap p means p is an open map in the Mathlib sense.
  • A : Set X with hA : IsOpen A.
  • The goal states: the function `q : Subtype A → p '' A` given by `q x = ⟨p x.1, proof that p x.1 ∈ p '' A⟩` is an open map. Here `Subtype A` is the subspace A ⊆ X with the induced topology, and `p '' A` is the image subset of Y, seen as a subtype with the subspace topology. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this auditing task since we're checking the statement/translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: If p is an open map and A is open in X, then the restricted map q : A → p(A) is an open map. In Lean, this is precisely encoded by `IsOpenMap` of the function `Subtype A → p '' A` mapping x ↦ p x. The use of subtypes captures the subspace topologies on A and p(A), which is exactly what the statement intends.
- The hypothesis `hA : IsOpen A` is present, matching the NL assumption.
- The function defined is exactly the restriction of p to A with codomain restricted to p(A).

3) Final check for differences:
- Codomain: NL uses p(A); Lean uses `p '' A` (standard notation for the image set), treated as a subtype of Y with the subspace topology—this matches the intended meaning.
- No extraneous/vacuous definitions are introduced; all constructs are standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` affects only the proof, not the statement.
- No mismatch in quantifiers or properties.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and precise formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Munkres_exercise_30_10 {ι : Type*} [Countable ι] {X : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]`: Let ι be a type equipped with a `Countable` instance (so the index set is countable). Let X be a family of types indexed by ι, each with a topology; thus the product Π i, X i carries the product (Pi) topology.
- `(s : ∀ i, Set (X i))`: For each i, we are given a subset s i of X i.
- `(h : ∀ i, s i.Countable ∧ Dense (s i))`: For each i, the subset s i is countable and dense in X i.
- `: ∃ S : Set (∀ i, X i), S.Countable ∧ Dense S`: Then there exists a subset S of the product space Π i, X i which is countable and dense.
- The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; that's acceptable for the translation audit.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: “Show that if X is a countable product of spaces having countable dense subsets, then X has a countable dense subset.”
- Lean: Index set ι is countable. For each factor X i we assume a countable dense subset s i. Conclusion: there exists a countable dense subset S in the product Π i, X i. This is exactly the intended topological product setup and the intended conclusion, using Mathlib's standard `Dense` and `Set.Countable` on subsets and the Pi topology.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantifiers: The NL phrasing “spaces having countable dense subsets” typically means “for each i, there exists a countable dense subset of X i.” The Lean statement assumes a specific choice function s with the property (i.e., it is stated as: given such s, then ...). This is a standard way to formalize the same assumption; it is slightly stronger syntactically but implies the existential version and suffices to derive the NL statement, especially in Mathlib’s classical context where choice is available. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions; all concepts are standard Mathlib notions. The product is the Pi-type with product topology. The index set is countable. The conclusion matches exactly: existence of a countable dense subset of the product.
- No other discrepancies.

Given this minor quantifier presentation difference (fixing a choice rather than stating existence), the translation is effectively faithful to the mathematical content.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X]`: We work with a type X endowed with a metric space structure.
- `def isometry (f : X → X) : Prop := ∀ x y, dist (f x) (f y) = dist x y`: Define “isometry” for a self-map f of X as the property that it preserves distances exactly for all pairs x, y in X. This matches the given definition in the statement.
- `theorem isometry_injective {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) : Injective f := by sorry`: States that any such isometry is injective. Proof omitted, but the proposition matches a standard fact.
- `theorem isometry_surjective_of_compact {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) [CompactSpace X] : Surjective f := by sorry`: States that if X is compact and f is an isometry, then f is surjective. This is the core compactness-based surjectivity claim.
- `noncomputable def isometry_homeomorphism {f : X → X} (h : isometry f) [CompactSpace X] : X ≃ₜ X := by sorry`: Asserts that under the same hypotheses, one can construct a homeomorphism X ≃ₜ X whose underlying function is f. This encodes that f is a homeomorphism.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement defines an isometry as a distance-preserving self-map on a metric space and asks to show that if X is compact, such an f is bijective and hence a homeomorphism. The Lean code:
- Gives the same definition of isometry (distance-preserving self-map).
- States injectivity (without compactness) and surjectivity (with compactness). Together, this yields bijectivity, as requested.
- Finally packages f as a homeomorphism X ≃ₜ X, which exactly corresponds to “hence a homeomorphism.”
The code relies on the metric space’s induced topology (available from `[MetricSpace X]`) to talk about a homeomorphism, aligning with the intended meaning.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code introduces a custom `isometry` predicate rather than using mathlib’s standard `Isometry`. However, it is a faithful redefinition matching the given natural language definition for self-maps, so the meaning is the same.
- The presence of `sorry` indicates omitted proofs, but the statements themselves are correct and match the requested results. There are no vacuous or fake definitions; the only new definition is the correct predicate `isometry` and the final homeomorphism object, both aligned with the statement.
- No extra unintended hypotheses are added; `[CompactSpace X]` precisely captures “X is compact.”
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex` set up the environment and open the complex-number namespace.
- The theorem states: `theorem axler_exercise_1_2 : (((-1 : ℂ) + (Real.sqrt 3 : ℂ) * I) / (2 : ℂ)) ^ 3 = (1 : ℂ) := by sorry`
  This reads as: In the complex numbers ℂ, the number ((-1) + (sqrt(3)) * i)/2, when raised to the third power, equals 1. Here, `Real.sqrt 3` denotes the positive real square root of 3, cast into ℂ, and `I` is the imaginary unit. So the base is exactly (-1 + sqrt(3) i)/2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asks to show that (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/2 is a cube root of 1, i.e., its cube equals 1. The Lean statement asserts precisely that this complex number, raised to the power 3, equals 1 in ℂ.
- All components match: the specific complex number, the operation (cubing), and the equality to 1 in ℂ.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The expression in Lean exactly corresponds to (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/2; using `(Real.sqrt 3 : ℂ) * I` is the standard way to write sqrt(3) i in Lean.
- The target equality is exactly “= 1” in ℂ, matching the intended meaning of “cube root of 1.”
- There are no additional assumptions or missing qualifiers.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `(s t : Set X) (hs : IsClosed s) (ht : IsClosed t)`: Let s and t be subsets of X that are closed in X.

- `: MetrizableSpace X`: Conclusion: X is metrizable.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: X is a compact Hausdorff space, union of closed subspaces X1 and X2; if X1 and X2 are metrizable, then X is metrizable.
- The Lean statement precisely matches this: compact Hausdorff is `[CompactSpace X] [T2Space X]`, closed subspaces are represented by closed sets `s`, `t` in X, with the union covering X, and metrizable subspaces are `MetrizableSpace (Subtype s)` and `MetrizableSpace (Subtype t)`. The conclusion is `MetrizableSpace X`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Mathlib terminology is standard and appropriate: `T2Space` for Hausdorff, `IsClosed` for closed sets, `Subtype s` for the subspace topology, and `MetrizableSpace` for metrizability.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {K : Type*} [Field K]`: We are working over a field K.
- `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] [FiniteDimensional K V]`: V is a K-vector space (additive commutative group with a K-module structure) and is finite-dimensional over K.
- The theorem `axler_exercise_5_11 (S T : V →ₗ[K] V) (μ : K) : (∃ v : V, v ≠ 0 ∧ (S.comp T) v = μ • v) ↔ (∃ w : V, w ≠ 0 ∧ (T.comp S) w = μ • w)` states:
  For linear operators S, T on V and a scalar μ, μ is an eigenvalue of ST (there exists a nonzero v with (S ∘ T) v = μ v) if and only if μ is an eigenvalue of TS (there exists a nonzero w with (T ∘ S) w = μ w).
  This is precisely the equivalence of “μ is an eigenvalue of ST” and “μ is an eigenvalue of TS,” expressed via the existence of nonzero eigenvectors.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: “Suppose S, T ∈ L(V). Prove that ST and TS have the same eigenvalues.”
- The Lean theorem asserts for every μ, μ is an eigenvalue of ST iff μ is an eigenvalue of TS, which exactly encodes “ST and TS have the same set of eigenvalues.” It does not address multiplicities (the NL statement also does not), so that matches.
- However, the Lean statement imposes the finite-dimensional assumption `[FiniteDimensional K V]`. The NL statement as written does not state any such assumption. In general, in infinite-dimensional spaces, the standard elementary proof gives the equivalence only for nonzero eigenvalues; the case μ = 0 can differ without finite dimensionality. The Lean code circumvents this by assuming finite dimensionality, making the full equivalence (including μ = 0) valid.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Content-wise, the logical form of “same eigenvalues” is captured correctly via the equivalence for each μ.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; it leverages standard Mathlib structures and writes the eigenvalue predicate explicitly rather than using `IsEigenvalue`, which is acceptable.
- The only discrepancy is the extra hypothesis `[FiniteDimensional K V]`, which restricts the scope compared to the bare NL statement. Under a strict audit, this is a difference: the Lean statement is stronger in assumptions than the NL statement explicitly declares. If the intended context (e.g., Axler’s finite-dimensional setting) is implicit, then it’s faithful; but taking the NL statement at face value, the code adds an assumption not stated.

Conclusion: Almost a perfect translation, except for the additional finite-dimensional assumption not explicitly present in the NL statement. Hence, not fully faithful under strict criteria.

- Quantification over n is implicit in the NL statement; the Lean theorem takes arbitrary n : ℕ, which includes n = 0. For n = 0, all sums are zero, and the inequality holds trivially; this does not conflict with the NL formulation.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The mathematical content is the same inequality, with a careful reindexing from 1..n to Fin n using (i+1) as the weight. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with `sorry` as proof, which is acceptable per the instructions. There are no missing conditions or mismatched terms.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def U : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 = 0 } ∪ { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = 0 }`
  This defines U as the union of the x-axis and y-axis in ℝ^2 (here modeled as ℝ × ℝ). That is, U = {(x, y) | x = 0} ∪ {(x, y) | y = 0}.
- `theorem U_nonempty : ∃ v : ℝ × ℝ, v ∈ U := by sorry`
  States that U is nonempty.
- `theorem U_closed_under_smul (a : ℝ) {v : ℝ × ℝ} (hv : v ∈ U) : a • v ∈ U := by sorry`
  States that U is closed under scalar multiplication by any real scalar a: if v ∈ U, then a • v ∈ U.
- `theorem U_not_closed_under_add : ∃ u v : ℝ × ℝ, u ∈ U ∧ v ∈ U ∧ u + v ∉ U := by sorry`
  States that U is not closed under addition: there exist u, v ∈ U with u + v ∉ U.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL request asks for an example of a nonempty subset U of ℝ^2 that is closed under scalar multiplication but not a subspace of ℝ^2.
- The code provides U as the union of the coordinate axes, asserts nonemptiness, closure under scalar multiplication, and failure of closure under addition. Failure of closure under addition implies U is not a subspace, satisfying the “not a subspace” requirement.
- Modeling ℝ^2 as ℝ × ℝ is standard in Mathlib and faithful to the statement.

Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; U is a concrete and correct set. The theorems match the properties required. While it does not explicitly state “U is not a subspace,” it proves a stronger property (not closed under addition) that implies it, which is faithful to the intent.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem axler_exercise_5_13 {K : Type*} [Field K] {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] [FiniteDimensional K V] (T : V →ₗ[K] V)` sets up: K is a field, V is a finite-dimensional vector space over K, and T is a linear operator on V.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ (φ : V →ₗ[K] K), φ ≠ 0 → ∀ v, φ v = 0 → φ (T v) = 0` says: for every nonzero linear functional φ on V, and every v in V, if v lies in ker φ (i.e., φ v = 0), then T v also lies in ker φ (i.e., φ (T v) = 0). Equivalently, ker φ is invariant under T for all nonzero φ.
- Conclusion `∃ (c : K), T = c • (LinearMap.id : V →ₗ[K] V)` says: there exists a scalar c in K such that T equals c times the identity operator on V.
There are no auxiliary definitions; the theorem is stated directly. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumption is: every subspace of V with dimension dim V − 1 (i.e., every hyperplane) is invariant under T. In finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field, every hyperplane is the kernel of a nonzero linear functional, and conversely the kernel of any nonzero linear functional has codimension 1. Thus, “every hyperplane is invariant under T” is equivalent to “for every nonzero φ : V → K, ker φ is invariant under T,” which is exactly what the Lean hypothesis `h` expresses: `φ v = 0 → φ (T v) = 0` for all v.
- The conclusion that T is a scalar multiple of the identity is precisely stated in Lean as `∃ c, T = c • id`.
- The finite-dimensional hypothesis appears explicitly in Lean and is implicitly required by the natural language statement (otherwise dim V − 1 would not make sense in the usual sense). No extra restrictions beyond standard context are imposed.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean formulation via linear functionals is equivalent to the natural language condition about codimension-1 subspaces (hyperplanes). No additional or missing conditions are present.
- Conclusion matches exactly.
Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {R : Type _} [Semiring R]` and `variable {V : Type _} [AddCommMonoid V] [Module R V]` set up a general module V over a semiring R (not necessarily a vector space over a field). This is a standard Mathlib generality.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Axler_exercise_5_1 {ι : Type _} (T : V →ₗ[R] V) (U : ι → Submodule R V) (h : ∀ i, Submodule.map T (U i) ≤ U i) : Submodule.map T (⨆ i, U i) ≤ ⨆ i, U i := by sorry`.
  • `T : V →ₗ[R] V` is a linear operator on V (the Lean analogue of T ∈ L(V)).
  • `U : ι → Submodule R V` is a family of subspaces/submodules indexed by an arbitrary type ι.
  • `h : ∀ i, Submodule.map T (U i) ≤ U i` says each U i is invariant under T (i.e., T(U i) ⊆ U i).
  • Conclusion: `Submodule.map T (⨆ i, U i) ≤ ⨆ i, U i` says the image under T of the supremum (join) of the family U i is contained in that supremum; i.e., the supremum is invariant under T.
  • No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. `Submodule.map` is the image of a submodule under a linear map, and `⨆ i, U i` is the iSup (join) of the family of submodules, i.e., their (possibly infinite) sum.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: For a linear operator T on a vector space V, if U1, ..., Um are T-invariant subspaces, then their finite sum U1 + ... + Um is T-invariant.
- Lean theorem: For a linear operator T on a module V, if an arbitrary family (indexed by ι) of submodules is T-invariant, then their supremum iSup (which for a finite index set agrees with the finite sum) is T-invariant.
- Thus, by taking ι = Fin m and U : Fin m → Submodule R V with U i = U_i, the Lean statement implies exactly the NL statement. In Mathlib, for a finite family, the iSup over Fin m coincides with the finite sum U1 ⊔ … ⊔ Um (and for submodules the finite sup is the sum), so the formulation matches the intended meaning when specialized to the finite case.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Differences:
  • Generality: Lean allows an arbitrary index type (possibly infinite) and modules over semirings, while the NL statement speaks of finitely many subspaces in a vector space. This is a strict generalization, not a weakening.
  • Formulation uses iSup/sup rather than explicit finite sum U1 + ... + Um, but these coincide for a finite index set in Submodule.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are standard. The conclusion, when specialized to the finite case, is exactly the NL claim. The only deviation is the extra generality, which makes the Lean theorem strictly stronger than the NL statement but still faithfully captures it as a special case.
- Hence, the translation is mathematically faithful to the statement (and even more general), though not word-for-word identical.

Natural language statement: Prove that the union of two subspaces of V is a subspace of V if and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.

Lean code: The prompt says: ""Lean4 code file not found"". There is no Lean code to translate or audit.

Step 1 (line-by-line translation): Impossible; there are no lines of Lean code to interpret.

Step 2 (whole translation faithfulness): Since there is no Lean statement (no definitions, theorems, or hypotheses), there is nothing that could correspond to the given natural language statement. Therefore the translation fails.

Step 3 (final check: same or different?): They are different. The natural language states a precise iff characterization about unions of subspaces being subspaces. The Lean side provides no content at all.

Guideline checks:
- No Mathlib terms are used because there is no code.
- No auxiliary definitions (vacuous or otherwise), but also no theorem corresponding to the statement. Thus it cannot be faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib. No issue.
- The docstring states the exercise in words matching the natural statement: for nonzero integer a and n > m, gcd(a^{2^n}+1, a^{2^m}+1) is 1 or 2 depending on parity of a.
- `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_2_4 (a : ℤ) (ha : a ≠ 0) (m n : ℕ) (hn : n > m) :`: Fix an integer a with a ≠ 0, natural numbers m, n with n > m.
- The conclusion is a conjunction of two implications:
  - `(2 ∣ a → Int.gcd (a ^ (2 ^ n) + 1) (a ^ (2 ^ m) + 1) = 1)`: If a is even, then gcd(a^{2^n}+1, a^{2^m}+1) = 1.
  - `(¬ 2 ∣ a → Int.gcd (a ^ (2 ^ n) + 1) (a ^ (2 ^ m) + 1) = 2)`: If a is odd, then gcd(...) = 2.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; acceptable for translation checking.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: For nonzero integer a and n > m, the gcd of a^{2^n}+1 and a^{2^m}+1 is 1 or 2 depending on whether a is odd or even. The Lean code precisely specifies the two cases:
  - Even a (2 ∣ a) implies gcd = 1.
  - Odd a (¬ 2 ∣ a) implies gcd = 2.
- The use of `Int.gcd` and exponents `a ^ (2 ^ n)` matches the mathematical expressions. Parity is represented via divisibility by 2, which is standard.
- The hypothesis `a ≠ 0` is included as in the natural language. It is not used in the statement’s body, but that does not conflict with the original (the original also assumes nonzero).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean code is more precise by explicitly stating which parity yields which gcd value. This is consistent with the intended meaning and is a standard strengthening, not a contradiction.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. No misuse of Mathlib notions.
- Quantifiers and inequalities (n > m) match exactly.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code into natural language:
- Context and imports: Mathlib is imported and LinearMap is opened. We are working over real vector spaces.
- Theorem statement:
  - Variables/assumptions: V is a type with an additive commutative group structure and an ℝ-module structure. Additionally, V is assumed finite-dimensional over ℝ (FiniteDimensional ℝ V).
  - T : V →ₗ[ℝ] V is a real-linear operator.
  - h_no_eig: For every real λ, ker(T − λ • id) = {0}. This formalizes “T has no real eigenvalues.”
  - Claim: For every subspace W ≤ V (Submodule ℝ V), if W is invariant under T (hW: ∀ w, w ∈ W → T w ∈ W), then there exists k ∈ ℕ such that finrank ℝ W = 2*k. In other words, the (finite) dimension of W is even.
- There are no auxiliary placeholder definitions; the proof is left as sorry, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: “Suppose V is a real vector space and T ∈ L(V) has no eigenvalues. Prove that every subspace of V invariant under T has even dimension.”
- Matching points:
  - Real vector space and real-linear operator T (V →ₗ[ℝ] V) match “T ∈ L(V).”
  - “Has no eigenvalues” is expressed as ∀ λ ∈ ℝ, ker(T − λ id) = ⊥, which is equivalent in the real setting.
  - “Every subspace of V invariant under T has even dimension” matches “∀ W invariant under T, ∃ k, finrank ℝ W = 2k.”
- Potential mismatch:
  - The Lean statement explicitly assumes V is finite-dimensional (FiniteDimensional ℝ V). The natural language statement, as written, does not explicitly state finite-dimensionality. However, the phrase “even dimension” generally presumes finiteness, and the exercise is cited from Axler (which treats finite-dimensional spaces). In Lean, finrank requires finite-dimensionality; over a finite-dimensional V, all subspaces W are finite-dimensional, so the conclusion is well-typed and corresponds to “even dimension.”
  - Thus the Lean code introduces an explicit finite-dimensional assumption that is implicit or standard in the intended context. This is a minor strengthening of hypotheses relative to the bare wording but aligns with the standard meaning of the statement.

Final check:
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are standard Mathlib entities.
- The logical content matches the intended theorem (Axler 5.24). The only difference is the explicit FiniteDimensional assumption on V, which is natural and arguably necessary to make “even dimension” precise. Given the exercise context, the translation is essentially faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Deduct a small amount for making finite-dimensionality explicit when the plain statement omitted it, even though it's standard and arguably implicit. Everything else is faithful.

- The theorem statement: `theorem Ireland_Rosen_exercise_2_27a : ¬ Summable fun k : ℕ => if Squarefree (k+1) then (1 : ℝ) / (k+1) else 0 := by sorry`.
  Natural language: The series over k ∈ ℕ of the terms a_k equals the series over n = k+1 ≥ 1 of 1/n for n squarefree and 0 otherwise. Asserting `¬ Summable` means the series diverges (does not converge), over ℝ. Since terms are nonnegative, this matches the usual notion of divergence of a nonnegative series.

Assessing faithfulness:
- The target statement: “Show that ∑' 1/n, the sum being over square free integers, diverges.” Standard interpretation is the sum over positive squarefree integers n ≥ 1. The Lean statement encodes exactly this via an indicator sequence on ℕ with index shift k+1, ensuring positivity and avoiding division by zero.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. `Squarefree` is the Mathlib predicate on ℕ. The coercions to ℝ are standard and appropriate.
- Indexing starts at n = 1 (k = 0 → n = 1), which is conventional; inclusion or exclusion of finitely many initial terms does not affect divergence.
- Using `¬ Summable` for divergence is correct.

Final check:
- The mathematical content of the Lean theorem is the same as the natural language statement. No mismatches in domain (positive integers), indexing, or meaning of divergence. No red flags.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: States the exercise: For n ≥ 2, the sum 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n is not an integer.
- Theorem `ireland_rosen_exercise_1_30 {n : Nat} (hn : 2 ≤ n)`: For a natural number n with hypothesis hn: 2 ≤ n,
  `¬ ∃ m : Int, Finset.sum (Finset.Ico 2 (n + 1)) (fun k => (1 : Rat) / (k : Rat)) = (m : Rat)`.
  This asserts: There does not exist an integer m such that the sum over k in Ico 2 (n+1) of 1/k (as rationals) equals m (as a rational). Since `Finset.Ico 2 (n + 1)` is the set of integers k with 2 ≤ k < n+1, i.e., k = 2, 3, ..., n, this exactly represents the sum 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n. The statement “¬ ∃ m : Int, ... = (m : Rat)” precisely formalizes “the sum is not an integer.” No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; standard Mathlib constructs are used.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The Lean statement formalizes that the harmonic tail sum 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n is not an integer, with the usual and necessary condition n ≥ 2, and interprets the sum in the rationals (which is standard and sufficient for stating non-integrality). This matches the intended meaning.

3) Differences:
- The natural language statement as given does not explicitly state n ≥ 2. The Lean statement includes the condition 2 ≤ n. This is a minor clarification that is typically implicit, since for n = 1 the sum is empty/0, which is an integer; thus the restriction is necessary. Aside from making this explicit, the statements align.

Given there are no placeholder definitions and the statement uses proper Mathlib constructs, the translation is faithful, with only a minor explicitness difference regarding the condition n ≥ 2.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat`, `open ZMod` are standard imports/opens with no mathematical content.
- The docstring: ""/-- Show that x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution for p ≡ 1 (mod 4) iff p is of the form A^2 + 64 B^2. -/"" accurately restates the natural language claim.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_5_28 (p : ℕ) [Fact (Nat.Prime p)] (hp : p ≡ 1 [ZMOD 4]) : (∃ x : ZMod p, x ^ 4 = 2) ↔ ∃ A B : ℕ, p = A ^ 2 + 64 * B ^ 2 := by sorry`
  - Variables: `p : ℕ` with instance `[Fact (Nat.Prime p)]` means p is a prime natural number. This aligns with the conventional context of such statements (p is a prime), even if the original phrasing did not explicitly say ""prime""; in the standard exercise (Ireland–Rosen) p is indeed a prime.
  - Hypothesis `hp : p ≡ 1 [ZMOD 4]` is exactly ""p ≡ 1 (mod 4)"" using Mathlib’s congruence notation.
  - Left-hand side `(∃ x : ZMod p, x ^ 4 = 2)`: There exists an element x in Z/pZ such that x^4 equals 2 in Z/pZ; equivalently, there exists an integer solution to the congruence x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p). This is a standard faithful encoding.
  - Right-hand side `∃ A B : ℕ, p = A ^ 2 + 64 * B ^ 2`: There exist natural numbers A, B with p = A^2 + 64 B^2. Using naturals rather than integers is harmless/faithful here because squares remove sign, so existence over ℕ is equivalent to existence over ℤ.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statement asserts: For any prime p with p ≡ 1 (mod 4), the congruence x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution if and only if p can be written as A^2 + 64 B^2. This matches the natural language statement as typically understood in number theory contexts (where p is a prime). The congruence and the form A^2 + 64 B^2 are represented correctly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there are no placeholders undermining the meaning. The code uses standard Mathlib notions: ZMod, congruence `[ZMOD 4]`, and primality.
- Minor potential ambiguity in the original (whether p is prime) is resolved in the conventional way for this well-known exercise; the restriction to primes is standard and intended. The condition p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is included as a hypothesis, as in the natural statement.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically the same: Left side is x^4 ≡ 2 (mod p) solvable; right side is p of the form A^2 + 64 B^2; under the hypothesis p ≡ 1 (mod 4) and (implicitly) p prime. All details align.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem ireland_rosen_exercise_4_4 (p t : ℕ) (hp : p = 4 * t + 1) (pp : p.Prime) (a : ZMod p) : IsPrimitiveRoot a (p - 1) ↔ IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) (p - 1) := by sorry`
  This states: Let p and t be natural numbers with p = 4 t + 1, and p is prime. Let a be an element of ZMod p (integers modulo p). Then a is a primitive (p − 1)-th root of unity in ZMod p if and only if −a is a primitive (p − 1)-th root of unity in ZMod p. Since for prime p, the multiplicative group (Z/pZ)^× has order p − 1 and IsPrimitiveRoot a (p − 1) means a has multiplicative order exactly p − 1, this matches the notion of “a is a primitive root modulo p.”

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For a prime p of the form 4t + 1, show that a is a primitive root modulo p iff −a is a primitive root modulo p.
- Lean theorem hypotheses exactly encode: p is prime (pp : p.Prime) and p = 4 t + 1 (hp : p = 4 * t + 1). The variable a : ZMod p matches “a modulo p.” The conclusion uses IsPrimitiveRoot a (p − 1), which in ZMod p expresses that a has multiplicative order p − 1, i.e., a generator of (Z/pZ)^× — exactly “primitive root modulo p.” Using −a is the additive negation in ZMod p, which corresponds to the usual “−a modulo p.” The equivalence ↔ is precisely the “iff.”

3) Final check for differences or issues:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem directly states the intended result.
- The Mathlib concept IsPrimitiveRoot is the standard one for primitive roots of unity in a monoid/ring and in this finite field context is equivalent to a primitive root modulo p. No mismatch in meaning.
- Hypotheses match the p ≡ 1 (mod 4) requirement via p = 4t + 1.
- Therefore the translation is faithful.

- `theorem sin_pi_div_12_is_algebraic : IsAlgebraic ℚ (sin (pi / 12) : ℝ) := by sorry`: States the theorem that the real number `sin(pi/12)` is algebraic over the rationals, i.e., it satisfies a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. The `by sorry` is an omitted proof; we are only auditing the statement's faithfulness.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement is: ""Show that sin(π/12) is an algebraic number."" In standard mathematical usage, an ""algebraic number"" means algebraic over ℚ. The Lean statement is exactly `IsAlgebraic ℚ (sin (pi / 12) : ℝ)`, which formalizes that the real number sin(π/12) is algebraic over ℚ. This is a faithful formalization.

- Domain/codomain: `sin (pi / 12) : ℝ` matches the intended real number.
- Algebraicity over ℚ: `IsAlgebraic ℚ` matches ""algebraic number"".

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem statement: For natural numbers p and k with hp : Nat.Prime p, we consider the sum over i in (Finset.range p).erase 0 of (i : ZMod p)^k. Here, Finset.range p = {0, 1, ..., p-1}, and erase 0 removes 0, so the index set is exactly {1, 2, ..., p-1}.
- Each term (i : ZMod p)^k is i reduced modulo p and raised to the k-th power in ZMod p. The sum is taken in ZMod p.
- The right-hand side is an if-then-else: if (p - 1) ∣ k, then the sum equals −1 in ZMod p; otherwise it equals 0 in ZMod p.
- The hypothesis hp : Nat.Prime p ensures p is a prime number, aligning with the intended context.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement says: 1^k + 2^k + ... + (p−1)^k ≡ 0 (mod p) if (p−1) ∤ k, and ≡ −1 (mod p) if (p−1) ∣ k.
- Equality in ZMod p is exactly congruence modulo p. The Lean sum runs over 1..p−1 (implemented as range p erase 0), and computes the sum of k-th powers reduced modulo p. The conditional cases match: if (p−1) divides k then −1, else 0.
- The order of cases is swapped in wording (the code gives the divide case first), but the meaning is identical.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only the theorem statement. Using ZMod p is a standard and precise way to express congruence modulo p in Mathlib.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing set: {1, ..., p−1} matches exactly via (range p).erase 0.
- Modulus: expressed as equality in ZMod p—faithful.
- Divisibility condition: uses Nat divisibility (p − 1) ∣ k—faithful.
- Result values: 0 and −1 modulo p—faithful.
- Prime condition included—faithful.
- No secondary, vacuous, or misleading definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_1_19c (z : ℂ) (hz1 : Complex.abs z = 1) (hz : z ≠ 1) :` introduces a complex number z with hypotheses |z| = 1 and z ≠ 1, i.e., z lies on the unit circle but is not 1.
- `Summable fun n : ℕ => z ^ (n + 1) / ((n + 1) : ℂ)` states that the series with general term z^(n+1)/(n+1) is summable. This is exactly the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n / n, just reindexed from n = 0 by using n+1.
- The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is fine for checking translation fidelity.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: the power series ∑ z^n / n converges at every point of the unit circle except z = 1. The Lean statement asserts that for any complex z with |z| = 1 and z ≠ 1, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n / n is summable. The reindexing via `(n+1)` in Lean matches the series starting at n = 1. Using `Complex.abs z = 1` correctly encodes that z is on the unit circle. The condition `z ≠ 1` matches the exception. Summable is the correct Mathlib notion for convergence of an infinite series in ℂ. Thus, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The only small stylistic note is using `Complex.abs` rather than `‖z‖`, but it is a legitimate Mathlib function denoting the complex modulus, so no issue. The quantification over a fixed but arbitrary z with the given hypotheses is logically equivalent to the universal quantification in the natural language statement.

theorem Shakarchi_exercise_2_2 : (∫ x in Ioi (0 : ℝ), (sin x) / x ∂volume) = Real.pi / 2 := by sorry
",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_2_2 : (∫ x in Ioi (0 : ℝ), (sin x) / x ∂volume) = Real.pi / 2 := by sorry`
This asserts that the Lebesgue integral of the function x ↦ sin x / x over the set (0, ∞) with respect to the Lebesgue measure (denoted `volume`) equals π/2.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is the classical improper integral identity: ∫₀^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2, where the integral is understood as an improper integral (limit of ∫_a^b as a → 0+ and b → ∞). In standard analysis, this integral converges conditionally but not absolutely.

In the Lean statement, the expression `∫ x in Ioi (0 : ℝ), (sin x) / x ∂volume` denotes the Lebesgue integral over (0, ∞). For real-valued functions in Mathlib, the (Lebesgue) integral is only meaningful when the function is integrable (i.e., ∫ |f| < ∞); otherwise Mathlib defines the integral to be 0 by convention (`integral_undef`). The function sin x / x on (0, ∞) is not absolutely integrable, and its positive and negative parts each have infinite integral, so the Lebesgue integral does not exist in the usual sense; in Mathlib’s totalized definition, the value is 0. Thus, the code is not expressing the improper integral but rather the Lebesgue integral over an infinite measure set.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
No. The natural statement concerns the improper integral from 0 to ∞, whereas the Lean code states an equality for the Lebesgue integral over (0, ∞). These are not the same for sin x / x: the improper integral equals π/2, while the Lebesgue integral is not integrable and defaults to 0 in Mathlib’s definition. There is a substantial semantic mismatch.

Differences:
- Type of integral: improper (limit over bounded intervals) vs Lebesgue integral over an unbounded domain.
- In Mathlib, the given integral is 0 if not integrable, not π/2.
- No principal value or improper-limit construction is used in the code.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

  Natural language: For any complex number z with |z| = 1, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (n : ℂ) z^n is not summable (i.e., does not converge). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but that does not affect the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that the power series ∑ n z^n does not converge on any point of the unit circle.""
- Lean theorem asserts for any z with |z|=1, the series ∑ (n : ℂ) z^n is not summable. This is exactly the same mathematical content. The index starts at n=0 in Lean, but the n=0 term is 0, so this is equivalent.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/range: Complex numbers, unit circle condition |z|=1 — matches.
- Series: ∑ n z^n interpreted as ∑ (n : ℂ) z^n — matches standard reading of the statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement using standard Mathlib notions.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_3_4 (a : ℝ) (ha : a > 0) : ... := by sorry` declares a theorem: for a real number a with a > 0, some equality holds.
- `MeasureTheory.integral MeasureTheory.volume (fun x => x * Real.sin x / (x^2 + a^2))` denotes the Lebesgue integral over ℝ with respect to the Lebesgue measure (volume) of the function x ↦ x*sin x/(x^2 + a^2).
- `= Real.pi * Real.exp (-a)` asserts this integral equals π e^(−a).

Step 2: Does the Lean statement faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement uses the improper integral over (−∞, ∞): ∫_{−∞}^{∞} (x sin x)/(x^2 + a^2) dx = π e^{−a}, for a > 0. This is the classical Fourier-analysis/complex-analysis result of a conditionally convergent improper integral.
- The Lean code uses the Lebesgue integral over ℝ. For real-valued functions in Mathlib, `MeasureTheory.integral` is the Lebesgue integral which requires absolute integrability (i.e., ∫ |f| < ∞) to be meaningful; otherwise it is defined by default to be 0 and theorems require `Integrable f`.
- The integrand behaves like sin x / x at infinity, which is not absolutely integrable on ℝ. Hence the function is not Lebesgue integrable; the improper integral (in the sense of symmetric limits) converges, but the Lebesgue integral does not exist (and in Mathlib the `integral` of a non-integrable function is 0 by definition). Therefore the Lean statement asserts a Lebesgue integral equality that is in fact false/ill-posed for this f, rather than the intended improper integral equality.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - Type of integral: NL uses an improper integral (limit of integrals over (−R, R) as R → ∞); Lean uses the Lebesgue integral over ℝ. These are not equivalent here because the function is not absolutely integrable.
  - Consequently, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation. Aside from that, the function and the condition a > 0 match, and the right-hand side π e^{−a} is correctly represented as `Real.pi * Real.exp (-a)`.
- Conclusion: The mismatch in the notion of integral is substantial and makes the translation unfaithful.

  • `h1 : x 1 = a`: The sequence satisfies x_1 = a.

  • `hex : ∃ n, x n = 0`: There exists some index n such that x_n = 0.
- Conclusion: `∃ p : ℕ, p > 0 ∧ ∀ m, x (m + p) = x m`: There exists a positive integer period p such that for all m, x_{m+p} = x_m. In other words, the sequence is periodic.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Given a ∈ ℝ, define a sequence by x_0 = 1, x_1 = x_2 = a, and x_{n+1} = 2 x_n x_{n-1} − x_{n-2} for n ≥ 2. Prove: If x_n = 0 for some n, then the sequence is periodic.
- Lean theorem encodes exactly these initial conditions, the recurrence for all n ≥ 2, and the assumption that some term is zero. The conclusion states (using the standard definition of periodic sequence) that there exists p > 0 with x_{m+p} = x_m for all m.
- Using Nat subtraction for indices n−1, n−2 is safe since the hypothesis 2 ≤ n ensures these are well-defined nonnegative indices. The domain is ℝ as required. The periodicity definition with p > 0 and equality holding for all m matches standard usage.
- The theorem treats any sequence x satisfying the given relations rather than explicitly “defining” x via recursion, which is equivalent for the purpose of the proposition.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. All components (real sequence, initial conditions x_0=1, x_1=x_2=a, recurrence for n≥2, existence of a zero term, conclusion of periodicity with positive period) align perfectly. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. No off-by-one or indexing mismatch. The conclusion uses the standard, global notion of periodicity.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: just imports and namespace opening.
- The docstring describes the intended natural language statement.
- `theorem Shakarchi_exercise_5_1 (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf_hol : Prop) (hf_bdd : Prop) (hf_nonzero : Prop)
  (z : ℕ → ℂ) (hz_zero : ∀ n, f (z n) = 0) (hz_unit : ∀ n, Complex.abs (z n) < 1) :
  Summable (fun n => (1 : ℝ) - Complex.abs (z n)) := by sorry`
  Natural language rendering:
  Given any complex-valued function f on ℂ and three unrelated assumptions `hf_hol`, `hf_bdd`, `hf_nonzero` (each merely an arbitrary proposition, with no specific meaning enforced), and given any sequence z of complex numbers such that each z n is a zero of f and |z n| < 1, then the real series sum over n of 1 - |z n| is summable.

Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- Holomorphic-in-the-unit-disc: The code does not encode holomorphicity on the unit disc at all. It uses a placeholder `hf_hol : Prop` rather than Mathlib’s analytic/holomorphic predicates on the unit disc (e.g., `AnalyticOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1)` or analogous). Red flag: vacuous placeholder.
- Boundedness: The code uses `hf_bdd : Prop` instead of an actual boundedness condition on the image of the unit disc (e.g., `Bornology.IsBounded (f '' Metric.ball 0 1)` or a sup-norm bound). Again a vacuous placeholder.
- Not identically zero: The code uses `hf_nonzero : Prop` instead of a precise statement like `¬ (∀ z ∈ Metric.ball 0 1, f z = 0)`. Vacuous placeholder.
- Domain: The original statement is about f holomorphic on the unit disc (not necessarily defined on all of ℂ). The code takes f : ℂ → ℂ without restriction; no domain modeling.
- Zeros enumeration: The original means the sequence lists the zeros of f in the unit disc (typically all zeros with multiplicities). The code only assumes each z n is a zero with |z n| < 1, but does not require that the sequence lists all zeros, nor does it handle multiplicities. Worse, it allows arbitrary repetitions (e.g., repeating a single zero infinitely many times), which would make the series diverge, contradicting the claimed conclusion. Thus the coded statement is strictly stronger than the intended one and in fact false in general.
- Quantification: The Lean theorem is universally quantified over any sequence of zeros satisfying |z n| < 1, not an enumeration of all zeros. This is not faithful and can be false as noted.
- Use of Mathlib concepts: The code does not use Mathlib’s notions for holomorphicity, boundedness, or non-zeroness; replacing them with arbitrary Props is a major red flag per the guidelines.
- Conclusion type: `Summable (fun n => (1 : ℝ) - Complex.abs (z n))` corresponds to “∑ (1 - |z_n|) < ∞” for nonnegative terms, so that part is fine in isolation.

Final check: The math problems are different. The Lean code has vacuous hypotheses, gets the domain wrong, quantifies over arbitrary sequences of zeros (possibly with infinite repetitions), and does not ensure an enumeration of all zeros. Even if the placeholder Props were replaced by correct Mathlib predicates, the quantification over arbitrary sequences would still be unfaithful and could make the statement false. Therefore, the translation fails.

1) Line-by-line translation: There is no Lean 4 code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""). Hence, there are no lines to translate into natural language and no auxiliary definitions or theorem statements to inspect.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement: The natural language statement asserts a classical result in complex analysis: every injective entire function is affine linear f(z) = a z + b with a ≠ 0. Since no Lean code is given, there is no formal statement to compare against this claim. Therefore, the translation cannot be faithful.

3) Final check (same or different?): The original contains a precise mathematical theorem. The provided Lean side contains nothing. They are not the same; there is no formalization at all.

Additional auditor notes:
- No Mathlib concepts are invoked (e.g., Complex, holomorphic/entire, injective, affine maps), because no code exists.
- No auxiliary definitions exist, vacuous or otherwise; the absence of code itself constitutes a failure of translation.

Conclusion: The translation fails completely due to missing code.

- The theorem statement `∃! (p : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < p.1 ∧ 0 < p.2 ∧ p.1^(p.2+1) - (p.1+1)^(p.2) = 2001` reads: There exists a unique ordered pair p = (a, n) of natural numbers such that a > 0 and n > 0 and a^(n+1) - (a+1)^n = 2001.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks for unique positive integers a, n satisfying the given equation. Representing positive integers as natural numbers with strict positivity constraints (0 < p.1, 0 < p.2) is standard and faithful.
- The equation matches exactly: a^(n+1) - (a+1)^n = 2001.
- Uniqueness is expressed properly via `∃!` over the pair (a, n), which matches ""unique positive integers a, n"" as a unique pair.
- Although subtraction on ℕ is truncated in Lean, the equality to the positive number 2001 forces a^(n+1) ≥ (a+1)^n and hence coincides with the usual integer difference, so there is no mismatch here.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem cleanly states the problem without placeholders.

3) Final check:
- The Lean theorem and the natural language statement are the same mathematically. No differences found.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, standard.
- Docstring explains the problem and the chosen formalization: replace “sqrt(...) is not an integer” by “the integer is not a perfect square in Z”.
- `theorem putnam_exercise_1998_b6 (a b c : Int) :`: For arbitrary integers a, b, c.
- `∃ n : Nat, 0 < n ∧ ¬ ∃ m : Int, m * m = (n : Int) ^ 3 + a * (n : Int) ^ 2 + b * (n : Int) + c :=`: There exists a natural number n with 0 < n (i.e., a positive integer) such that there is no integer m with m^2 equal to n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c (all computed in Int; `(n : Int)` is the coercion from Nat to Int, and `^` is exponentiation by a natural exponent). This states the value is not a perfect square in the integers.
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; irrelevant to translation fidelity.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original: For any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive integer n such that sqrt(n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c) is not an integer.
- The Lean statement asserts: For any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive natural n such that the integer n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c is not a perfect square in Z.
- These are mathematically equivalent: an integer is a perfect square in Z iff its (nonnegative real) square root is an integer; if the integer is negative, it is not a perfect square and thus the sqrt is not an integer (indeed not real), which still satisfies the “not an integer” clause. The code quantifies m over Int (standard), and the existence of any integer m with m^2 equal to the value captures “being a perfect square”.
- Positivity of n is correctly encoded as `n : Nat` and `0 < n`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement. The Mathlib terms used are appropriate.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: bring in the math library and set notations; fine.
- `variable {α : Type _} [TopologicalSpace α]`: we work in an arbitrary topological space α.
- The theorem statement: `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_26 (U : Set α) : IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x, x ∈ U → x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)` reads: For any subset U of a topological space α, U is open if and only if for every point x, if x ∈ U then x is not in the closure of the complement Uᶜ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""A set U ⊂ M is open iff none of its points are limits of its complement."" In topology, for a point x ∈ U, being a limit point of Uᶜ is equivalent to x ∈ closure(Uᶜ), since x ∉ Uᶜ, so the possible subtlety between adherent points and limit points (excluding x itself) is irrelevant here. Thus the Lean condition `x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)` precisely encodes “x is not a limit point of Uᶜ” for x ∈ U.
- Therefore, the Lean equivalence `IsOpen U ↔ ∀ x ∈ U, x ∉ closure (Uᶜ)` is exactly the formalization of the stated equivalence.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement, with a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- The use of `closure (Uᶜ)` correctly captures “limit points of the complement” for points in U.
- The mathematical content and quantifiers match exactly. There are no discrepancies.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib; fine.
- The theorem statement declares: for any type `G` with a group structure `[Group G]` and finite type structure `[Fintype G]` (i.e., G is a finite group), and assuming `h : 2 ∣ Fintype.card G` (the order of G is even), there exists an element `a : G` such that `a ≠ 1` and `a = a⁻¹`.

Assessment:
- `[Group G]` corresponds to a (not necessarily abelian) group, matching the natural language.
- `[Fintype G]` and `2 ∣ Fintype.card G` precisely encode “finite group of even order.”
- The conclusion `∃ a : G, a ≠ (1 : G) ∧ a = a⁻¹` matches “there must be an element a ≠ e such that a = a^{-1}.” In Lean, the identity is denoted `1` rather than `e`, which is standard and semantically equivalent.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions focusing on the statement translation.
- The comment mentions “element of order 2,” which is logically equivalent to `a ≠ 1 ∧ a = a⁻¹` in a group, since `a = a⁻¹` implies `a^2 = 1`, and combined with `a ≠ 1` yields order exactly 2.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem faithfully captures the natural language statement with no extraneous assumptions or omissions. It matches exactly the mathematical content: in a finite group of even order, there exists a nonidentity element that is its own inverse.

- Original: ""If G is a finite group, prove that, given a ∈ G, there is a positive integer n, depending on a, such that a^n = e.""
- Lean: Assumes G is a group and finite ([Group G] and [Fintype G]), takes an arbitrary a : G, and concludes there exists n ∈ ℕ with 0 < n and a^n = 1 (identity).

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code into natural language:
- `theorem putnam_1999_b4 (f : ℝ → ℝ)` introduces a real-valued function f on the reals.
- `(h_cont : ContDiff 3 f)` means f is C^3: f has derivatives up to order 3 and the third derivative is continuous. This matches the phrase ""with a continuous third derivative"" (and is the standard formalization).
- `(h_pos   : ∀ x, f x > 0)` says f(x) > 0 for all x.

- `(h_bound : ∀ x, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≤ f x)` says f'''(x) ≤ f(x) for all x.
- Conclusion: `∀ x, deriv f x < 2 * f x` says f'(x) < 2 f(x) for all x.
There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions (`ContDiff`, `deriv`). The presence of `ContDiff 3 f` ensures differentiability so that `deriv` indeed corresponds to the classical derivatives.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The assumptions match exactly: positivity of f, f', f'', f''' for all x; and the inequality f''' ≤ f for all x; and the smoothness condition of having a continuous third derivative. Using `ContDiff 3 f` is an appropriate and standard formalization of “with a continuous third derivative.”
- The conclusion matches: f'(x) < 2 f(x) for all x.
- No extra or missing conditions; no weakening/strengthening that changes the mathematical meaning. `ContDiff 3 f` is essentially equivalent to having a continuous third derivative in this context.

3) Final check for differences:
- All quantifiers align (for all x in ℝ).
- All inequalities and strict positivity match.

  `theorem Pugh_exercise_2_32a : ∀ s : Set ℕ, @IsClopen ℕ (TopologicalSpace.induced (coe : ℕ → Real) (inferInstance : TopologicalSpace Real)) s := by sorry`
  translates to: For every subset s of ℕ, s is clopen with respect to the topology on ℕ induced by the inclusion (coercion) map `ℕ → ℝ` from the usual topology on ℝ. In other words, every subset of ℕ is both open and closed in the subspace topology coming from ℝ.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Show that every subset of ℕ is clopen."" It does not explicitly specify a topology on ℕ.
- The Lean statement explicitly uses the topology induced from ℝ via the inclusion `ℕ → ℝ`, i.e., the standard subspace topology. This is the common intended interpretation in topology texts when discussing such a fact about ℕ.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the statement is direct.

Final check and differences:
- The mathematical content matches the standard intended meaning: under the usual (subspace) topology from ℝ, every subset of ℕ is clopen.
- Minor difference: the Lean code explicitly specifies the topology (induced from ℝ), while the natural language statement leaves it implicit. This is a harmless clarification and aligns with the usual context.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: Let G be a type equipped with a group structure.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_2_3 (k : Int)`: We fix an integer k.
- `(h1 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ k = a ^ k * b ^ k)`: Hypothesis: for all a, b in G, (ab)^k = a^k b^k.
- `(h2 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ (k + 1) = a ^ (k + 1) * b ^ (k + 1))`: Hypothesis: for all a, b in G, (ab)^(k+1) = a^(k+1) b^(k+1).
- `(h3 : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ (k + 2) = a ^ (k + 2) * b ^ (k + 2))`: Hypothesis: for all a, b in G, (ab)^(k+2) = a^(k+2) b^(k+2).
- Conclusion: `∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a`: For all a, b in G, ab = ba, i.e., G is abelian.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: If in a group G, the identity (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for three consecutive integers i, then G is abelian. The Lean code assumes the existence of some integer k and that the property holds for k, k+1, and k+2 for all a, b in G, and concludes that G is abelian. This matches the intended meaning: “there exist three consecutive integers for which the law holds for all a, b.” The Lean version parametrizes the first of the three integers (k) and assumes the three identities; this is a standard and faithful formalization of “for three consecutive integers.”
- It uses integer exponents (`Int`) appropriate for the statement (allowing negative integers), and the group exponentiation in Mathlib for groups supports integer powers. The conclusion explicitly states commutativity for all elements, i.e., abelianness.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem with hypotheses and a (omitted) proof. This aligns with the instruction that proofs may be omitted but the statement must be correct.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same: The Lean theorem precisely encodes: if for some three consecutive integers (k, k+1, k+2) the equality (ab)^i = a^i b^i holds for all a, b, then G is abelian. This is mathematically equivalent to the natural language statement.
- No discrepancies in quantifiers, domains, or notions. The use of Int (integers) matches the “integers” in the statement, and the universal quantification over a, b matches “in which ... holds” for the group.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem herstein_exercise_2_2_6c {G : Type _} [Group G] (n : Int) (hn : 1 < n) (hpow : ∀ a b : G, (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n) : ∀ a b : G, (a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1 := by sorry`
  This states: Let G be a group. Let n be an integer with 1 < n. Assume that for all a, b in G, (a*b)^n = a^n * b^n (where ^ denotes group exponentiation by the integer n). Then for all a, b in G, (a * b * a^{-1} * b^{-1}) raised to the power n*(n - 1) equals 1 (the identity element in multiplicative notation).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: Let G be a group in which (ab)^n = a^n b^n for some fixed integer n > 1 and all a, b in G. Prove that for all a, b in G, (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e.
- Lean: Exactly captures a fixed integer n > 1 as a parameter with hypothesis hn : 1 < n, and the assumption hpow for all a, b. The conclusion matches: for all a, b, the commutator (a b a^{-1} b^{-1}) raised to n(n - 1) equals the identity (written as 1). Using Int for n is consistent with “integer n > 1”; and exponentiation by Int is standard in mathlib for groups (zpow), so the statement is well-formed.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for this translation check.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Identity element: e vs 1 — purely notational; in Lean's multiplicative groups, the identity is 1.
- Exponents: The statement uses integer n with n > 1; Lean uses n : Int with 1 < n, consistent. The exponent n(n-1) is represented as n * (n - 1), which is the same. Parentheses and associativity match the commutator word aba^{-1}b^{-1}.
- Hence, the mathematical content is the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The docstring states the precise exercise: Show that the series sum_{k >= 2} 1/(k (log k)^p) converges when p > 1.
- `open Real`: Open real namespace for Real.log, Real.rpow, etc.
- The theorem `pugh_exercise_3_63a (p : ℝ) (hp : 1 < p) : Summable (fun n : ℕ => if 2 ≤ n then (1 : ℝ) / ((n : ℝ) * Real.rpow (Real.log (n : ℝ)) p) else (0 : ℝ)) := by sorry` states:
  For real p with 1 < p, the series over ℕ of the sequence f(n) defined by f(n) = 1 / (n * (log n)^p) when n ≥ 2 and f(n) = 0 otherwise is summable. This is precisely the statement that the series ∑_{n=2}^∞ 1/(n (log n)^p) converges.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement is the classical result: the series ∑ 1/(k (log k)^p) converges for p > 1. Typically, to avoid log(1) = 0 and undefined terms, one states the sum from k ≥ 2. The Lean code explicitly uses the indicator via an `if 2 ≤ n then ... else 0`, which is the standard way in Lean to model the series starting at 2. This matches the intended meaning.
- The code uses Real.log (natural logarithm) and Real.rpow to interpret (log k)^p for real p; this is the correct Mathlib machinery for real exponents.
- The hypothesis `hp : 1 < p` matches “p > 1”.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement with an omitted proof (`by sorry`). This is acceptable under the instruction that proofs can be omitted as long as the statement matches.

Step 3: Final check comparing the two statements.
- Original: prove convergence of ∑ 1/k (log(k))^p when p > 1. Standard interpretation is ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k (log k)^p) converges for p > 1. The code states exactly that, using an indicator to start at k ≥ 2.
- Slight ambiguity in the original notation `1/k(\log(k))^p`: without parentheses could be misread as (1/k) * (log k)^p, which would diverge. But context and the standard result make clear it's 1/(k (log k)^p). The code aligns with the standard, and the docstring clarifies it.
- No differences in mathematical meaning: both assert convergence for p > 1 of the series with general term 1/(k (log k)^p), starting from k ≥ 2.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the intended natural language statement, using appropriate Mathlib concepts and no vacuous placeholders beyond the proof omission.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code works in a type α with a topology and assumes [CompactSpace α], i.e., the entire space α is compact.
- It fixes a sequence of sets K : ℕ → Set α.
- The theorem Pugh_exercise_2_92 assumes:
  - h_closed: for all n, K n is closed in α.
  - h_nonempty: for all n, K n is nonempty.
  - h_nested: for all n, K (n+1) ⊆ K n (nested decreasing).
  - Conclusion: the intersection over all n, ⋂ n, K n, is nonempty.
- The docstring clarifies this as the finite intersection property for compact spaces, specialized to a countable nested family of nonempty closed sets.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement says: “Give a direct proof that the nested decreasing intersection of nonempty covering compact sets is nonempty.” The wording is somewhat unclear, but the key mathematical content seems to be: for a nested decreasing family of nonempty compact sets, the intersection is nonempty. This is typically stated without requiring the ambient space to be compact; one can use compactness of each K_n and the finite intersection property.
- The Lean statement, however, assumes the ambient space α is compact and that the K_n are closed (hence compact as subsets of a compact space). This is a standard variant: nonempty closed sets in a compact space form a nested family whose intersection is nonempty. It is a special case of the more general statement about nested compact sets in an arbitrary space.
- Notably, the NL phrase includes “covering compact sets,” which is not reflected in the code. The code does not reference covers in its hypotheses; it only uses closedness, nonemptiness, and nestedness within a compact ambient space. While “direct proof using covers” pertains to the method of proof (which we ignore), the substantive mismatch is: the NL seems to refer to compact sets (possibly in a general topological space), whereas the code assumes closed sets in a compact space. The latter is strictly stronger (more restrictive) than necessary and therefore not fully faithful if the intended statement is the more general one.

Final comparison:
- Code statement: nested decreasing nonempty closed sets in a compact space have nonempty intersection.
- Likely intended statement: nested decreasing nonempty compact sets (no need for ambient compactness) have nonempty intersection.
- These are not the same: the code gives a special case requiring the whole space to be compact and closedness of K_n, whereas the original (as phrased) suggests compactness of each K_n without requiring the ambient space to be compact. Hence, the translation is close but not fully faithful.

Given the instruction to be extra harsh, the mismatch in generality and the ambiguous/unrepresented “covering” term means it does not pass as a faithful translation.

- `theorem group_of_card9_is_abelian {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 9) : ∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let G be a type with a group structure and finite cardinality. Assume the number of elements of G is 9. Then for all x, y in G, x*y = y*x, i.e., the group operation is commutative on all pairs of elements.

2) Whole-statement comparison:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian."" In standard terms, this means: If G is a group with exactly 9 elements, then the group operation is commutative.
- The Lean theorem assumes G is a group and finite (Fintype), with Fintype.card G = 9, and concludes ∀ x y, x*y = y*x. This is precisely the definition of abelian (commutative) for a group written multiplicatively.

3) Final check for differences:
- Order 9 ↔ `Fintype.card G = 9`: matches exactly.
- Must be abelian ↔ `∀ x y, x * y = y * x`: matches the definition of commutativity (abelianness) for the group operation.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. The statement does not attempt to provide an instance `[CommGroup G]` but asserting universal commutativity is logically equivalent to being abelian.
- Uses standard Mathlib structures (`Group`, `Fintype`). No red flags.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem Pugh_exercise_4_15a {a b : ℝ} (hab : a < b) (f : ℝ → ℝ) :` We fix real numbers a, b with a < b, and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- `UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b) ↔` The function f is uniformly continuous on the closed interval [a, b] if and only if

  - `(∀ s, 0 < s → 0 < μ s) ∧` for all s > 0, μ(s) > 0 (i.e., μ maps positive reals to positive reals),
  - `StrictMonoOn μ (Ioi 0) ∧` μ is strictly increasing on (0, ∞),
  - `ContinuousOn μ (Ioi 0) ∧` μ is continuous on (0, ∞),
  - `Tendsto μ (nhdsWithin 0 (Ioi 0)) (nhds 0) ∧` μ(s) → 0 as s → 0 with s in (0, ∞) (right-hand limit),

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines a modulus of continuity μ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) that is continuous, strictly increasing, and satisfies μ(s) → 0 as s → 0. The code encodes this by taking μ : ℝ → ℝ but only imposing properties on (0, ∞): positivity on s > 0, strict monotonicity on (0, ∞), continuity on (0, ∞), and the limit to 0 as s → 0 within (0, ∞). This is a standard and faithful way to formalize a function whose natural domain is (0, ∞). The codomain positivity is captured by `0 < μ s` for s > 0.
- The property “f has modulus μ” is exactly `∀ s t ∈ [a,b], |f s - f t| ≤ μ(|s - t|)`.
- The equivalence with uniform continuity is stated as `UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b) ↔ ∃ μ ...`, which is precisely “f on [a,b] is uniformly continuous iff it has a modulus of continuity.” Using `UniformContinuousOn` for a function ℝ → ℝ restricted to `[a,b]` matches the natural statement f : [a,b] → ℝ.
- The convergence `Tendsto μ (nhdsWithin 0 (Ioi 0)) (nhds 0)` correctly formalizes μ(s) → 0 as s → 0 with s > 0.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- The code assumes `a < b`. The natural language statement did not explicitly impose this (a degenerate interval [a,a] is typically allowed). This is a mild strengthening: the equivalence also holds for a = b, so the code excludes a trivial case. Being strict, this is a slight mismatch.
- The code makes μ total on ℝ and applies μ at 0 via `μ(|s - t|)` even when s = t. The original defines μ only on (0, ∞). However, since the proof is existential, one can extend any modulus on (0, ∞) to ℝ by defining, say, μ(0) = 0 (or any nonnegative value) without affecting the required properties on (0, ∞). Thus this does not change the mathematical content.
- All other components (strictly increasing on (0, ∞), continuity on (0, ∞), limit at 0 from the right, positivity for s > 0, the inequality on [a,b]) faithfully match the intended definition.

Conclusion: Aside from the minor restriction `a < b`, the statement is a faithful formalization of the theorem. No vacuous placeholders or auxiliary fake definitions are used, and Mathlib notions are standard and appropriate.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful
- Since no Lean code is present, there is no formalization of the statement: ""If σ, τ are two permutations that disturb no common element and στ = e, prove that σ = τ = e."" Hence, there is no translation to compare against the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line into natural language.
- Context: `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_3_16 {G : Type _} [Group G]` means: Let G be a group.
- Hypothesis: `(h : ∀ H : Subgroup G, H = (⊥ : Subgroup G) ∨ H = (⊤ : Subgroup G))`. This asserts that every subgroup H of G is either the trivial subgroup ⊥ (containing only the identity) or the whole group ⊤. In other words, G has no nontrivial proper subgroups; the only subgroups are ⊥ and ⊤.
- Conclusion: `∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃ g : G, Subgroup.closure (Set.singleton g) = (⊤ : Subgroup G) ∧ (Fintype G ∧ Fintype.card G = p)` means: There exists a natural number p such that p is prime, and there exists an element g in G such that the subgroup generated by g is all of G (so G is cyclic), and G is finite with cardinality p. So the conclusion is: G is cyclic of order p, with p prime.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: ""If a group G has no proper subgroups, prove that G is cyclic of order p, where p is a prime number.""
- Standard mathematical intent: Usually this means ""no proper nontrivial subgroups""; i.e., the only subgroups are {e} and G. Under that interpretation, the Lean hypothesis matches well: every subgroup is ⊥ or ⊤.
- Literal reading: ""has no proper subgroups"" means there is no subgroup strictly contained in G. But the trivial subgroup ⊥ is always a subgroup, and (for nontrivial G) it is a proper subgroup. Therefore, under the literal reading, the only group with no proper subgroup is the trivial group; the conclusion ""cyclic of order p (p prime)"" would be false. So the literal statement is inconsistent unless one inserts ""nontrivial"".
- Conclusion side: The Lean statement concludes exactly that G is cyclic and finite of prime order. That matches the intended conclusion (cyclic of order p, p prime). The use of `Subgroup.closure {g} = ⊤` correctly formalizes ""G is cyclic"" and `Fintype.card G = p` formalizes ""order p"". Including `Fintype G` asserts finiteness; this is consistent with ""order p"".

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness.
- Key discrepancy: The Lean hypothesis explicitly allows the trivial subgroup as one of the only two subgroups, i.e., ""every subgroup is ⊥ or ⊤"". The natural language phrase given says ""no proper subgroups"" (without the qualifier ""nontrivial""). These are not the same. Under the literal text, the trivial subgroup would be disallowed (unless G is trivial), which is stronger and actually impossible for nontrivial groups. The Lean version captures the standard intended hypothesis (no nontrivial proper subgroups), not the literal one.
- Additional note: Neither the NL statement nor the Lean code excludes the trivial group in the hypothesis. In the Lean version, the hypothesis holds for the trivial group (since ⊥ = ⊤), but the conclusion (prime order) fails. This logical issue highlights the importance of the ""nontrivial"" qualifier; however, this is a correctness issue, not directly a translation issue. For translation fidelity, the primary mismatch is the wording ""no proper subgroups"" vs. ""only ⊥ or ⊤"".
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the formalization of cyclic and prime order is standard. The only faithfulness issue is the hypothesis mismatch.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the literal natural language statement because the hypothesis differs: the code formalizes ""no nontrivial proper subgroups"" while the text says ""no proper subgroups"".

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

    MulEquiv G H := by sorry`
  for any types G and H equipped with group structures and finite type structures, with |G| = p*q and |H| = p*q, and with the hypotheses `¬ CommGroup G` and `¬ CommGroup H`, there exists a multiplicative equivalence `MulEquiv G H` (i.e., a group isomorphism). The proof is omitted (sorry), but we only audit the statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: If p > q are primes and q | p − 1, then any two nonabelian groups of order pq are isomorphic. Formally, for any groups G and H with |G| = pq and G, H nonabelian, there exists a group isomorphism G ≃* H.

Differences/issues:
- Nonabelian condition: The code uses `hG_nonab : ¬ CommGroup G` and `hH_nonab : ¬ CommGroup H`. This is not the right way to state ""G is nonabelian"" in Mathlib. `CommGroup G` is a typeclass asserting that the given multiplication of G is commutative and supplies a commutative group structure. Writing `¬ CommGroup G` claims there does not exist any commutative group structure on the type G at all (with the same operations), which is stronger and not the intended property. The correct assertion that the given group operation is noncommutative should be `¬ IsCommutative G (· * ·)` or equivalently `¬ ∀ a b, a * b = b * a`. So the code's nonabelian hypothesis is not faithful.
- Existence vs explicit isomorphism: The code concludes `MulEquiv G H` directly, rather than `∃ e : G ≃* H, True` or `Nonempty (G ≃* H)`. The natural language statement says ""are isomorphic,"" which is an existence claim. Requiring a specific isomorphism for every such pair (i.e., producing a canonical choice) is strictly stronger than mere existence. Thus the Lean statement is stronger than the NL statement and not logically equivalent.
- Other aspects (primes, q | p − 1, finite groups, order pq) match the NL statement.

3) Final check: The math problems are different due to two points:
- Misstatement of nonabelianness (`¬ CommGroup G` vs noncommutativity of the given group structure).
- Stronger conclusion (a specific `MulEquiv G H` rather than existence). These make the translation not faithful.

Suggested fixes:
- Replace `(hG_nonab : ¬ CommGroup G)` with `(hG_nonab : ¬ IsCommutative G (· * ·))` (and similarly for H).
- Replace the conclusion `MulEquiv G H` with `Nonempty (G ≃* H)` or `∃ e : G ≃* H, True` (or simply `∃ e : G ≃* H, True` → `∃ e : G ≃* H, True` is redundant; better `∃ e : G ≃* H, True` or directly `Nonempty (G ≃* H)`).

With these adjustments, the Lean statement would faithfully reflect the NL statement.

- The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: `Irreducible` of the polynomial `X^3 + 3X + 2` in `Polynomial ℚ` (i.e., Q[x]). No extra or missing hypotheses.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The statement domain (Q[x]) matches via `Polynomial ℚ`.
- The polynomial expression matches: `X^3 + 3*X + 2` is exactly x^3 + 3x + 2.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- NL statement: If F is a field of characteristic p ≠ 0, show that (a + b)^m = a^m + b^m, where m = p^n, for all a, b ∈ F and any positive integer n.
- Lean assumptions match: Field F, characteristic p with p ≠ 0 (`[CharP F p]` and `hp : p ≠ 0`) align with “field of characteristic p ≠ 0.” The use of `CharP F p` is standard in Mathlib and correct.
- The conclusion matches the algebraic identity and the definition of m as p^n.
- Key discrepancy: The NL statement restricts n to be a positive integer, while the Lean code allows any natural number n (including n = 0). For n = 0, the Lean statement asserts (a + b)^1 = a + b, which is true but not part of the original “positive integer n” restriction. Thus the Lean theorem is strictly stronger than the stated problem.
- No other auxiliary/vacuous definitions appear; the statement uses standard Mathlib concepts.

Final check: The two statements are not exactly the same because of the missing positivity constraint on n in the Lean code. While the Lean statement is true and stronger, under the strict auditing guidelines this is not a faithful translation.

Here `Subgroup.center K` denotes the center of a group K as a subgroup, and `(Subgroup.center G).prod (Subgroup.center H)` denotes the subgroup of G × H consisting of pairs (g, h) with g ∈ Z(G) and h ∈ Z(H).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that the center of the product of two groups is the product of their centers."" The Lean theorem asserts exactly the equality of subgroups `Subgroup.center (G × H)` and `(Subgroup.center G).prod (Subgroup.center H)`. This is a direct, standard formalization of the statement. No extraneous assumptions or weakened statements are present.

3) Final check for differences:

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_4_4_9 (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hp2 : p ≠ 2) :` 
  This asserts a theorem for a natural number p, assuming p is a prime and p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime).
- `(Finset.filter (fun a : ZMod p => a ≠ 0 ∧ IsSquare a) (Finset.univ : Finset (ZMod p))).card = (p - 1) / 2 ∧` 
  The number (cardinality) of elements a in ZMod p, among all elements (univ), that are nonzero and squares (IsSquare a), is equal to (p - 1)/2.
- `(Finset.filter (fun a : ZMod p => a ≠ 0 ∧ ¬IsSquare a) (Finset.univ : Finset (ZMod p))).card = (p - 1) / 2 := by sorry`
  Similarly, the number of nonzero elements a in ZMod p that are not squares is also (p - 1)/2.

Interpretation details:
- ZMod p (for prime p) is the finite field with p elements. Nonzero elements correspond bijectively to the integers 1, 2, ..., p−1 modulo p.
- `IsSquare a` in ZMod p means a is a quadratic residue modulo p (there exists x in ZMod p with x^2 = a). Filtering out `a ≠ 0` excludes 0, which is a square but is not included in the set {1, ..., p−1}.
- Therefore, the two counts correspond to the number of quadratic residues and nonresidues among 1, 2, ..., p−1.

Step 2: Assess if the whole Lean statement is faithful to the original.
Original statement: Show that (p−1)/2 of the numbers 1, 2, ..., p−1 are quadratic residues and (p−1)/2 are quadratic nonresidues mod p.
- The Lean statement assumes p is an odd prime (prime and ≠ 2), which matches the intended context.
- It counts nonzero elements of ZMod p satisfying IsSquare and ¬IsSquare, which is equivalent to counting residues and nonresidues among 1, ..., p−1. Both equalities are asserted explicitly.
- The integer division (p−1)/2 is valid since p is odd.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain: The NL statement uses integers 1..p−1; the Lean uses nonzero classes in ZMod p. These are in canonical bijection and yield identical counts. No substantive difference.
- Definition: Quadratic residue/nonresidue mod p corresponds to IsSquare/¬IsSquare in ZMod p for nonzero elements. No difference.
- Assumptions: The Lean code includes p ≠ 2, which is appropriate (the statement is only true for odd primes). No mismatch.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The quantification “(G : Type*) [Group G] (a b : G)” universalizes over any group and any elements, matching “in a group” or “in any group.”

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem Herstein_exercise_2_5_52 {G : Type _} [Group G] [Fintype G] (φ : G ≃* G)` declares: Let G be a finite group, and let φ be a group automorphism of G.
- Hypothesis `h : 4 * ((Fintype.elems (G)).filter fun x => φ x = x⁻¹).card > 3 * Fintype.card G` says: The number of elements x in G such that φ(x) = x^{-1} is strictly greater than three-fourths of |G|. Formally, 4 * |{x ∈ G | φ x = x^{-1}}| > 3 * |G|.
- Conclusion `(∀ y : G, φ y = y⁻¹) ∧ (∀ a b : G, a * b = b * a)` says: For all y in G, φ(y) = y^{-1}, and G is abelian (i.e., for all a, b in G, a*b = b*a).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: Let G be finite and φ an automorphism with φ(x) = x^{-1} for more than three-fourths of elements. Prove φ(y) = y^{-1} for all y, and hence G is abelian.
- The Lean statement captures exactly this: G finite group, φ an automorphism, more than 3/4 of elements satisfy φ x = x^{-1}, and concludes both that φ equals inversion everywhere and that the group is abelian.
- The inequality is correctly formalized with strict > using counts of the subset via a finset filter, which matches “more than three-fourths.”
- The conclusion about abelian is formalized as ∀ a b, a*b = b*a, which is a standard way to express abelianity without changing the typeclass; this is acceptable and faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (by `sorry`), which is allowed per instructions; only the statement needs to be faithful.
- The use of `G ≃* G` correctly encodes automorphism. The inversion `x⁻¹` is the standard group inverse. Counting via `Fintype.elems.filter ... .card` correctly models the subset of elements where φ equals inversion.
- The quantifiers and strict inequality match the phrasing “more than three-fourths.” There is no mismatch in strength or scope of hypotheses or conclusions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- The theorem:
  `theorem ring_hom_field_injective {F K : Type _} [Field F] [Field K] (f : F →+* K) : Function.Injective (f : F → K)`
  In words: For any types F and K equipped with field structures, any ring homomorphism f from F to K is injective as a function.

Step 2: Assess if it matches the natural language statement.
- Natural language: ""Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.""
- The code assumes both domain and codomain are fields and considers a ring homomorphism between them (which is the standard meaning of a field homomorphism in Mathlib). It concludes f is injective. This matches the statement precisely.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code requires the codomain K to be a field, which aligns with ""homomorphism of fields"" (both domain and codomain are fields). No extra or missing assumptions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no placeholders.
- Uses standard Mathlib structures: `Field`, `RingHom (→+*)`, `Function.Injective`.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable {F : Type*} [Field F] [Infinite F]`: Let F be a type with a field structure, and F is infinite.
- `variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]`: Let V be an F-vector space (additive commutative group with F-module structure).
- The theorem `Artin_exercise_3_7_2 (s : Finset (Submodule F V)) (h : ∀ S ∈ s, S ≠ ⊤) : ∃ v : V, ∀ S ∈ s, v ∉ S` states: For any finite set s of F-submodules of V, if every S in s is proper (S ≠ ⊤), then there exists a vector v in V that is not in any S ∈ s.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: A vector space V over an infinite field F is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.
- The Lean statement: For any finite family of proper submodules, there exists v not contained in any of them. This is exactly the negation of “the union of those submodules equals V,” hence equivalent to “V is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.”
- Using `Submodule F V` correctly models subspaces when V is a vector space over a field. Using `Finset` corresponds to “finitely many.” The condition `S ≠ ⊤` captures “proper.” The conclusion “∃ v, ∀ S ∈ s, v ∉ S” is equivalent to “the union is not all of V.”
- The global assumptions `[Field F] [Infinite F] [Module F V]` match the hypothesis “V a vector space over an infinite field F.”

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; there is a `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing. All notions are standard Mathlib concepts. The logical content is exactly the same as the natural language statement (universally quantified over finite sets of proper subspaces). No mismatch detected.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem Artin_exercise_6_4_12 (G : Type _) [Group G] [Fintype G] (h : Fintype.card G = 224) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by sorry`
  This states: For any type G equipped with a group structure and a finite type structure, if the cardinality of G is 224, then G is not a simple group.
  The docstring explicitly paraphrases: There is no simple group of order 224.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that no group of order 224 is simple."" The Lean theorem asserts: for any finite group G with |G| = 224, ¬IsSimpleGroup G. This is exactly the formalization of the natural language statement.
- The quantification is appropriate: it universally quantifies over all such groups via parameters `(G : Type _) [Group G] [Fintype G]` and the hypothesis `Fintype.card G = 224`.
- The conclusion `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` matches “is not simple.”

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of `sorry` is only in the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- The meaning of “order 224” is correctly captured by `Fintype.card G = 224`.
- Mathlib’s `IsSimpleGroup` aligns with the standard notion of a simple (nontrivial) group; since 224 ≠ 1, nontriviality is automatic, so no mismatch arises.

theorem Artin_exercise_10_4_7a (h : I + J = ⊤) : I * J = I ⊓ J := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R] (I J : Ideal R)`: We work over a type R with a commutative ring structure. I and J are ideals of R.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_10_4_7a (h : I + J = ⊤) : I * J = I ⊓ J := by sorry`: The statement: assuming the sum of ideals I and J is the top ideal (i.e., the whole ring), then the product ideal I * J equals the infimum I ⊓ J (which for ideals corresponds to their intersection).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let I, J be ideals of a ring R such that I + J = R. Prove that I J = I ∩ J.
- Ideals I, J of a ring R: matches `I J : Ideal R`.
- Condition I + J = R: in mathlib for ideals, `⊤ : Ideal R` is the whole ring ideal, so `I + J = ⊤` matches `I + J = R`.
- Conclusion IJ = I ∩ J: In mathlib, `I * J` is the product ideal, and `I ⊓ J` is the lattice infimum, which coincides with set-theoretic intersection for ideals. So the conclusion matches.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean code assumes `[CommRing R]`. Many algebra texts use “ring” to mean commutative ring with 1; moreover, the equality IJ = I ∩ J under I + J = R does require commutativity in general (otherwise one typically only gets inclusion into IJ + JI). Therefore the commutative ring assumption is appropriate and not a weakening of the standard statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard mathlib notions are used.
- The translation is precise: I+J = ⊤ corresponds to I+J = R, and I ⊓ J corresponds to I ∩ J.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  • The cardinality of G is `p * q`.
  • Conclusion: `G` is not a simple group, i.e., `¬ IsSimpleGroup G`.
  • The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for our translation audit.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that no group of order p q, where p and q are prime, is simple."" The Lean theorem universally quantifies over primes p and q and finite groups G with `|G| = p*q`, concluding `¬ IsSimpleGroup G`. This is exactly the same mathematical statement. Using `Nat.Prime` ensures p and q are primes; `[Fintype G]` and `Fintype.card G = p * q` capture ""group of order pq""; and `¬ IsSimpleGroup G` means ""not simple"".

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a single theorem statement.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., p ≠ q) are imposed; the original claim does not require them.
- The use of Mathlib's `IsSimpleGroup` is standard and appropriate.
- The Lean statement quantifies exactly what the English statement asserts, with the same meaning.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""An element x of a ring R is called nilpotent if some power of x is zero. Prove that if x is nilpotent, then 1+x is a unit in R."" Mathlib's `IsNilpotent x` matches the given definition. `IsUnit (1 + x)` precisely states “1 + x is a unit in R.” The ring typeclass `[Ring R]` supplies the necessary structure (including `1`) for talking about units.

- The natural language claim ""There are infinitely many primes congruent to -1 (modulo 4)"" is equivalent to: There are infinitely many primes p with p ≡ 3 (mod 4), since −1 ≡ 3 mod 4.
- In Lean, `p % 4 = 3` is equivalent to `p ≡ 3 [ZMOD 4]`. Requiring `∀ m, ∃ p > m, ...` encodes infinitude (unboundedness) of such primes.
- Using `Nat.Prime` is appropriate; no auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean statement asserts unboundedly many primes with `p % 4 = 3`, exactly capturing ""infinitely many primes ≡ −1 (mod 4)"". No strengthening or weakening is present. The use of `% 4 = 3` is a standard and equivalent way to express congruence to −1 modulo 4 for natural numbers.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- `open Polynomial`: Opens the Polynomial namespace so that `X` (the polynomial variable) and `C` (the constant coefficient embedding) are available unqualified.
- `theorem Artin_exercise_11_4_6c : Irreducible (X ^ 3 - C (9 : ZMod 31)) := by sorry`:
  This declares the theorem that the polynomial `X^3 - C(9)` over the coefficient ring `ZMod 31` is irreducible. Here, `X` is the indeterminate in `Polynomial (ZMod 31)`, `C (9 : ZMod 31)` is the constant polynomial with value 9 in `ZMod 31`, and `Irreducible` is the standard mathlib notion of irreducibility for polynomials. The typeclass inference fixes the coefficient ring to `ZMod 31` from the appearance of `C (9 : ZMod 31)`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement is: “Prove that x^3 − 9 is irreducible in F_{31}.” In mathlib, the finite field F_{31} is represented as `ZMod 31` (and indeed `ZMod p` is a field for prime `p` such as 31). The polynomial `x^3 − 9` in `F_{31}[x]` is exactly `X ^ 3 - C (9 : ZMod 31)` in Lean's notation for polynomials over `ZMod 31`. The theorem asserts irreducibility of this polynomial. No extra hypotheses or alterations are present. This matches the statement precisely.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Base field: F_{31} vs. `ZMod 31`: These are the same in mathlib for prime 31.
- Polynomial: `x^3 - 9` vs. `X ^ 3 - C (9 : ZMod 31)`: Identical interpretation.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there's only a theorem statement with `sorry` for the proof, which is allowed under the auditing instructions.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib standard library; fine.
- The theorem statement: `theorem zmod_mul_assoc {n : Nat} (a b c : ZMod n) : (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`
  Natural language: For any natural number n and any residue classes a, b, c in Z/nZ, multiplication is associative: (a·b)·c = a·(b·c).
  There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the body has `sorry` but the task is about translation, not proof.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original: ""Prove that the multiplication of residue class Z/nZ is associative."" This asserts associativity of multiplication in Z/nZ for a given n and arbitrary elements.
- Lean: States exactly that property for all n : Nat and all a b c : ZMod n. The slight generality including n = 0 in Mathlib still preserves truth and does not distort the meaning; it is a standard harmless generalization.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove that x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible in the field F_2. In Mathlib, `ZMod 2` is the field with two elements (canonically isomorphic to F_2), and asserting `Irreducible ((X^2 + X + 1 : Polynomial (ZMod 2)))` is exactly the statement that the polynomial x^2 + x + 1 over F_2 is irreducible.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Finset`: standard imports and namespace opening; no mathematical content change.
- The theorem statement:

  In words: For any type `K` equipped with a field structure, a finite type structure (so K is finite), and decidable equality, the product over all elements of `K` that are nonzero (i.e., filtering `Finset.univ` by `x ≠ 0`) of the function `fun x => x` (so the elements themselves) equals `-1` in `K`.

Assessment vs the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let K be a finite field. Prove that the product of the nonzero elements of K is −1.""
- Lean hypotheses: `[Field K] [Fintype K]` exactly encode ""K is a finite field""; `[DecidableEq K]` is a standard technical requirement for finite sets/finsets and does not change the math content.

- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `Field`, `Fintype`, `Finset.univ`, `Finset.filter`, `Finset.prod`.

  Natural language: For any ideal I of the ring of Gaussian integers ℤ[i], if I is nonzero (I ≠ ⊥, i.e., not the zero ideal), then there exists an integer n with n ≠ 0 such that the canonical embedding of n into ℤ[i] (written `(n : GaussianInt)`) lies in I.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: “Prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer.”
- The Lean statement asserts exactly: given any nonzero ideal I of GaussianInt, there exists a nonzero integer n whose image in GaussianInt is in I.
- The use of `I ≠ ⊥` matches “nonzero ideal.” The coercion `(n : GaussianInt)` matches “contains a nonzero integer” understood as an embedded rational integer in ℤ[i].
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof placeholder. This is acceptable for translation checking.

3) Final check: The math problems are the same. No differences in meaning or quantifiers. The statement is precise and uses standard Mathlib terms (`Ideal GaussianInt`).

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library; fine and neutral.
- `def star (a b : Int) : Int := a - b`: Defines a binary operation star on the integers Z by star(a, b) = a − b. This directly matches the specified operation.
- `theorem star_not_commutative : ∃ a b : Int, star a b ≠ star b a := by sorry`: States that there exist integers a and b such that a ⋆ b ≠ b ⋆ a. This asserts noncommutativity by exhibiting the existence of a counterexample (proof omitted, which is acceptable per instructions).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asks to prove that the operation ⋆ on Z defined by a ⋆ b = a − b is not commutative. In formal terms, this is typically expressed as ∃ a b, a ⋆ b ≠ b ⋆ a. The theorem states exactly this for Int (Lean’s integers), which corresponds to Z. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Uses `Int` which is precisely the integers Z. Matches.
- Operation: `a - b`. Matches.
- Property: Noncommutative stated as existence of a counterexample. This is the standard mathematical meaning of ""not commutative"" and is stronger than ¬∀ a b, a⋆b = b⋆a; it certainly suffices. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present. No placeholders beyond the proof itself, which is allowed by the audit rules.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the statement.
