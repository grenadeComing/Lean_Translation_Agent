/-- If X is path connected and locally simply connected, then X has a universal cover.
We express "locally simply connected" by requiring every point to have an open
neighborhood whose subtype is simply connected. The conclusion asserts the
existence of a space Y with a topology and a covering map p : Y → X such that
Y is simply connected. -/
