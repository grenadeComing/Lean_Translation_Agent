/-- van Kampen theorem (amalgamated form), stated informally: if X is path-connected and
    covered by path-connected open sets U i with path-connected pairwise intersections,
    all containing a basepoint x0, then the fundamental group π1(X, x0) is the
    amalgamation of the groups π1(U i, x0) over the π1(U i ∩ U j, x0).

    This file only states the result; the proof and the concrete construction of the
    amalgamated free product are omitted (hence `by sorry`). -/
