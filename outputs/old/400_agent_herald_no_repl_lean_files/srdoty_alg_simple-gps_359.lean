Translation of: Every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of the following groups:
  (1) A cyclic group of prime order.
  (2) An alternating group of degree at least 5.
  (3) A simple group of Lie type, including both
      (4) the classical Lie groups, namely the simple groups related to the projective
          special linear, unitary, symplectic, or orthogonal transformations over a finite field;
      (5) the exceptional and twisted groups of Lie type (including the Tits group).
  (6) One of the 26 sporadic simple groups.

This file gives a direct formal translation as a Lean statement (no proof).
Some predicates below are used as descriptive placeholders (e.g. `IsLieTypeSimpleGroup`,
`IsSporadicSimpleGroup`, `AlternatingGroup`), representing the intended mathematical
concepts; a full formal development would supply definitions or canonical representatives
for these families.
