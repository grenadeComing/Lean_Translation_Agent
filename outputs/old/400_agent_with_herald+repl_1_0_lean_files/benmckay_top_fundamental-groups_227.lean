We state the following (translated) informal theorem:
Let M and N be smooth manifolds and let f : M → N be a continuous map.
Then f is homotopic to a smooth map M → N.

This file gives a formal translation with lightweight placeholders for the
smooth manifold/smooth map/homotopy notions so the statement typechecks in Lean4.
The real Mathlib manifold predicates can replace these placeholders when available.
