# Presentation of the quaternion group

Informal statement (translated):
The quaternion group Q = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, with i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, (-1)^2 = 1,
and i,j,k multiplying as the usual quaternion units, is presented by
⟨a, b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2⟩.

This file records the translated statement. A full formal proof is omitted.
