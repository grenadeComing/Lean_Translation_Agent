Exercise: Show that the lower limit topology ℝ_l and K-topology ℝ_K are not comparable.
We write two topologies on ℝ: the lower limit (or Sorgenfrey) topology generated by
basis {[a,b) | a<b}, and the K-topology which has basis all open intervals (a,b)
and sets of the form (a,b) \ K where K = {1/n | n ∈ ℕ, n > 0}.

We assert that neither topology is finer than the other.
