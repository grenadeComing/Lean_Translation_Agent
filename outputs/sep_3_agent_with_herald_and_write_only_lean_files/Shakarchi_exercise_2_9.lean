Let Ω be a bounded open subset of ℂ, and φ : Ω → Ω a holomorphic function.
If there exists a point z0 ∈ Ω such that φ z0 = z0 and φ' z0 = 1 then φ is linear.

Remark: As stated this is a direct translation of the exercise. In classical treatments
one usually needs additional hypotheses (e.g. Ω simply connected) to conclude that
φ is the identity; here we express the conclusion as “φ is affine linear”.
