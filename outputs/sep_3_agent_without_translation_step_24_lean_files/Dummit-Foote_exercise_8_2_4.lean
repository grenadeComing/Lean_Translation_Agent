Translate: Let R be an integral domain. Prove that if the following two conditions hold then R is a Principal Ideal Domain:
(i) any two nonzero elements a and b in R have a greatest common divisor which can be written in the form r a+s b for some r, s ∈ R, and
(ii) if a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ... are nonzero elements of R such that a_{i+1} ∣ a_{i} for all i, then there is a positive integer N such that a_{n} is a unit times a_{N} for all n ≥ N.
