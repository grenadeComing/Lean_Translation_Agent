Exercise: Show that if `𝒜` is a subbasis for a topology on `X`, then the topology
generated by `𝒜` equals the intersection of all topologies on `X` that contain `𝒜`.
We state this using `TopologicalSpace.generateFrom` and the `sInf` (infimum)
over the set of topologies that make every member of `A` open.
