Exercise (Munkres 34.9). Let X be a compact Hausdorff space that is the union of the closed
subspaces X1 and X2. If X1 and X2 are metrizable, show that X is metrizable.

We formalize a slightly different but equivalent target: we show X is second countable.
Given compact Hausdorff, second countable implies metrizable, so this suffices.
