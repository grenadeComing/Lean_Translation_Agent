1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in math library definitions and lemmas.
- Comment: States the intended lemma: in any ring, left multiplication distributes over subtraction.
- `theorem mul_sub_in_ring {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry`
  This declares: For any type R with a Ring structure, and any elements a, b, c in R, we have a*(b - c) = a*b - a*c. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let R be a ring and a, b, c ∈ R. Show that a(b − c) = ab − ac.
- Lean statement: Exactly the same content: distributivity of left multiplication over subtraction in a ring.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; it directly states the desired equality under the Ring assumption.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. No discrepancies in generality (noncommutative rings are allowed in both formulations), notation matches (multiplication and subtraction in a ring), and no extra conditions are imposed.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `def approx (a b : ℝ) : Prop := ∃ k : Int, a - b = k`: This defines a binary relation approx on real numbers by: a ≈ b if and only if there exists an integer k such that a - b = k (interpreting k as a real via coercion). This matches the natural language definition “a ≈ b iff a - b ∈ ℤ”.
- `theorem approx_equivalence : Equivalence approx := by sorry`: States that approx is an equivalence relation on ℝ (reflexive, symmetric, transitive). Proof is omitted, but the statement matches the natural language goal.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The definition of the relation exactly captures “a − b ∈ ℤ”. Using `∃ k : Int, a - b = k` is the standard Lean formalization of “a − b is an integer”.
- The theorem’s statement `Equivalence approx` is precisely “approx is an equivalence relation on ℝ”.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous or missing conditions; no vacuous placeholders for the relation. The only `sorry` is for the proof, which is acceptable as we are auditing the translation of the statement, not its proof.
- No auxiliary bogus definitions. The code aligns exactly with the given statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary type `R` equipped with a `Ring` structure. For arbitrary elements `a b : R`, it claims `(-a) * (-b) = a * b`. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let R be a ring and let a,b in R. Show that (-a)(-b) = ab."" The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: a type `R` with a ring structure and elements `a b : R`, concluding `(-a) * (-b) = a * b`.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., commutativity) are added; `Ring` in Mathlib need not be commutative, and the identity holds in any ring.

3) Final check for differences:
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.
- The theorem statement matches the mathematical content precisely. The use of `*` vs juxtaposition is purely notational. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable under the auditing guidelines since we only check the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

  Natural language: For integers n, a, b, c, d with n > 0, if a is congruent to b modulo n and c is congruent to d modulo n, then a + c is congruent to b + d modulo n. Here `Int.ModEq n x y` is the mathlib predicate meaning x ≡ y (mod n). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for this audit as long as the statement matches.

- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same. The only technical difference is that the code uses integers (`Int`) throughout and explicitly assumes 0 < n, which matches “n is a fixed positive integer.” No mismatch or extra restrictions beyond the natural language statement.

- `theorem int_modeq_iff_same_remainder (n a b : Int) (hn : 0 < n) : Int.ModEq n a b ↔ Int.emod a n = Int.emod b n := by sorry`
  Natural language: For integers n, a, b with n > 0, a is congruent to b modulo n if and only if the Euclidean remainders of a and b upon division by n are equal. Here, `Int.ModEq n a b` is the standard congruence relation n ∣ (b - a), and `Int.emod a n` is the Euclidean remainder (nonnegative and less than |n|). Under `0 < n`, this matches the usual remainder upon division by n (0 ≤ r < n).

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- Original: Let n > 0 be an integer and a, b ∈ ℤ. Prove that a ≡ b (mod n) iff a and b have the same remainder upon division by n.
- Lean: Exactly the same, with the “same remainder” formalized as equality of `Int.emod` remainders. The positivity assumption matches. Congruence is formalized by `Int.ModEq`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantifiers and hypothesis (n > 0, a, b ∈ ℤ): match.
- Congruence notion: `Int.ModEq n a b` = a ≡ b (mod n): match.
- “Same remainder” is modeled by `Int.emod a n = Int.emod b n`, which for n > 0 is precisely the usual nonnegative remainder in [0, n): match.

  • Declares n as an integer with a positivity assumption `0 < n` (matching “fixed positive integer”).
  • Declares a, b, c as integers.
  • Assumes `hab : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]` and `hbc : b ≡ c [ZMOD n]`, which are the standard mathlib notations for integer congruence modulo n (`Int.ModEq n a b`).
  • Concludes `a ≡ c [ZMOD n]`, i.e., transitivity of congruence modulo n.
  • The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; per the task, we only check statement faithfulness, not proof.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The Lean statement exactly formalizes the natural language claim: with n a positive integer and a, b, c integers, `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `b ≡ c (mod n)` imply `a ≡ c (mod n)`. The additional parameter `n_pos : 0 < n` matches “fixed positive integer.” The congruence notation `[ZMOD n]` is the standard one for integers.

3) Final check for differences:
- The original statement specifies n positive; Lean includes `n_pos : 0 < n`—consistent.
- All variables are over ℤ as stated.
- The logical structure (two congruences imply a third) is identical. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. No generalization or specialization beyond the stated positivity.

There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; only theorem statements with omitted proofs, which is acceptable per the instructions.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language claim is the chain equality a(-b) = -(ab) = (-a)b. The code provides two theorems establishing each side of the chain equals -(a*b). Together, they imply the chain equality. The context (R is a ring, a,b in R) matches exactly.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
The natural language statement asserts: for any ring R and a in R, a·0 = 0 = 0·a. This is equivalent to the conjunction of two equalities: a*0 = 0 and 0*a = 0. The code provides exactly these two theorems.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same mathematical content: yes, both directions of the chained equality are explicitly given.
- Assumptions: The code uses `[Ring R]`, which is a standard ring structure in Mathlib. The statement also says “ring,” so this matches. Although the results hold in more general semirings, this slight specialization is acceptable and faithful to the usual meaning of “ring.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the placeholder `sorry` is in proofs only and does not affect the statement’s fidelity.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]: We fix an arbitrary type R equipped with a (not-necessarily commutative) ring structure.
- theorem srdoty_mul_zero (a : R) : a * 0 = 0: For any a in R, a⋅0 = 0.
- theorem srdoty_zero_mul (a : R) : 0 * a = 0: For any a in R, 0⋅a = 0.
- theorem srdoty_mul_neg (a b : R) : a * -b = -(a * b): For any a, b in R, a(−b) = −(ab).
- theorem srdoty_neg_mul (a b : R) : -a * b = -(a * b): For any a, b in R, (−a)b = −(ab).
- theorem srdoty_neg_mul_neg (a b : R) : -a * -b = a * b: For any a, b in R, (−a)(−b) = ab.
- theorem srdoty_mul_sub (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c: For any a, b, c in R, a(b−c) = ab − ac.
- theorem srdoty_neg_one_mul (a : R) : (-1 : R) * a = -a: For any a in R, (−1)a = −a.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to prove, for a ring R and a, b, c in R, the following identities: a⋅0 = 0 = 0⋅a; a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b; (−a)(−b) = ab; a(b−c) = ab−ac; and (−1)a = −a. 
- The Lean code states each of these as separate theorems. The chained equalities in the natural language are split into two theorems each (for a⋅0 = 0 and 0⋅a, and for a(−b) = −(ab) and (−a)b = −(ab)), which is an entirely faithful way to formalize the same content.
- The ambient structure [Ring R] is appropriate for all listed identities (noncommutativity is allowed, and these identities hold in any ring). No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches exactly. There are no discrepancies or unwanted specializations/generalizations.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` loads Mathlib, providing standard algebraic notions like `IsField` and `IsUnit`.
- `open Set` allows set notation conveniences; not mathematically substantive.
- Comment explains the goal: equivalence between being a field and the set of units equalling the set of nonzero elements, using `IsField` and `IsUnit`.
- `theorem isField_iff_units_eq_nonzero (R : Type _) [CommRing R] : IsField R ↔ ({x : R | IsUnit x} = {x : R | x ≠ 0}) := by sorry` states: For a type `R` with a commutative ring structure, `R` is a field if and only if the set of elements of `R` that are units coincides with the set of nonzero elements of `R`. No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted (via `sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that a commutative ring R is a field if and only if R^× = R\{0}"". Interpreting `R^×` as the set of units viewed as a subset of `R`, the Lean statement precisely matches this: `{x : R | IsUnit x}` is the set of units in `R` as elements of `R`, and `{x : R | x ≠ 0}` is `R \ {0}`. `IsField R` is Mathlib's standard predicate for ""R is a field"" for a commutative ring. Thus the theorem statement is exactly the formal version of the given statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms (`IsField`, `IsUnit`) are standard Mathlib definitions.
- No extraneous hypotheses or specializations beyond `[CommRing R]`.
- The potential set-theoretic mismatch between `R^×` (type `Units R`) and `R \ {0}` is resolved correctly by taking `{x : R | IsUnit x}` as a subset of `R`, aligning with the intended natural language reading.
- Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- theorem linear_congruence_has_solution_of_unit (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) {a b : ZMod n} (ha : IsUnit a) : ∃ x : ZMod n, a * x = b := by sorry
  Natural language: For a natural number n with 1 < n, and elements a, b in the ring ZMod n, if a is a unit in ZMod n, then there exists x in ZMod n such that a*x = b (equality in ZMod n). This equality in ZMod n is exactly the congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) when viewing a, b, x as residue classes modulo n.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: Let n > 1 be an integer. Prove that the linear congruence ax ≡ b (mod n) has a solution in Z_n whenever the class [a] ∈ Z_n is a unit.
- Lean: n is a natural with 1 < n (equivalent to n > 1 as an integer); a, b are elements of ZMod n; if a is a unit (IsUnit a), then ∃ x in ZMod n with a*x = b. This precisely asserts the existence of a solution x modulo n to ax ≡ b.
- The use of equality in ZMod n vs congruence modulo n is the standard formalization; no discrepancy.
- The hypothesis hn : 1 < n matches the natural language requirement n > 1. Using ℕ instead of ℤ for n is a benign specialization consistent with n > 1.

3) Final check of differences:
- Domain for n: ℤ in the statement vs ℕ in the code. Since the statement assumes n > 1, passing to ℕ is standard and does not change meaning for the modulus. This is acceptable.
- Everything else aligns exactly: unit condition on [a], solution x in ZMod n, equality representing the congruence.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is direct and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The Lean theorem exactly encodes this: n is an integer with 0 < n (i.e., positive), a, b, c, d are integers, with the given congruences as hypotheses, and concludes the sum and product congruences.
- Using ℤ for n along with 0 < n aligns with “positive integer.” Combining the two conclusions with ∧ is faithful to “prove both statements.” No extra assumptions are added.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib, giving access to standard algebraic structures like ZMod and IsField.
- `theorem zmod_isField_iff_prime (n : ℕ) : IsField (ZMod n) ↔ Nat.Prime n := by sorry`: For any natural number n, the ring ZMod n (integers modulo n) is a field if and only if n is prime.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: For a positive integer n, Z_n is a field iff n is prime. The Lean statement quantifies over all natural numbers n and asserts exactly the same equivalence, using standard Mathlib notions `ZMod n` for ℤ/nℤ and `IsField`/`Nat.Prime`.

The only discrepancy is the natural statement restricts to positive integers, while the Lean statement allows n = 0 as well. However, the equivalence remains true for n = 0 and n = 1: ZMod 0 ≅ ℤ is not a field and 0 is not prime; ZMod 1 is the trivial ring, not a field, and 1 is not prime. Thus the Lean version is a slight generalization that still faithfully captures the intended result.

3) Final check:
The mathematical content is the same: ZMod n is a field iff n is prime. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the Mathlib library with group theory and permutations.
- The theorem statement: `theorem subgroup_center_perm_fin_eq_bot (n : Nat) (hn : 3 ≤ n) : Subgroup.center (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) = (⊥ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) := by sorry`
  - `n : Nat` and hypothesis `hn : 3 ≤ n` means we assume a natural number n with n ≥ 3.
  - `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` denotes the symmetric group on n letters (permutations of a set with n elements).
  - `Subgroup.center (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` is the center of that group, as a subgroup.
  - `= (⊥ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)))` states that this center subgroup is equal to the bottom (trivial) subgroup, i.e., the subgroup containing only the identity element.
  - `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this does not affect the statement being expressed.

Step 2: Assess if the Lean statement matches the natural language statement.
- The natural language: ""Let n ≥ 3. Prove that the center Z(Sym_n) of the symmetric group on n letters is trivial.""
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly that for n ≥ 3, the center of the group of permutations on `Fin n` (which is Sym_n) is equal to the trivial subgroup. This is the formal way to express that the center is trivial.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The group considered is exactly Sym_n as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.
- The conclusion ""center is trivial"" is exactly captured by equality to `⊥`.
- No differences or mismatches detected.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the statement.

  • G is a type with a group structure and is finite (via `Fintype G`).
  • p is a natural number which is a prime (`Nat.Prime p`). This matches “a fixed prime p.”
  • Hypothesis h: for every g in G, there exists k : ℕ such that orderOf g = p^k. This exactly formalizes “every element has order a power of p.”
  • Hypothesis hne: G is nontrivial. This is an additional explicit assumption.
  • Conclusion: there exists r : ℕ with 1 ≤ r and |G| = p^r. This is precisely the target conclusion with r ≥ 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “If G is a finite group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime p, then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.”
- The code mirrors this with: finite group, prime p, all elements of p-power order, and conclusion that the cardinality is a p-power with exponent r ≥ 1.
- The code adds the hypothesis `Nontrivial G`. This aligns with the natural conclusion r ≥ 1: if G were trivial, |G| = 1 = p^0, which would force r = 0, contradicting r ≥ 1. Thus the nontriviality is a reasonable and typically implicit requirement given the r ≥ 1 conclusion. The code’s hypothesis thus makes the intended statement valid and does not weaken the claim; it clarifies an implicit assumption necessary for r ≥ 1.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes, effectively. The Lean statement exactly formalizes the intended mathematics, making explicit the nontriviality needed to ensure r ≥ 1. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions, and all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The quantifications and the conclusion match.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat` bring in the necessary algebraic and number-theoretic infrastructure.

- Theorem `zmod_isUnit_iff_coprime {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n) (a : ℕ) : IsUnit (a : ZMod n) ↔ Nat.Coprime a n`:
  Natural language: For a positive integer n and a natural number a, the congruence class of a in ZMod n is a unit if and only if gcd(a, n) = 1. Here `Nat.Coprime a n` means gcd(a, n) = 1. Casting `a : ℕ` to `ZMod n` corresponds to the residue class [a] in ℤ/nℤ. The hypothesis `0 < n` matches “n is a positive integer.”

- Theorem `zmod_units_eq_coprime {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n) : {a : ZMod n | IsUnit a} = { a : ZMod n | ∃ m : ℕ, a = (m : ZMod n) ∧ Nat.Coprime m n }`:
  Natural language: The set of units in ZMod n equals the set of residue classes that have some natural representative m coprime to n. This matches the description { [a] ∈ ℤ_n : gcd(a, n) = 1 }. Using an existential over `m : ℕ` is appropriate since every residue class has natural (and integer) representatives, and the coprimality condition is invariant under congruence mod n.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The original statement: For positive integer n, [a] ∈ ℤ_n is a unit iff gcd(a, n) = 1; hence the unit set equals { [a] : gcd(a, n) = 1 }.
- The Lean theorems precisely encode these facts for ZMod n, with the positivity assumption `0 < n`. The use of `Nat` instead of `Int` for representatives is harmless and standard, since each residue class has natural representatives and coprimality with n is well-defined modulo n.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; both statements are direct formalizations of the mathematical claims.

Final check:
- The two mathematical statements coincide: same domain (ZMod n with n > 0), same property (unit iff coprime), and the set equality is correctly expressed via representatives. There are no scope changes, specializations, or generalizations that alter meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  Natural language: For any additive subgroup H of the integers (ℤ, +), there exists a natural number n such that H equals the subgroup of ℤ consisting of all integer multiples of n. Here `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` denotes the additive subgroup {k * n | k ∈ ℤ} ⊆ ℤ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says the subgroups of (ℤ, +) are exactly the subgroups nℤ for integers n. The Lean statement asserts that for any subgroup H of ℤ, there exists n ∈ ℕ with H = nℤ. This is the standard classification and is equivalent to the original because nℤ = (−n)ℤ, so restricting to n ≥ 0 (or n ∈ ℕ) does not change the family of subgroups obtained. The use of `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` precisely matches the subgroup nℤ in ℤ. The direction “these are subgroups” is built into the constructor `AddSubgroup.zmultiples`, so the classification is captured.

3) Final check for differences:
- The original mentions integers n; the Lean code uses natural numbers n. This is a benign specialization since for negative n we have (−n)ℤ = nℤ, so the families coincide. No other discrepancies. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the only object is a standard Mathlib definition/theorem statement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For integers m, n ≥ 1 with gcd(m, n) = 1, Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}.
- The Lean code asserts exactly an additive group isomorphism between ZMod m × ZMod n and ZMod (m * n) under the conditions m, n ≥ 1 and coprime. Since Z_m typically denotes the cyclic group of order m (the additive group of integers mod m), this matches the intended meaning as a group isomorphism.
- Using `ℕ` with `1 ≤ m, 1 ≤ n` instead of integers ≥ 1 is a benign specialization; it matches the positivity constraint and does not change the content.
- The isomorphism is given as `≃+` (additive group isomorphism), which aligns with the group-theoretic statement. An equivalence is symmetric, so the direction written is immaterial.
- There are no auxiliary fake definitions; the only placeholder is the omitted proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for checking statement faithfulness per the task.

Final check:
- The Lean statement and the natural language statement are the same in mathematical content: both assert an isomorphism of additive groups between Z_m × Z_n and Z_{mn} under coprimality and m, n ≥ 1. No discrepancies beyond the harmless specialization to natural numbers.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- The module docstring states the classification theorem and the counting result, but comments are non-binding.
- `open Finset`: Opens Finset namespace; not used.

First theorem:
`theorem finite_abelian_group_decomposition (G : Type*) [AddCommGroup G] [Fintype G] :
  Exists (fun (k : ℕ) => Exists (fun (n : Fin k → ℕ) => (∀ i, 0 < n i) ∧ Nonempty (G ≃+ (∀ i, ZMod (n i)))) ) := by sorry`
- Natural language translation: For any finite abelian group G (an additive commutative group with finitely many elements), there exists a natural number k and a function n from `Fin k` to positive natural numbers such that G is additively isomorphic to the finite direct product of cyclic groups `ZMod (n i)` over i in `Fin k`.
- This asserts existence of a decomposition into a finite product of cyclic groups (ZMod n are cyclic of order n). It does not impose the invariant factors condition or prime power condition, but the first sentence of the natural language statement only claims existence of a direct product of cyclic groups, so this part is broadly faithful to that sentence. The proof is `sorry`, but we are auditing statements, not proofs.

Second theorem:
`/-- Count of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n equals product of partition numbers -/
 theorem count_iso_classes_of_order (n : ℕ) :
  1 = 1 := by
  -- placeholder: full statement requires substantial Mathlib setup; we place a stub.
  sorry`
- Natural language translation: For any natural number n, 1 = 1. This is a trivial identity and does not encode any part of the stated counting theorem.
- This is explicitly a placeholder and entirely fails to formalize: “If n = p1^k1 ⋯ pr^kr, then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n is p(k1)⋯p(kr).” There is no mention of prime factorization, partitions, or counting isomorphism classes.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The first sentence of the natural language statement is decently captured by the first theorem’s type: G is isomorphic to a finite product of cyclic groups. Using `∀ i, ZMod (n i)` as the product is standard for direct product over a finite index. The positivity condition `0 < n i` ensures nontrivial cyclic factors (although allowing k = 0 accommodates the trivial group, which is acceptable). No vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The second sentence (the counting result p(k1)…p(kr)) is not formalized at all; instead, a completely unrelated stub `1 = 1` is given. This is not a faithful translation.

Final comparison:
- The code captures only the first part (existence of a decomposition into cyclic factors), and even then in a weaker non-canonical form (no invariant factors or primary decomposition constraints, though that’s acceptable for the first sentence). The second, crucial counting statement is entirely missing and replaced by a trivial tautology.
- Therefore, the overall translation is not faithful to the full natural language statement.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions, but one of the two main claims is replaced by an unrelated tautology. The partial match for the first sentence prevents a bottom score, but the failure to encode the counting theorem is substantial.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is parameterized by a type R and two binary operations add mul : R → R → R.
- The statement asserts an equivalence:
  Left side: Nonempty (Ring R), i.e., there exists a ring structure on R (in the typeclass sense).
  Right side: (Nonempty (AddCommGroup R) ∧ Nonempty (Monoid R) ∧ distributivity for the explicit functions add and mul). Concretely, the distributive laws are stated as ∀ a b c, mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c) and mul (add b c) a = add (mul b a) (mul c a).
- Importantly, the Nonempty (Ring R), Nonempty (AddCommGroup R), and Nonempty (Monoid R) are completely independent typeclass instances on R; they are not tied to the explicit function parameters add and mul. The distributivity is stated with the explicit add and mul, but the group/monoid/ring structures referenced in Nonempty(...) could use entirely different operations.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is about a set R equipped with two specific binary operations + and ·, and says: R is a ring (with those operations) if and only if (R,+) is an abelian group with identity 0, (R,·) is a monoid with identity 1, and both distributive laws hold for those same + and ·.
- The Lean statement, however, does not link the provided add and mul with the operations of the ring/additive group/monoid instances on R. It only requires existence of some Ring R and some AddCommGroup R and some Monoid R, while the distributivity is enforced for the externally given add, mul, which could be unrelated to the operations used by those instances. Thus, the equivalence in the code is not the same as the intended one.
- On the positive side, using AddCommGroup and Monoid does correctly encode the identities 0 and 1 and the required axioms, but this is undermined by the lack of identification with the given operations.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The key mismatch is that the theorem introduces explicit binary operations add and mul but never connects them to the Ring/AddCommGroup/Monoid structures whose existence it quantifies. The original statement requires that the same operations + and · are used throughout. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.

Additional notes:
- The omission of proofs (by sorry) is acceptable under the given instructions. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The issue is the structural mismatch linking operations to instances.

- theorem perm_isConj_iff_cycleType_eq (n : ℕ) (σ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : IsConj σ τ ↔ σ.cycleType = τ.cycleType
  Natural language: For σ, τ ∈ S_n (represented as permutations of Fin n), σ and τ are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type. This matches the first sentence of the statement.

- def conj_classes_equiv_partitions (n : ℕ) : ConjClasses (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ≃ { m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }
  Natural language: There is a bijection between conjugacy classes of S_n and the subtype of multisets of natural numbers whose sum is n. However, this identifies “partitions of n” with all multisets of natural numbers summing to n, without requiring all parts be positive. In particular, multisets may contain zeros, e.g. {0}, {0,0}, etc., which still sum to n if n = 0 and even if n > 0, you can add arbitrarily many 0's without changing the sum. Thus this target is strictly larger than the set of partitions (which are multisets of positive integers summing to n). This is a mismatch.

- theorem num_conj_classes_eq_num_partitions (n : ℕ) : Nat.card (ConjClasses (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) = Nat.card { m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n }
  Natural language: The number of conjugacy classes of S_n equals the number of multisets of natural numbers whose sum is n. This again deviates from the intended “number of partitions of n” because of the missing positivity constraint. Moreover, allowing zeros means the set on the right is infinite (you can add any number of zeros without changing the sum), whereas the number of conjugacy classes is finite. So this statement does not reflect the intended finiteness and equality to the partition number p(n).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The first theorem is faithful: it exactly states that conjugacy iff same cycle type in S_n.
- The second and third claims are not faithful: the Lean code uses { m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n } as a stand-in for partitions of n. True partitions require all parts to be positive. The code omits this crucial positivity condition, so it vastly enlarges the set (indeed to an infinite set), breaking the intended correspondence and counting statement.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The first part matches, but the subsequent two do not. The correct target should be something like { m : Multiset ℕ // m.sum = n ∧ ∀ a ∈ m, 0 < a } (or a dedicated partition type in Mathlib), ensuring parts are positive. Without this, the claimed bijection and the cardinality equality are wrong.

For any positive integer n, if A is an n×n matrix and B is the matrix obtained from A by performing
a single elementary row operation, then B = U * A, where U is the corresponding elementary
n×n elementary matrix of the same type.

We formalize this statement by introducing two abstract predicates:
- `obtained_by_single_row_op A B` meaning B is obtained from A by a single elementary row op,
- `elementary_matrix U` meaning U is an elementary matrix.

The theorem then asserts existence of such a U with B = U ⬝ A. The proof is omitted (:= by sorry).

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code works over a semiring R and considers n×n matrices indexed by Fin n, matching the setting of matrices over a ring/semiring.
- It introduces two predicates:
  - obtained_by_single_row_op A B : Prop := True. This is a placeholder meaning “B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation,” but it is defined as True, so it is vacuous and imposes no actual condition.
  - elementary_matrix U : Prop := True. This is a placeholder meaning “U is an elementary matrix,” but again it is vacuously True.
- The theorem single_row_op_left_mul states: for n > 0, if obtained_by_single_row_op A B, then there exists U such that elementary_matrix U and B = U * A. This mirrors the intended shape of the statement: B = U A for some elementary U, with the size and left-multiplication correct. However, the proof is omitted (by sorry), and more importantly the key predicates are vacuous.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: for any positive integer n, if B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, then B = UA where U is the corresponding elementary matrix of the same type (row swap, scaling, or row addition).
- The theorem’s logical structure largely matches the intended claim: given a single row operation producing B from A, there exists an elementary U with B = U * A.
- However, two serious issues:
  1) The auxiliary predicates are vacuous (defined := True), so the code does not genuinely encode the notions “obtained by a single elementary row operation” or “elementary matrix.” This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and not placeholders.
  2) The statement does not capture the “same type”/“corresponding” nuance linking the specific row operation used to obtain B from A with the type of elementary matrix U. Even if the predicates were made non-vacuous, as written the theorem only asserts existence of some elementary matrix U, not necessarily of the same type as the operation used. This is a slight weakening of the natural language statement.

Final comparison:
- While the overall structure (n > 0, B = U * A for an elementary U) is close, the use of vacuous predicates means the code does not faithfully formalize the content. Additionally, the “same type” correspondence is not encoded. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Because the auxiliary definitions are vacuous, the translation fails. If those predicates were replaced by faithful definitions, the theorem would be close to the intended statement but still slightly weaker due to the missing “same type” requirement. Hence a score around 6 is appropriate.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Function`: Bring in Mathlib and open a namespace; these are incidental.
- The docstring states the goal: For a ring R and a ∈ R, show (-1) a = -a.
- `theorem neg_one_mul_extracted [MulOneClass R] [HasDistribNeg R] (a : R) : -1 * a = -a := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R equipped with a multiplication and multiplicative identity (MulOneClass) and a negation operation that distributes over multiplication (HasDistribNeg), and for any element a in R, we have (-1) * a = -a. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: Let R be a ring and a ∈ R. Show (-1)a = -a.
- The Lean theorem asserts exactly the equality (-1) * a = -a, with assumptions that are weaker than a ring: only a multiplicative structure with 1 and a negation distributing over multiplication are required. This is a valid generalization; in particular, any ring satisfies these assumptions, and the claim is true in that context.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement directly matches the mathematical claim.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Difference: The code assumes weaker structures ([MulOneClass R] and [HasDistribNeg R]) rather than a full ring. This is a slight generalization, not a restriction or a change in meaning of the target equality. This is acceptable per the guidelines.
- The equality itself is precisely the same as in the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully (indeed, slightly more generally) formalizes the natural language claim. No vacuous placeholders are used apart from an omitted proof, which is allowed. Therefore, it passes.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib’s standard library, so all notions (Sylow, normalizer) are legitimate.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{G : Type*} [Group G]`: G is a group.
  - `{p : ℕ} [Fact (Nat.Prime p)]`: p is a prime number (expressed via a typeclass `Fact (Nat.Prime p)`).
  - `[Unique (Sylow p G)]`: There is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup of G (existence and uniqueness bundled into a `Unique` instance for the type of Sylow p-subgroups).
  - Conclusion: `Subgroup.normalizer ((default : Sylow p G) : Subgroup G) = (⊤ : Subgroup G)`: The normalizer of the unique Sylow p-subgroup (picked as `default` via `Unique`) is the whole group. This is equivalent to saying that this Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let p be a prime. If G is a finite group with exactly one Sylow p-subgroup, then that Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.”
- Lean:
  - Prime p: matched by `[Fact (Nat.Prime p)]`.
  - Finite group: In Mathlib, the type `Sylow p G` is only meaningful in the finite setting (it typically requires a finiteness instance such as `[Fintype G]` or `[Finite G]` as an implicit typeclass parameter). Even if not made explicit, it is implicitly required by the presence of `Sylow p G`. If, in some versions, `Sylow p G` were defined more generally, the statement would be a slight generalization (still correct), which is acceptable per the guidelines.
  - “Exactly one Sylow p-subgroup”: precisely captured by `[Unique (Sylow p G)]`.
  - “That Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G”: equivalently expressed by `Subgroup.normalizer H = ⊤`. In group theory and in Mathlib, `N_G(H) = ⊤` is equivalent to H being normal in G.

Potential minor discrepancies:
- The docstring text says “equals its normalizer, i.e. is normal” but the theorem actually asserts “normalizer = ⊤”. The theorem statement is the correct formalization for normality; the docstring wording is slightly off, but the code’s statement matches the intended mathematics.
- The explicit finiteness hypothesis is not written but is implicit via the `Sylow` type; even if it were a slight generalization, it remains faithful to the intended statement.

Final check:
- The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language claim, with standard Mathlib notions and no vacuous placeholders.
- No auxiliary fake definitions; the only omitted part is the proof (`by sorry`), which is allowed for this task.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We fix a finite group G and a natural number p with a group structure [Group G] and finiteness [Fintype G].
- Hypotheses: hp : p.Prime (p is prime), hp_ne_two : p ≠ 2 (so p is odd), and hcard : Fintype.card G = 2 * p (|G| = 2p).
- Conclusion (disjunction):
  • Nonempty (G ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod (2 * p))) — meaning G is isomorphic, as a multiplicative group, to the additive cyclic group ZMod (2p); i.e., G ≅ Z_{2p}.
  • Or there exists a homomorphism φ : Multiplicative (ZMod 2) →* MulAut (Multiplicative (ZMod p)) such that Nonempty (G ≃* SemidirectProduct (Multiplicative (ZMod p)) (Multiplicative (ZMod 2)) φ). This states G is isomorphic to a semidirect product Z_p ⋊_φ Z_2 for some action φ of Z_2 on Z_p.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural statement:
- The first alternative matches exactly “G is isomorphic to Z_{2p}”. Using Multiplicative (ZMod (2p)) is the standard Mathlib way to express the cyclic group of order 2p as a multiplicative group.
- The second alternative expresses that G is a semidirect product Z_p ⋊ Z_2 for some action. For p odd, homomorphisms Z_2 → Aut(Z_p) are either trivial or the unique nontrivial one (inversion). The nontrivial action yields the dihedral group of order 2p. Thus, “∃ φ, G ≃ Z_p ⋊_φ Z_2” covers the dihedral case (and also the trivial action, which corresponds to the cyclic case already covered by the first alternative). Hence, the two possibilities in the code are exactly the two classifications: cyclic of order 2p or dihedral of order 2p.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language statement says “either Z_{2p} or D_p.” The code says “either Z_{2p} or a semidirect product Z_p ⋊ Z_2 for some action φ.” For odd p, the only nontrivial action is inversion, yielding D_p. The trivial action yields the cyclic case, which is already listed separately. Therefore, the code is an equivalent and standard formalization of the same classification, possibly slightly more general in phrasing but not in substance. No vacuous definitions or placeholders are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions. The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Nat}`: We fix a natural number n to index n×n matrices.
- `def is_elementary_matrix (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real) : Prop := True`: This introduces a predicate intended to mean “M is an elementary matrix,” but it is defined as True for all matrices. This is a vacuous placeholder, not a genuine definition (it imposes no restriction).
- The theorem `nonsingular_matrix_is_product_of_elementary_matrices` states: For any real n×n matrix A with det A ≠ 0, there exists a list E of real n×n matrices such that (1) every M in E satisfies `is_elementary_matrix M`, and (2) the product of the list E is A. Given the placeholder, condition (1) is automatically true for every matrix M.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Any nonsingular n×n real matrix A can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.” This requires a genuine notion of “elementary matrix” (row swaps, nonzero row scalings, and row additions) and asserts that A equals a finite product of such matrices. The hypothesis “nonsingular” matches `A.det ≠ 0` over ℝ, and the conclusion matches existence of a finite list whose product is A, with each factor elementary.
- Lean code: The conclusion attempts to assert exactly that, but the key predicate `is_elementary_matrix` is defined as `True`, i.e., every matrix is deemed elementary. Thus the statement collapses to: there exists a list of matrices whose product is A (for example, the singleton list [A]), with no real restriction on factors. This is not faithful to the intended meaning.

Final check:
- The core discrepancy is the vacuous placeholder definition of elementary matrices. Because of this, the theorem as stated does not express the intended mathematical content. There are no other problematic auxiliary definitions, and the structure (finite product via a list, Real matrices, invertibility via det ≠ 0) otherwise matches the natural language statement. If `is_elementary_matrix` were properly defined, the theorem would be faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to a vacuous auxiliary definition.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat`: setup, no mathematical content change.
- Docstring: States the classical classification: the unit group `(ZMod n)ˣ` is cyclic iff `n = 2, 4, p^t, 2 p^t` for an odd prime `p` and `t ≥ 1`. This matches the natural language statement (with the explicit `t ≥ 1`).
- Theorem statement: `theorem zmod_units_cyclic_iff {n : ℕ} : IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ) ↔ n = 2 ∨ n = 4 ∨ ∃ (p t : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ (n = p ^ t ∨ n = 2 * p ^ t)`.
  • Left side: `IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ)` means the unit group modulo `n` is cyclic, i.e., there exists a primitive root modulo `n` (a generator). This matches the natural language “There is a primitive root in Z_n^×”.
  • Right side: A disjunction covering `n = 2`, `n = 4`, or `n` is `p^t` or `2 p^t` for some prime `p` with `p ≠ 2` (i.e., `p` odd) and natural `t`.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Correct encodings:
  • “Primitive root exists” ⇔ “unit group is cyclic” is accurate.
  • “p odd prime” ⇔ `Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2` is accurate.
  • Inclusion of `n = 2` and `n = 4` is correct.
  • Inclusion of the cases `n = p^t` or `n = 2 p^t` is correct in form.

Differences / issues:
- Missing constraint `t ≥ 1`: The Lean statement quantifies `t : ℕ` with no lower bound. This allows `t = 0`, which introduces extra cases:
  • `n = p^0 = 1`, so `n = 1` is included on the RHS though not listed in the original statement.
  • `n = 2 * p^0 = 2`, duplicating the explicit `n = 2` case (harmless but shows the missing constraint).
- No restriction `n ≥ 1`: The Lean theorem is stated for all `n : ℕ`. The classical statement is about positive moduli; the natural language implicitly assumes `n ≥ 1`. Including `n = 0` in the Lean statement is a generalization the natural language did not make. Whether or not it is true for `n = 0` is beside the point; as a translation, this is an extra case not present in the original statement.
- The docstring mentions `t ≥ 1`, but the theorem statement does not enforce it; thus the code does not fully match even its own docstring.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is a near miss: it correctly captures the structure and all intended cases but omits the `t ≥ 1` constraint and does not restrict to `n ≥ 1`, thereby admitting `n = 1` (via `t = 0`) and considering `n = 0`. Hence it is an almost-faithful translation with small but real discrepancies.

In other words, an infinite cyclic group G is isomorphic to ℤ as a group.

  Natural language: For any type G with a group structure, if G is cyclic and finite, there exists a positive integer n and a group isomorphism (as a multiplicative group) between G and the multiplicative incarnation of ZMod n (i.e., the additive group of integers modulo n). In other words, a finite cyclic group is isomorphic to ℤ_n for some n > 0.

2) Faithfulness to the original statements:
- First statement: “Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ.” The code assumes [Group G], [IsCyclic G], and Infinite G, and concludes existence of a group isomorphism to Multiplicative ℤ. Using Multiplicative ℤ is the standard way in Lean to view the additive group ℤ as a multiplicative group. This matches the mathematics exactly.
- Second statement: “Any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ_n for some positive integer n.” The code assumes [Group G], [IsCyclic G], and [Fintype G], and concludes ∃ n > 0 with a group isomorphism to Multiplicative (ZMod n). ZMod n is the integers modulo n (with additive group structure), and the Multiplicative wrapper changes notation to multiplicative, matching the group setting. The constraint 0 < n matches “positive integer n.”

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorems are faithful translations. They use standard mathlib notions (Group, IsCyclic, Infinite, Fintype, ZMod, Multiplicative, MulEquiv), and they assert existence of the corresponding group isomorphisms. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The only difference is notational (additive vs multiplicative), handled via Multiplicative, which preserves the mathematical content.

- `theorem test_true : True := by trivial`: State and prove a trivial theorem that `True` holds.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement involves an orthogonal matrix `A ∈ O(n)`, written in terms of its column vectors `A = [A1 | A2 | ... | An]` with `Ai ∈ R^n`, and asks to “Prove the following” (though the target claim is not specified). Even with the target omitted, the context clearly concerns real matrices, the orthogonal group, and column vectors. The Lean code makes no mention of real numbers, matrices, the orthogonal group `O(n)`, columns, or any related structures. It merely sets up an arbitrary finite type and proves `True`. Thus it is completely unrelated to the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

The two problems are entirely different. The Lean code does not attempt to formalize anything about `O(n)` or matrices. There are no auxiliary definitions that are placeholders; instead, there is simply no relevant content. Hence the translation fails.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem subgroup_fixing_point_subset_of_normal {n : ℕ} (N : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n))) [N.Normal] (i : Fin n) (hN : N ≤ alternatingGroup (Fin n)) : ... := by sorry`
  Translation: For any natural number n, let N be a subgroup of the symmetric group S_n = Perm (Fin n), assumed normal in S_n (the `[N.Normal]` typeclass). Fix i ∈ Fin n. Assume further that N is contained in the alternating group A_n (the hypothesis `hN : N ≤ alternatingGroup (Fin n)`). The goal is to prove that `(Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n))) ⊆ N`.

- The left-hand side `(Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n)))` purports to be some subset/subgroup of `Perm (Fin n)`. However, as written, it coerces `i : Fin n` to a permutation `(i : Perm (Fin n))`, which does not make mathematical sense for a point i. Moreover, the intended subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n | σ(i) = i} is the point stabilizer at i. In mathlib, this should look like `Equiv.Perm.stabilizer i` (a Subgroup) or via the action-theory `Subgroup.stabilizer` for the action of `Perm (Fin n)` on `Fin n`. The expression `Perm.fixedByPerm` suggests a set of permutations fixed by a permutation (a centralizer-like object under conjugation), not the stabilizer of a point. So the object on the left is not the point-fixing subgroup.

- The relation used is `⊆`, which is subset of sets, not the lattice order `≤` between subgroups. If the left-hand side were a Subgroup, the correct relation would be `≤`. If it is a Set, then it is anyway the wrong object (not the point stabilizer subgroup G_i).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language assumptions: n ≥ 6; N is a proper normal subgroup of A_n; i ∈ {1, ..., n}. Goal: Show N contains G_i = {σ ∈ A_n | σ(i)=i}.
- Lean assumptions: No constraint n ≥ 6; N is normal in S_n (stronger than normal in A_n, but different); N is contained in A_n (ok as a way to say N ≤ A_n, but normality is with respect to S_n, not A_n); no assumption that N is proper. 
- Goal in Lean: Inclusion of an ill-defined object `(Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n)))` into N. This is not the subgroup of permutations fixing i. Even ignoring that, the relation symbol is wrong for subgroups.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. Major discrepancies:
  - Missing hypothesis n ≥ 6.
  - Missing hypothesis that N is proper.
  - Normality is taken in S_n rather than in A_n.
  - The subgroup G_i is not correctly represented; instead an unrelated (and likely ill-typed) object `Perm.fixedByPerm (i : Perm (Fin n))` appears, coercing a point to a permutation.
  - Uses `⊆` rather than `≤` for subgroups.

Because of these issues, the Lean statement is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `def GL_set (n : ℕ) : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := { A | IsUnit A }`: Define GL(n) as the set of real n×n matrices that are units (i.e., invertible matrices). This matches the usual notion of GL(n).
- `theorem O_eq_GL_set_inter (n : ℕ) : O n = { A | A ∈ GL_set n ∧ A * Aᵀ = 1 } := by sorry`: States the theorem that the set O(n), as defined above by the orthogonality condition A Aᵀ = I, equals the set of matrices that are both invertible and satisfy A Aᵀ = I; i.e., O(n) = {A in GL(n) : A Aᵀ = I}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Prove that O(n) = {A in GL(n) : A A^T = I}. The Lean code defines O(n) via the orthogonality equation and GL(n) via invertibility and then states exactly the equality O(n) = {A ∈ GL(n) ∧ A Aᵀ = 1}. This is a faithful formalization of the claim to be proved. The use of IsUnit for invertibility and `1` for the identity matrix is standard in Mathlib. Over ℝ, transpose is the right operation (conjugate transpose coincides with transpose), so Aᵀ is appropriate.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain and field: Code uses real matrices of size n×n, matching the usual O(n) over ℝ.
- Condition: `A * Aᵀ = 1` matches `A A^T = I`.
- GL(n): Implemented as `IsUnit` for matrices, which is the standard Mathlib notion of invertibility.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; both O and GL_set are meaningful, and the theorem states the intended equality. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the task is about translation, not proof.
There are no substantive differences; the formal statement matches the natural language claim.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We work with an index type `n` that is a finite type with decidable equality. Matrices are `n × n` real matrices indexed by `n`.
- `def SL : Set (Matrix n n Real) := { A | Matrix.det A = 1 }`: Defines the subset SL of `n × n` real matrices consisting of those with determinant equal to 1. This matches the set-theoretic definition of SL(n, R).
- `noncomputable def SL_group : Group ({ A : Matrix n n Real // Matrix.det A = 1 }) := by sorry`: Attempts to define a group structure on the subtype of matrices with determinant 1. However, the definition is left as `sorry`, meaning the group operations and axioms are not actually provided. Moreover, it does not explicitly specify that the group operation is matrix multiplication, which the natural language statement requires.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the original statement?
- The natural language statement: “Show that SL(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(R) : det A = 1} is a group under matrix multiplication.” This asks to endow the set with the group structure induced by matrix multiplication and inversion (i.e., closure under multiplication and inverse, identity is the identity matrix).
- The Lean code defines the set correctly, but then gives a vacuous placeholder for the group structure (`by sorry`). It neither constructs the group structure nor ties it to matrix multiplication. Therefore, it fails to actually state (let alone demonstrate) that the operation is matrix multiplication. The use of `sorry` is a vacuous placeholder per the guidelines, so this fails the faithfulness criterion.
- There is a mild generalization: the index `n` is any finite type rather than a natural number, which is acceptable as a standard formalization detail.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - The Lean code does not specify that the group operation is matrix multiplication; it only asserts (vacuously) that there is some `Group` structure on the subtype.
  - The construction is left as `sorry`, so the group structure is not legitimately provided.
- Because of the vacuous `sorry` and the lack of explicit linkage to matrix multiplication, the Lean code is not a faithful translation, even though the set SL is correctly defined and the intended target type is appropriate.

Given these issues, the translation fails. If the `sorry` were replaced by an actual construction using matrix multiplication and inverse (and proofs that det=1 is preserved under these operations), it would be faithful. As-is, it merits a mid-level score because the shape of the statement is almost correct but crucial content is missing.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- The theorem considers n ≥ 6 and N a subgroup of the full symmetric group S_n = Perm (Fin n).
- hN_normal: ∀ g x, x ∈ N → g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N. This asserts N is normal in S_n (conjugation by any g ∈ S_n).
- hN_proper: N ≠ MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign). The kernel of the sign hom is A_n, so this says N ≠ A_n.
- Conclusion: For every i : Fin n and σ : Perm (Fin n), if σ ∈ ker(sign) (i.e., σ ∈ A_n) and σ fixes i (σ i = i), then σ ∈ N. In other words, for each i, the point stabilizer in A_n is contained in N.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Original statement: Let n ≥ 6 and N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n. Show that N contains every subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i}.
- Matching parts:
  - n ≥ 6 is correctly assumed.
  - A_n is correctly modeled as ker(sign).
  - The conclusion ""N contains every G_i"" is correctly formalized as: ∀ i, if σ ∈ A_n and σ fixes i, then σ ∈ N.
- Differences:
  - The original assumes N is a subgroup of A_n and normal in A_n. The Lean code does not assume N ≤ A_n; instead it only assumes N ≠ A_n. Moreover, it assumes N is normal in the entire S_n (stronger than normal in A_n, but in a different ambient group).
  - Thus, the hypotheses are changed: the code uses a different normality condition (normal in S_n rather than in A_n) and omits the inclusion N ≤ A_n, replacing ""proper subgroup of A_n"" with merely ""N ≠ A_n"" without asserting N is a subgroup of A_n.

Step 3: Final check
- The conclusion matches the intended result (G_i ⊆ N for each i), but the hypotheses differ in two substantive ways: normality in S_n instead of A_n, and no requirement that N ⊆ A_n. This is not just a slight specialization/generalization; it changes the ambient group in which normality is considered and does not encode that N is a subgroup of A_n.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is close but not a faithful translation of the original statement.

  Statement: For a fixed natural number n and a subset G of n×n real matrices, under certain hypotheses, the identity matrix 1 (the n×n identity) is in G.
- Hypotheses:
  • h_nonempty : ∃ A, A ∈ G: G is nonempty.

  • h_inv : ∀ A, A ∈ G → ∃ B, B ∈ G ∧ A * B = 1 ∧ B * A = 1: For every A in G, there exists B in G which is a two-sided inverse of A (so A is invertible and its inverse lies in G). This encodes closure under inverses.
- Conclusion: (1 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real) ∈ G: The identity matrix belongs to G.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
Natural language: Let G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(R) be nonempty and closed under products and inverses (a matrix group). Prove that I ∈ G.
The Lean statement precisely matches this: G is a subset of n×n real matrices; it is nonempty; closed under multiplication; and for every A ∈ G there exists an inverse B ∈ G with AB = BA = 1. The conclusion is exactly that the identity matrix (1) is in G. The proof is omitted (sorry), but we're checking translation, not proof.

Step 3: Final comparison and any differences
- Domain and objects match: G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(R) via Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real.
- Nonemptiness and closure under products match directly.
- Closure under inverses: The Lean hypothesis h_inv asserts existence of a two-sided inverse within G for each element, which is equivalent to being closed under inverses in this context. It is a standard formalization and even slightly stronger than only saying ""A⁻¹ ∈ G,"" but mathematically equivalent to the intended meaning here.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no placeholders other than the unproved theorem body (which is allowed for this task). No red flags.
Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Bring in Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace; fine and relevant.
- `def gl (n : ℕ) : Type := { A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real // Matrix.det A ≠ 0 }`: This defines the type gl(n, ℝ) as the subtype of n×n real matrices with nonzero determinant. This faithfully matches the carrier set of GL(n, ℝ) in the natural language statement.
- `def gl_group (n : ℕ) : Group (gl n) := by sorry`: This attempts to define a group structure on gl(n). However, the entire structure is provided by `sorry` (a placeholder/proof hole). It does not specify the group operation, identity, or inverse, nor does it ensure that the multiplication is matrix multiplication. As written, it is a vacuous placeholder.

Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: Show that GL(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A ≠ 0} is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The code correctly defines the carrier set `gl n`.
- However, the crucial part—equipping `gl n` with the group structure coming from matrix multiplication—is not provided. The `gl_group` definition is left as `sorry`, so it neither constructs nor even specifies that the operation is matrix multiplication on the subtype. Thus it fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions not be vacuous.
- Moreover, even if `sorry` were replaced by some arbitrary group structure, the type alone `Group (gl n)` does not enforce that the operation is matrix multiplication; it would need an explicit construction using the matrix multiplication and proofs of the group axioms on this subtype.

Final comparison:
- The math problems are not the same in the code and the statement. The code defines the correct set, but does not provide a legitimate, faithful group structure under matrix multiplication—it's a placeholder. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {F : Type _} [Field F]`: Let F be a field.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: Let n be a finite type with decidable equality (so we are working with n×n matrices indexed by a finite type n). This models the dimension n of matrices.
- `open Matrix`: Open the Matrix namespace.
- `def H (G : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n F))) : Set (Units (Matrix n n F)) := { A | A ∈ (G : Set (Units (Matrix n n F))) ∧ (det (A.val : Matrix n n F) = (1 : F) ∨ det (A.val : Matrix n n F) = -1) }`
  Translation: Given a subgroup G of the group of units of the ring of n×n matrices over F (i.e., invertible matrices), define H to be the subset of invertible matrices A such that A ∈ G and det(A) = 1 or det(A) = −1.
  This matches the intended set H = {A ∈ G | det A = ±1}, noting that the ambient group is `Units (Matrix n n F)` rather than `GL_n(F)` by name; over a field, these are the same group in content.
- `def H_is_subgroup (G : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n F))) : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n F)) := by sorry`
  Translation: The author attempts to define (construct) a subgroup of `Units (Matrix n n F)` from G, with the proof omitted (`sorry`). Crucially, this definition does not reference the previously defined set `H`. It also does not assert or encode that the constructed subgroup has carrier equal to the set H, nor that it is a subgroup ""of G"" (i.e., contained in G). It is just a placeholder returning some subgroup, with no content provided.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: Let F be a field, G ≤ GL_n(F), and define H = {A ∈ G | det A = ±1}. Prove H is a subgroup of G.
- The code models the ambient group as `Units (Matrix n n F)`, which is a reasonable formalization of GL_n(F) over a field. The set H is correctly defined as a subset of invertible matrices lying in G with determinant ±1. So the definition of H as a Set is faithful.
- However, the main claim ""H is a subgroup of G"" is not properly formalized: instead of constructing the subgroup with carrier H (or proving existence/structure for H) and showing it is contained in G, the code provides a `def H_is_subgroup ... := by sorry` that:
  - uses `sorry` (a vacuous placeholder),
  - does not tie the result to the set `H`, and
  - does not express the ""of G"" part (no inclusion `H ≤ G`).
  Thus, the essential mathematical content is missing.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Differences:
  - The proof/content is omitted via `sorry`, which is a vacuous placeholder.
  - The provided ""subgroup"" is not connected to the set H defined above; there's no guarantee it's the subgroup generated by or with carrier H.
  - The statement does not express or prove that the resulting subgroup is a subgroup of G (as in contained in G); it merely returns some subgroup of the ambient group.
- While modeling GL_n(F) as `Units (Matrix n n F)` is acceptable, the key theorem/definition is not faithfully captured.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because the crucial part (that H is a subgroup, specifically the one defined by the determinant condition inside G) is missing and replaced by a placeholder. If one were to fix it by defining a `Subgroup` with `carrier := H G` and proving the subgroup axioms (and thus automatically H ≤ G), it would be faithful. As is, it fails.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: States the intended theorem: in a finite abelian p-group, any maximal proper subgroup has index p; hence composition factors (quotients by maximal normal subgroups) have order p and are isomorphic to ZMod p.
- Theorem signature:
  - `{p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime)`: p is a prime natural number.
  - `{G : Type*} [Group G] [CommGroup G] [Finite G]`: G is a finite abelian (commutative) group.
  - `(hpg : IsPGroup p G)`: G is a p-group.
  - Conclusion: `∀ H : Subgroup G, H ≠ ⊤ → (∀ K : Subgroup G, H ≤ K → (K = H ∨ K = ⊤)) → Subgroup.index H = p`.
    This says: for every subgroup H of G, if H is maximal proper in G (the condition `∀ K, H ≤ K → (K = H ∨ K = ⊤)` precisely expresses maximality among subgroups of G, and `H ≠ ⊤` is redundant but harmless), then the index [G : H] equals p.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: For a prime p, the composition factors of any finite abelian p-group are all isomorphic to Z_p.
- The Lean theorem as stated proves a standard key fact: every maximal subgroup of a finite abelian p-group has index p. In an abelian group, maximal subgroups are normal, so the corresponding quotients (simple factors) have order p. From that, one deduces each factor is cyclic of order p, hence isomorphic to ZMod p. So mathematically, the Lean theorem implies the desired conclusion.
- However, the theorem itself does not state anything explicitly about composition factors or isomorphisms to ZMod p. It only states the maximal-subgroup-index-p property and leaves the “in particular” part in the docstring rather than in the formal statement.

3) Final comparison:
- Similarity: The theorem captures the essential lemma underpinning the natural statement: maximal subgroups (hence composition factors) have index p.
- Differences:
  - The Lean theorem does not mention composition series/factors or isomorphisms; it only asserts index p for maximal proper subgroups.
  - The natural statement concludes explicitly “are all isomorphic to Z_p,” which is not formally asserted in the Lean statement.
  - The Lean theorem addresses maximal subgroups of the ambient group G; for composition series one also needs the analogous fact for maximal subgroups of intermediate subgroups. This is still covered because the theorem is universally quantified over arbitrary finite abelian p-groups, so it can be applied to each subgroup-as-a-group, but this is not spelled out in the statement.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The statement is thus a strong, correct step toward the target but not the exact formalization of the natural-language claim. Therefore it is not a fully faithful translation, though it is very close.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The code defines a predicate `is_field (F : Type*) (add mul : F → F → F) (zero one : F) : Prop` as a conjunction of properties:
  • `∀ a b, add a b = add b a`: addition is commutative.
  • `∀ a b c, add (add a b) c = add a (add b c)`: addition is associative.
  • `∀ a, add a zero = a`: zero is a right additive identity (left identity follows from commutativity).
  • `∀ a, ∃ b, add a b = zero`: existence of additive right inverses (left inverses follow from commutativity).
  • `∀ a b, mul a b = mul b a`: multiplication is commutative.
  • `∀ a, mul a one = a`: one is a right multiplicative identity (left identity follows from commutativity).
  • `one ≠ zero`: distinctness of 1 and 0.
  • `∀ a, a ≠ zero → ∃ b, mul a b = one`: existence of multiplicative right inverses for nonzero elements (left inverses follow from commutativity, but see notes below).
  • `∀ a b c, mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c)`: left distributivity; with commutative multiplication, right distributivity follows.
- The theorem `is_field_iff_axioms` simply states `is_field F add mul zero one ↔ (same conjunction)`, i.e., a definitional unfolding equivalence; proof omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural language statement characterizes a field as:
(1) (F, +) is an abelian group with identity 0;
(2) (F \ {0}, ·) is an abelian group with identity 1;
(3) 1 ≠ 0;
(4) Distributivity a(b+c) = ab + ac for all a,b,c.

Major discrepancies:
- Missing multiplicative associativity: The code does not include associativity of `mul`. An abelian group on F \ {0} requires associativity. This is a critical omission.
- Inverses in F \ {0}: The code asserts for each nonzero `a` there exists `b` with `a*b = 1`, but does not ensure `b ≠ 0`. In a genuine group on F \ {0}, the inverse lies in F \ {0}`. Without stronger axioms (e.g., associativity or other ring properties), one cannot derive `b ≠ 0` from the given axioms.
- The theorem proves a trivial equivalence (by definition) between `is_field` and the same list of axioms, rather than between “F is a field” in the standard/Mathlib sense and the listed conditions. The code does not use Mathlib’s `Field` typeclass or group structures; while this can be acceptable if faithful, here the custom predicate misses essential parts of the definition of a field.
- Distributivity: Only left distributivity is included, but with commutative multiplication this implies right distributivity; so this part is acceptable.
- Additive group: The additive axioms included (commutativity, associativity, right identity, right inverses) suffice to make (F, +) an abelian group due to commutativity, so condition (1) is essentially captured.

Step 3: Final check.
The Lean code’s `is_field` is strictly weaker than the standard notion of a field because it lacks multiplicative associativity and does not ensure inverses lie in F \ {0}. Therefore, the code is not a faithful formalization of the given statement. Furthermore, the final theorem is merely a definitional unfolding, not the intended equivalence with the standard notion of “field”.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type of matrix rows/cols is a finite type n with decidable equality. This encodes n×n matrices.
- The comment explains GL(n, R) is realized as the units of `Matrix n n R`. This is standard.
- The docstring states: if G and H are subgroups of GL(n, R), then their intersection is a subgroup.
- `def matrix_group_intersection (G H : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ)) : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := by sorry`: This attempts to define the intersection subgroup, but the definition is a placeholder using `sorry`, yielding an arbitrary subgroup. It does not specify that the result equals `G ⊓ H` or `G ⊓ H` (the intersection) nor provide any construction.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Given matrix groups G, H ⊂ GL(n), prove that G ∩ H is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup). A faithful Lean formalization would either define `matrix_group_intersection G H := G ⊓ H` or state/construct a theorem showing `G ⊓ H` is a `Subgroup`, which Mathlib already has.
- The provided Lean code does not actually construct the intersection; it introduces a definition with a `sorry` placeholder. This is a vacuous definition that can denote any subgroup and thus does not faithfully capture “the intersection.” There is no theorem or statement asserting that the object equals `G ⊓ H`.
- On the positive side, the ambient generality (commutative ring R, GL realized as units of matrices) is a harmless and standard generalization.

Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code does not state or prove that `G ∩ H` is a subgroup; it merely posits a definition with a placeholder. If the `sorry` were replaced by `G ⊓ H`, it would be faithful. As written, it fails the faithfulness requirement due to the vacuous definition and lack of explicit identification with the intersection.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous/placeholder content (`sorry`) used for the core construction; however, if fixed to `G ⊓ H`, it would be faithful. This matches the rubric’s 6: ""makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful.""

- `variable {F : Type _} [Field F]`: Let F be a field.
- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Define E(t) to be the 2×2 matrix over F indexed by Fin 2 × Fin 2 with entries given by:
  - at (0,0): 1

- `theorem E_mul_E (s t : F) : E s * E t = E (s + t) := by sorry`: States that for all s, t in F, the matrix product E(s) * E(t) equals E(s + t). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task since we are only auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement defines E(t) as [[1,t],[0,1]] over a field F and asserts E(s)E(t) = E(s+t) for all s, t in F. The Lean code defines exactly that matrix and states exactly that equality for all s, t. The type (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F) is appropriate, and the field structure is sufficient for matrix multiplication.

3) Final check for differences:
- The matrix definition matches exactly.
- The quantification over all s, t ∈ F matches the theorem arguments.
- No extraneous hypotheses or weakening/strengthening of the statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the only `sorry` is in the proof, which does not affect the statement.
Therefore, the code is a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- Docstring: Claims we will state that SO(n) = {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ), with proof omitted.
- `open Matrix`: Open the Matrix namespace.
- `def SO (n : Type*) [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n] : Subgroup (Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup n ℝ) := by sorry`:
  This introduces a definition `SO` assigning to each finite index type `n` a subgroup of `GL(n, ℝ)` (as `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup n ℝ`). However, the definition body is `by sorry`, i.e., a placeholder/vacuous definition: it does not specify what subgroup, nor does it build it from {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1}. It neither references `O(n)` nor the determinant condition.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: Prove that SO(n) = {A in O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ)). A faithful formalization would either:
  - Define `SO(n)` as the subset of GL consisting of orthogonal matrices with det = 1 and show subgroup axioms; or
  - State a theorem that this set is a subgroup of GL.
- The provided Lean code does neither. It simply posits the existence of some subgroup named `SO` via a `sorry`, without relating it to O(n) or det = 1. This is a vacuous placeholder and not a legitimate definition of the intended set.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Missing characterization: The code never mentions orthogonality (O(n)) or the determinant condition det = 1.
- Vacuous definition: `by sorry` is used to create a subgroup out of thin air; this violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- No theorem/proof: The natural language asks to prove the set is a matrix group; the code neither states nor proves such a theorem, and does not even define the set.
- The only arguably correct aspect is the ambient target: a subgroup of `GL(n, ℝ)` matches the notion of ""matrix group"". But since the carrier set is unspecified, this does not make the translation faithful.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. It uses a vacuous placeholder and omits the essential definitions and statements connecting to O(n) and det = 1.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code to natural language:
- `def complex_to_mat (z : Complex) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the map sending a complex number z = a + bi to the 2×2 real matrix [[a, -b], [b, a]]. The pattern matching on indices 0 and 1 of `Fin 2` makes this explicit: entry (0,0) and (1,1) are z.re = a; entry (0,1) is -z.im = -b; entry (1,0) is z.im = b. This matches the standard embedding of C into 2×2 real matrices.

- `noncomputable def G_add_subgroup : AddSubgroup (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := by apply AddSubgroup.mk _ ?_proof` intends to define G as an additive subgroup of 2×2 real matrices consisting of those of the special form [[a, -b], [b, a]]. The comment says ""the range of complex_to_mat is an additive subgroup"". However, the actual code does not supply the carrier set (it leaves `_`) nor does it provide the subgroup proofs (closure under addition, zero, and negation) — these are left as holes `?_proof`. As written, this is an incomplete/vacuous definition and would not concretely define G.

- `noncomputable def complex_matrix_add_equiv : AddEquiv Complex ↥G_add_subgroup := by exact (by sorry : AddEquiv Complex ↥G_add_subgroup)` states an additive equivalence (group isomorphism under +) between Complex and the additive subgroup G, but it is filled with `sorry`, so no actual construction is provided. The intended isomorphism is the map z ↦ complex_to_mat z, but it is not implemented.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: (1) show G is a group under matrix addition, and (2) construct an isomorphism (C, +) ≅ G. The Lean structures chosen are appropriate: `AddSubgroup` to express that G is a subgroup of the additive group of matrices, and `AddEquiv` to express an additive group isomorphism.
- However, the key definition of G is not actually given: the carrier set is unspecified (`_`), and the subgroup laws are left as a hole. This makes the definition vacuous/incomplete. The subsequent isomorphism is also left entirely as `sorry`.
- Even though the first definition `complex_to_mat` correctly captures the mapping, the crucial parts — defining G as the image/range of this map or as the set `{[[a,-b],[b,a]]}` and constructing the `AddEquiv` — are not present. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Final comparison:
- Intended math problem: define G = {[[a,-b],[b,a]]}, prove it's an additive group, and construct an additive isomorphism from C to G.
- Lean code: has the right idea (map from C to matrices, intention to define subgroup and isomorphism) but leaves G undefined and the isomorphism unconstructed. It uses vacuous placeholders/holes.
- Conclusion: Not a faithful translation. If the holes were properly filled by defining G as the range of `complex_to_mat` (or the explicit set) and providing the `AddEquiv` induced by `complex_to_mat`, then it would be faithful. As-is, it fails.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv, Subgroup`: Bring in Mathlib and open namespaces for equivalences (permutations) and subgroups.
- `noncomputable section`: Allows noncomputable definitions; not semantically relevant to the statement.
- `def sigma (n : ℕ) : Perm (Fin n) := ...`: Defines a permutation on `Fin n` (i.e., the set {0,1,...,n-1}) as the map `i ↦ i + 1 (mod n)` using `Equiv.ofBijective`. The mapping function is explicitly `fun i : Fin n => Fin.ofNat n (i.val + 1)`, which represents the cyclic successor mod n. The bijectivity proof is left as `sorry`, but the intended permutation is clear: this is the standard n-cycle `(0 1 2 ... n-1)`.
- The main theorem:
  `theorem symmetric_generated_by_transposition_and_cycle (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  Subgroup.closure ({swap (Fin.ofNat n 0) (Fin.ofNat n 1), sigma n} : Set (Perm (Fin n))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n))) := by sorry`
  This states: For `n ≥ 2`, the subgroup of `Perm (Fin n)` generated by the two elements `swap (Fin.ofNat n 0) (Fin.ofNat n 1)` (the transposition swapping 0 and 1) and `sigma n` (the n-cycle) equals the whole group `(⊤ : Subgroup (Perm (Fin n)))`. In words: the symmetric group on `n` letters (realized as permutations of `Fin n`) is generated by the transposition (0 1) and the n-cycle (0 1 2 ... n-1).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For `n ≥ 2`, `Sym_n` is generated by the set `S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}`.
- The Lean code formulates `Sym_n` as `Perm (Fin n)` and uses generators: the transposition `swap 0 1` and the n-cycle sending `i` to `i+1 mod n`. This corresponds exactly to the usual generators `(1 2)` and `(1 2 ... n)` up to a shift from 1-based to 0-based indexing. The group generated equals the top subgroup (the whole symmetric group), which is the formal way to state “these elements generate the whole group.” The hypothesis `2 ≤ n` matches the statement.
- Thus, the theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- Indexing: The code uses `Fin n` with elements `0,1,...,n-1` and generators `(0 1)` and `(0 1 2 ... n-1)`; the natural statement uses `(1,2)` and `(1,2,...,n)`. These are the same up to relabeling/indexing and are standardly considered equivalent.
- The auxiliary definition `sigma` correctly captures the intended n-cycle via the successor mod n function; the bijectivity proof is omitted via `sorry`, but this does not change the intended meaning of the defined permutation. No vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts used (Perm, swap, Subgroup.closure, ⊤) are standard Mathlib notions.
- Therefore, the Lean statement matches the mathematical content of the natural language statement with only a harmless indexing shift.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Natural language translation:
- Let G be a finite group (Group G and Fintype G).
- Let p, r be natural numbers with p prime (hp) and r ≥ 1 (hr).
- Assume |G| = p^r (hG).
- Assume also that the set of elements g in G commuting with every x in G (i.e., the center) has a Fintype structure (hZ). This is the subtype {g : G // ∀ x, g * x = x * g}, i.e., the center Z(G).
- Conclusion: There exists k ∈ ℕ with 1 ≤ k such that the cardinality of that subtype (the center) equals p^k.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The original statement: For a group G of order p^r with p prime and r ≥ 1, prove that |Z(G)| = p^k for some integer k ≥ 1.
- The Lean statement matches this: it asserts existence of k ≥ 1 with |center| = p^k. It represents Z(G) as the subtype of elements commuting with all elements, which is exactly the center.
- The assumptions hp, hr, hG correspond exactly to the original hypotheses.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Minor difference: The Lean statement includes an extra hypothesis hZ providing a Fintype instance for the center as a subtype. Mathematically, since G is finite, Z(G) is finite, so this is a redundant/technical assumption to ensure a Fintype instance is available. It does not change the mathematical content of the theorem. However, as a formal statement, it is a slightly stronger hypothesis than necessary.
- They use ℕ for k (nonnegative integer) and explicitly require 1 ≤ k, which matches “integer k ≥ 1.”
- They do not use Mathlib's built-in center Subgroup but the equivalent subtype definition of central elements; that is faithful to the concept of Z(G).
- No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions are introduced; the theorem is stated with a sorry proof, which is permitted.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement, with only a minor, technical extra assumption (hZ) that is redundant in the mathematical context.

- Definition `is_reflection (M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) : Prop := Mᵀ * M = 1 ∧ M.det = -1`:
  This says: a 2×2 real matrix M is a reflection if it is orthogonal (Mᵀ M = I) and has determinant −1. This matches the usual characterization of reflections in O(2).
- Definition `is_rotation (M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) : Prop := Mᵀ * M = 1 ∧ M.det = 1`:
  This says: a 2×2 real matrix M is a rotation if it is orthogonal and has determinant 1. This is exactly the definition of membership in SO(2).
- Theorem `product_of_two_reflections_is_rotation (A B : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) (hA : is_reflection A) (hB : is_reflection B) : is_rotation (A * B) := by sorry`:
  This states: if A and B are 2×2 real matrices that are reflections (orthogonal with det −1), then their product A * B is a rotation (orthogonal with det 1). No proof is provided, as allowed by the task.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: ""Show that the product of any two reflection matrices in O(2) is a rotation matrix (i.e., an element of SO(2)).""
- The code works over 2×2 real matrices, i.e., the standard model for O(2) and SO(2).
- ""Reflection matrix in O(2)"" is encoded as orthogonal with determinant −1.
- ""Rotation matrix (element of SO(2))"" is encoded as orthogonal with determinant 1.
- The theorem asserts exactly that the product of two such reflections is a rotation.
Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; both predicates are meaningful and standard.
- No scope mismatch: both are for 2×2 real matrices, matching O(2) and SO(2).
- No extra hypotheses or missing conditions. The statement is neither a generalization nor a specialization beyond the intended 2D real case.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  - If i = 0 and j = 0, entry is 1.
  - If i = 0 and j ≠ 0, entry is t.
  - If i ≠ 0 and j = 0, entry is 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For all t in F, E(t)^{-1} = E(−t). The Lean theorem states E t * E (−t) = 1. Over square matrices over a field, AB = I implies that B is the inverse of A (and BA = I holds as well), so this is an equivalent way to express that E(−t) is the inverse of E(t). Thus the statement is faithful, even though it does not use the inverse notation explicitly.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The matrix E(t) is defined exactly as [[1, t], [0, 1]].
- The theorem asserts E(t) multiplied by E(−t) is the identity, which is equivalent to E(−t) = (E(t))^{-1} for 2×2 matrices over a field. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The only difference is stylistic (using AB = I instead of B = A^{-1}), which is mathematically equivalent in this context.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix depending on θ. The entries are:
  - H₀₀ = cos(2θ), H₀₁ = sin(2θ), H₁₀ = sin(2θ), H₁₁ = −cos(2θ).
  This is the standard formula for the reflection matrix across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis.
- The theorem `reflection_matrix_improper_orthogonal (θ : ℝ) : (H θ * (H θ).transpose = 1) ∧ (Matrix.det (H θ) = (-1 : ℝ))` asserts for each θ that Hθ is orthogonal (via Hθ Hθ^T = I) and has determinant −1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement has two parts: (i) the reflection across the given line is a linear operator; (ii) its matrix Hθ is an improper orthogonal matrix, i.e., Hθ ∈ O(2) and det(Hθ) = −1.
- The code directly defines the explicit matrix Hθ of that reflection and asserts the two key properties: orthogonality (via Hθ Hθᵀ = I, which characterizes membership in O(2)) and determinant −1. This captures the second part precisely.
- The first part (that the reflection map is linear) is not explicitly stated or proved in the code. However, by giving an explicit 2×2 matrix, one implicitly has a linear operator on ℝ² (matrix multiplication defines a linear map). The code’s docstring names H as the reflection matrix across the specified line, matching the intended geometric meaning. There is no vacuous or placeholder definition.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- Differences:
  - The code does not explicitly state “the reflection is a linear operator.” It only defines the matrix H and proves orthogonality and determinant −1.
  - It does not explicitly state Hθ ∈ O(2) as an element of a specific Lean type for the orthogonal group; instead it asserts the defining orthogonality equation, which is equivalent.
- These are minor omissions rather than misstatements. The central mathematical content (improper orthogonality with determinant −1 for the reflection matrix) is faithfully captured, and the definition of H matches the standard reflection matrix.

Overall, the translation is essentially faithful, with a small omission of the explicit linearity claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We work over a commutative ring R.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type for matrix rows/columns is a finite type n with decidable equality (so matrices are n×n over R).
- `def is_diagonal (M : Matrix n n R) : Prop := ∀ i j, i ≠ j → M i j = 0`: A matrix M is diagonal if all off-diagonal entries are zero.
- `def D1_set : Set (Matrix n n R) := {M | is_diagonal M ∧ Matrix.det M = 1}`: D1_set is the set of n×n matrices over R that are diagonal and have determinant 1 (i.e., diagonal matrices in SL_n(R), viewed as plain matrices in M_n(R)).
- `def D1 : Set ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := {u | is_diagonal (u : Matrix n n R) ∧ Matrix.det (u : Matrix n n R) = 1}`: D1 is the set of invertible matrices (units in the matrix ring) which are diagonal and have determinant 1; i.e., the diagonal part of SL_n(R), viewed as a subset of GL_n(R).
- `def D1_is_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := by sorry`: This purports to define a specific subgroup of the group of units, but gives no data tying it to D1 (and the proof/data is omitted with `sorry`).

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language?
- The natural language says: Let D1(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n). Show that D1(n) is a matrix group. In formal terms, we want a statement that the set of diagonal matrices with determinant 1 forms a subgroup (of SL_n or equivalently of GL_n).
- The code correctly defines the set of diagonal det=1 matrices both as matrices (D1_set) and as units (D1). This matches the intended set up to the standard formalization choice of placing subgroups inside ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) rather than inside SL_n.
- However, the final declaration `D1_is_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ)` does not assert that the subgroup is exactly D1. It simply claims the existence (actually, gives a definition placeholder) of some subgroup of ((Matrix n n R)ˣ), without any relation to D1. The correct formal statement should be something like `def D1_subgroup : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ) := { carrier := D1, ... }` or a theorem `IsClosedUnder...` showing `IsClosed` properties to construct such a subgroup with carrier D1. As written, the final line is not about D1 at all.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The intended claim is ""D1 is a subgroup."" The code's final statement does not mention D1 and thus does not state that D1 is a subgroup. Additionally, it leaves the subgroup data as `sorry`. While proofs can be omitted, the statement itself must tie to D1 to be faithful. Here it does not.
- Minor acceptable generalization: working over a general commutative ring and representing groups as units is fine. The core issue is the missing link between the defined set D1 and the asserted subgroup.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

theorem D_units_is_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) := by sorry
",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Variables: n is a finite index type with decidable equality; R is a commutative ring. We are working with n×n matrices over R.
- is_diag A: A matrix A is diagonal if every off-diagonal entry A i j with i ≠ j is zero. This is a standard and correct definition.
- D: the set of all diagonal n×n matrices over R (no invertibility requirement).
- D_units: the set of invertible matrices (Units of Matrix n n R) whose underlying matrix is diagonal; i.e., the set of diagonal matrices that are invertible, a subset of GL(n, R).
- D_units_is_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)): This declares that there exists some subgroup of Units(Matrix n n R), but it does not specify that the carrier of this subgroup is D_units. The name and the docstring suggest the intended claim is that D_units is a subgroup, but the type does not state that.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural statement: Let D(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in GL(n). Show that D(n) is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup of GL(n)).
- The code’s D_units matches the intended D(n): diagonal matrices in GL(n).
- However, the final theorem does not assert that D_units is a subgroup; it merely produces (or asserts the existence of) some subgroup of GL(n). There is no link between this subgroup and D_units in the Lean statement. Therefore, the crucial content of the natural language statement is not captured by the theorem type.
- The auxiliary definition D (diagonal matrices in the full matrix ring) is fine as context, and D_units is the correct subset in GL(n). But the theorem must be something like: “def D_units_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) := { carrier := D_units, ... }” or a theorem explicitly stating that D_units is closed under multiplication and inverses and contains 1. The present theorem type is not faithful.

Step 3: Final check of differences.
- Main mismatch: The theorem does not assert that the set D_units forms a subgroup; it simply states the existence of a subgroup of GL(n) unrelated to D_units. This fails to translate the mathematical content.
- Minor issues: assuming CommRing R is a slight specialization (acceptable). Using Units(Matrix n n R) instead of GeneralLinearGroup is fine. The use of sorry is acceptable for translation auditing as long as the statement is correct, but here the statement itself is wrong.

Conclusion: Not faithful. A correct translation would directly construct a Subgroup whose carrier is D_units (or prove that D_units is a subgroup).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: We are using Mathlib's matrix and algebra infrastructure.
- def E_ij ... : Matrix n n R := fun a b => if a = b then 1 else if a = i ∧ b = j then t else 0: For a finite index type n and a commutative ring R, E_ij(R) i j t is the n×n matrix with 1's on the diagonal and an extra t in the (i, j) position (row i, column j), and 0 elsewhere. This is precisely the matrix obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i when multiplied on the left.
- theorem E_ij_det_one ... (h : i ≠ j) : (E_ij ...).det = 1: For i ≠ j, the determinant of this matrix is 1. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n and t ∈ ℝ, the elementary matrix E_{ij}(t) (obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i) lies in SL(n). In standard algebra, SL(n) is the group of matrices with determinant 1.
- The Lean definition E_ij matches the described elementary matrix exactly.
- The theorem asserts det(E_ij) = 1 (under i ≠ j), which is equivalent to E_ij ∈ SL(n) in Mathlib (SL is defined via determinant 1). Thus the essential content is captured.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- Domain of scalars: The statement uses ℝ; the code generalizes to any commutative ring R. This is a benign generalization.
- Indices: The statement uses integers 1..n; the code uses an arbitrary finite type n with DecidableEq and Fintype. This is the standard Mathlib formalization and is acceptable.
- The code states det = 1 rather than explicitly E_ij ∈ SL(n). Since SL(n) is defined by det = 1, this is equivalent.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: E_ij is a genuine matrix definition. The theorem's proof is omitted, which is allowed; the statement itself is substantive and correct.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully formalizes the statement (indeed, slightly generalizes it) without vacuous placeholders. It passes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We fix an index type n with a finite set of indices (Fintype n) and decidable equality, and a real n×n matrix A.
- Hypothesis h: for all indices i, j in n, the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals if i = j then 1 else 0. Interpreting A k i as the (k,i)-entry, this is exactly (Aᵀ A)_{i j} = δ_{ij}, i.e., the columns of A are orthonormal with respect to the standard dot product on ℝ^n.
- Conclusion: the family of column vectors (fun i => Matrix.col A i) is linearly independent over ℝ and its span is the whole space (Submodule.span ... = ⊤). This is exactly saying the set of columns forms a basis of ℝ^n. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but that's acceptable per the task since we only check the statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If A ∈ O(n) (i.e., A is orthogonal, Aᵀ A = I), then the set of columns {A₁, …, Aₙ} is an orthonormal basis of ℝ^n.
- The Lean hypothesis h is precisely Aᵀ A = I written entrywise (the Kronecker delta condition), i.e., the defining property of A ∈ O(n). So the assumption matches the mathematical content of A ∈ O(n).
- The Lean conclusion asserts the columns form a basis (linear independence and span = ⊤). Together with h (orthonormality), this yields that the columns are an orthonormal basis. The theorem does not re-state orthonormality in the conclusion, but it is present as a hypothesis, so the combined information is exactly “orthonormal basis.”

3) Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - The code assumes the orthonormality (Aᵀ A = I) directly rather than stating A ∈ O(n). This is mathematically equivalent in this context.
  - The conclusion in Lean states only “basis” (LI + span), not explicitly “orthonormal basis,” but the orthonormal part is the hypothesis h, so the overall statement (hypothesis + conclusion) matches the target “orthonormal basis.”
- There are no vacuous definitions and no placeholders except the proof, which is allowed. The formal objects used (Matrix.col, LinearIndependent, Submodule.span, Set.range) are standard Mathlib notions.

Hence the code is essentially a faithful formalization of the statement (modulo a standard equivalence in the hypothesis and splitting the conclusion into hypothesis + basis).

- `theorem sgn_mul {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 ≤ n) (α β : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :`: Fix a natural number n with hypothesis 1 ≤ n, and permutations α, β on `Fin n` (the type with n elements, i.e., {0, ..., n-1}).

Here `*` is the group multiplication (composition) for permutations, and `Equiv.Perm.sign` returns the sign (±1, typically as an integer). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but our task only audits the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For n ≥ 1 and α, β ∈ S_n (permutations of {1, ..., n}), prove sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β).
- Lean: For n ≥ 1 and α, β permutations on Fin n, `sign (α * β) = sign α * sign β`.
- This is precisely the same mathematical statement, differing only by standard encoding choices: `S_n` as `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` (using {0, ..., n-1} instead of {1, ..., n}), and sign landing in integers (±1). The composition order convention is standard in Lean and does not affect the multiplicativity statement since multiplication of ±1 is commutative.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: `{1, ..., n}` vs `Fin n` (i.e., `{0, ..., n-1}`) — equivalent modeling.
- Hypothesis `1 ≤ n` is present in both.
- Target of sign: integers ±1 — standard and faithful.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def alpha : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) (1 : Fin 3)` defines α as the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in the symmetric group on three elements, i.e., the permutation (0 1). This corresponds to (1 2) under the usual shift from Fin 3 = {0,1,2} to {1,2,3}.
- `def beta : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := (Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) (2 : Fin 3)) * (Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) (1 : Fin 3))` defines β as the composition swap(0,2) ∘ swap(0,1). In Mathlib, multiplication is function composition with the right factor applied first. Computing shows this is the 3-cycle (0 1 2), corresponding to (1 2 3) under the 0↦1,1↦2,2↦3 relabeling.
- `def G : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)) := Subgroup.closure ({alpha, beta} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))` defines G as the subgroup of S3 generated by α and β.
- `theorem ... : Subgroup.closure ({alpha, beta} ...) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))` states that the subgroup generated by α and β is the whole group of permutations on Fin 3, i.e., G = S3.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement is: Let α = (1,2) and β = (1,2,3) in S3, and let G = ⟨α, β⟩. Show G = S3. The Lean code defines α and β exactly as those permutations (with 0-based indexing) and asserts that the closure of {α, β} is ⊤, i.e., S3. This matches the statement precisely.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses Fin 3 = {0,1,2} instead of {1,2,3}. This is a harmless relabeling.
- Composition order: Confirmed that the product chosen for β indeed yields the 3-cycle (0 1 2), matching (1 2 3) under relabeling. No other discrepancies. The auxiliary definition `G` is legitimate though not used in the theorem, but this is fine.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

  This defines O(n) as the subtype (i.e., collection as a type) of n×n real matrices satisfying A Aᵀ = I. Here `1` is the identity matrix and `Matrix.transpose A` is Aᵀ. This matches the usual set-theoretic definition of the orthogonal group using the condition A Aᵀ = I (which is equivalent to Aᵀ A = I over ℝ).

- `noncomputable def O_group (n : ℕ) : Group (O n) := by sorry`
  This declares a group structure on O(n) but supplies it via `sorry`, i.e., a placeholder. The comment indicates the intended structure: multiplication inherited from matrices, identity = 1, inverse = transpose. However, the actual fields and proofs (closure, associativity, identity laws, inverse laws) are not provided; they are replaced by a global `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to prove that O(n) = {A : A Aᵀ = I} is a group under matrix multiplication, using (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T. The code defines the correct set O(n), but the crucial part—the proof and construction of the group structure—is entirely omitted and replaced by `sorry`. Thus, while the goal is aligned, the formalization does not actually provide the proof or the structure; it only asserts its existence via a placeholder.

3) Comparison and discrepancies:
- Match: The set O(n) is defined correctly via A Aᵀ = I.
- Mismatch: The statement requires a proof that O(n) is a group under matrix multiplication. The Lean code attempts to define a `Group (O n)` but does so with `sorry`, i.e., a vacuous placeholder. No use of the identities (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} or (AB)^T = B^T A^T appears in the code. There is no explicit construction of the group operations and no verification of the group axioms.

Given the guidelines, the presence of a vacuous `sorry` in the core theorem/definition means the translation fails, even though, if the `sorry` were replaced by proper proofs, the result would match the natural language statement.

Grade rationale: The definition of O(n) is correct and in line with mathlib notions; the failure is entirely due to the vacuous group structure. If the `sorry` were fixed, the final definition would be faithful. Hence a mid-level grade is appropriate.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is that SO(2), the group of proper orthogonal 2×2 real matrices, is exactly the set of rotation matrices R_θ. The Lean statement asserts set equality between the set of proper orthogonal matrices and the image of θ ↦ R_θ. This is precisely the mathematical content. Using set equality (rather than explicitly invoking the group structure) is standard and faithful, since the statement concerns equality of underlying sets.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses set equality rather than group isomorphism or structure; this matches the phrasing ""is exactly the set of"".
- The definition of SO(2) via AᵀA = I and det A = 1 is correct.
- The rotation matrix is correctly defined.
- Using `Set.range rot` accounts for all rotation matrices; duplicates from different θ (e.g., differing by 2π) do not affect set equality.
No discrepancies or vacuous placeholders are present. The theorem is stated without proof (`sorry`), but the task is to assess the faithfulness of the translation, not the proof. The code compiles with `sorry` permitted.

The Lean statement establishes precisely these three facts for the family E(t), from which it follows that G is a group under multiplication. It even gives the explicit multiplication law and inverses.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- The code defines G but does not explicitly state “G is a group” (e.g., as a Subgroup or a Group instance). Instead, it states the concrete algebraic laws for E(t) that imply G is a group. This is a standard and faithful way to present the result, and from these equalities one immediately derives closure, identity in G, and inverses in G.
- Associativity is not restated (nor needed) since it comes from matrix multiplication. This matches the usual mathematical proof.
- Thus, while not packaged as a Subgroup, the content is essentially identical to the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful; minor stylistic difference (not packaging as a Subgroup) does not affect correctness.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `rotation_matrix (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]] using `Fin 2` indices. This is the standard rotation matrix by angle θ.
- `rotate (θ : ℝ) : (Fin 2 → ℝ) → (Fin 2 → ℝ) := ...` defines the linear map on ℝ^2 (represented as functions `Fin 2 → ℝ`) given by multiplying a vector by the above rotation matrix. It explicitly computes the i-th coordinate as a two-term sum using entries of the matrix.
- `SO2 := { M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // M ∈ Set.range rotation_matrix }` defines “SO2” as the subtype of 2×2 real matrices that lie in the image of `θ ↦ rotation_matrix θ`. So this is the set of rotation matrices, i.e., the image of ℝ under the rotation-matrix map. This is not the usual definition of SO(2) as {A ∈ O(2) | det A = 1}, though in dimension 2 these sets coincide; the code simply takes the range as the definition.
- `Rotations := { f : (Fin 2 → ℝ) → (Fin 2 → ℝ) // f ∈ Set.range rotate }` defines the set of rotations of ℝ^2 as functions, i.e., the image of `θ ↦ rotate θ` (maps given by those rotation matrices). This corresponds to the set {ρ_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} of plane rotations.
- `noncomputable def SO2_equiv_rotations : SO2 ≃ Rotations := by sorry` states there is a bijection (type equivalence `≃`) between the set of rotation matrices and the set of rotation functions, but does not provide a proof (left as `sorry`).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claims an isomorphism of groups: SO(2), the matrix group (with multiplication), is isomorphic to the group of rotations of ℝ^2 (with composition). This is a group isomorphism statement.
- The code only asserts a type equivalence `≃` between two subtypes (sets) defined as ranges of parameterizations by θ. It does not equip either side with a group structure, nor does it express a group isomorphism (which in Lean would be a `MulEquiv` for matrices under multiplication and functions under composition). Thus, the code states a bijection of underlying sets, not a group isomorphism.
- Additionally, the code uses a nonstandard definition of SO(2) as the range of rotation matrices, rather than as the special orthogonal group {A | AᵀA = I, det A = 1}. While these sets coincide in 2D, the code does not even claim or prove this equivalence; it simply defines SO2 to be the range. This by itself could be acceptable if the goal is to show isomorphism with the group of rotations, but it underscores that the code is not engaging with the usual group structure.

Final comparison:
- Original: “SO(2) is isomorphic (as a group) to the group {ρ_θ} of rotations of ℝ^2.”
- Lean: “There is a bijection between the set of rotation matrices and the set of rotation maps.” No group structure or homomorphism property is stated.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it replaces group isomorphism with mere set-theoretic bijection and defines SO(2) as a range rather than the special orthogonal group. There are no vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definitions are legitimate. The mismatch is conceptual (group isomorphism vs equivalence of sets). Hence it does not pass.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def H0 : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix H0 with entries H0(0,0)=1, H0(0,1)=0, H0(1,0)=0, H0(1,1)=-1. This is exactly the reflection across the x-axis, i.e., diag(1, -1).
- `def is_O2 (A ...) : Prop := Matrix.transpose A * A = 1` defines orthogonality in 2×2 as Aᵀ A = I. This matches the standard definition of O(2).
- `def is_SO2 (A ...) : Prop := Matrix.transpose A * A = 1 ∧ Matrix.det A = 1` defines special orthogonality in 2×2 as Aᵀ A = I and det A = 1, which matches SO(2).
- The theorem `improper_reflection_products_in_SO2` states: for any 2×2 real matrix H, if H is orthogonal (`hO : is_O2 H`) and has determinant −1 (`hdet : Matrix.det H = -1`), then both products `H0 * H` and `H * H0` satisfy `is_SO2`, i.e., are in SO(2).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumption “H is a 2×2 improper orthogonal matrix” is captured by `hO : is_O2 H` and `hdet : Matrix.det H = -1` with H a `(Fin 2) × (Fin 2)` real matrix.
- The matrix `H0` is precisely the reflection across the x-axis.
- The conclusion “H0 H and H H0 both belong to SO(2)” is formalized as `is_SO2 (H0 * H) ∧ is_SO2 (H * H0)`.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `is_O2` and `is_SO2` are legitimate, faithful definitions. Using custom predicates instead of Mathlib’s group structures is acceptable here and faithful.

Final check:
- The math problems are the same: both assert that for any 2×2 improper orthogonal real matrix H (orthogonal with det −1), the products with the fixed reflection H0 on either side are in SO(2). No extra assumptions or omissions are present. The base field ℝ and size 2×2 match the statement. The theorem statement contains both products, as required.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Translate the Lean code line by line:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv` bring in Mathlib and the `Equiv` namespace, which contains `Equiv.Perm` (the symmetric group on a type) and `swap` (transpositions).
- The theorem statement `theorem transposition_factorization_identity_even (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :` sets up the context: a natural number n with the hypothesis 1 ≤ n, matching the natural language assumption n ≥ 1.
- `∀ (l : List (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))),` quantifies over finite lists of permutations of `Fin n` (i.e., elements of S_n). Using `Fin n` is the standard Lean encoding of the set {0, …, n-1}, which is isomorphic to {1, …, n} used in the natural statement.
- `l.prod = (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) →` assumes the product (composition) of the list entries is the identity permutation. In Mathlib, the group operation on permutations is composition and `1` is the identity permutation.
- `(∀ σ ∈ l, ∃ (i j : Fin n), i ≠ j ∧ σ = Equiv.swap i j) →` assumes each permutation σ in the list is a transposition swapping two distinct elements i and j, exactly capturing “product of transpositions”. The condition i ≠ j prevents the trivial swap.
- `∃ m : ℕ, l.length = 2 * m` concludes the length of the list is even.
- The proof is `by sorry`, but per the instructions we only check the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For n ≥ 1, in S_n, any factorization of the identity as a product of transpositions uses an even number of transpositions.
- Lean statement: For n ≥ 1, any list of permutations of `Fin n` whose product is identity and each factor is a transposition must have even length.
- This is a direct formalization. The use of `Fin n` vs `{1, …, n}` is a harmless standard formalization choice. The conclusion “even number” is encoded as existence of m with length = 2*m.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The Lean code includes the assumption `1 ≤ n`, matching the natural statement.
- It requires that each factor is exactly a swap of two distinct elements, matching transpositions.
- It allows the empty factorization, yielding even length 0, which is consistent with the statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is precise and standard.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Here `G →* G × H` is the type of monoid (group) homomorphisms from G to G × H, and `Function.Injective` asserts injectivity of the underlying function.

2. Assessing faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: “Show that the map φ: G → G × H given by φ(x) = (x,1) is an injective homomorphism.”
- The Lean statement asserts the existence of a monoid homomorphism f whose underlying function is exactly `x ↦ (x,1)` and that f is injective. This directly captures that the specific map φ is a homomorphism and injective.
- Using groups (rather than monoids) is a harmless specialization and fully consistent with the original statement.

3. Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib (`G →* G × H`, injective function).
- The Lean theorem is an exact formalization: it identifies the concrete function `(x,1)` and proves it is a homomorphism and injective (expressed as existence of the corresponding `MonoidHom` with that underlying function and injectivity).
- No scope mismatch or extra hypotheses beyond G, H being groups.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

  - Let G and H be types with group structures.
  - Let f be a monoid homomorphism from G to H (in Mathlib, group homomorphisms are represented by `MonoidHom` when the domain/codomain have group structures).
  - Statement: `Function.Injective (f : G → H) ↔ MonoidHom.ker f = (⊥ : Subgroup G)` means: f is injective as a function if and only if the kernel of f (the subgroup of G consisting of elements mapping to the identity in H) equals ⊥, the trivial subgroup `{1}` of G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f: G → H is a group homomorphism with kernel K, then f is injective if and only if K is the trivial subgroup.
- The Lean statement exactly asserts: f is injective iff ker f = ⊥. This is the same as saying the kernel is trivial. The variable K is not introduced separately, but `MonoidHom.ker f` plays the role of K, and equality to ⊥ captures “K is trivial.”
- Using `MonoidHom` under `[Group G] [Group H]` is standard in Mathlib and correctly models a group homomorphism. The kernel is a `Subgroup G`, and ⊥ is the trivial subgroup. All notions used are legitimate Mathlib concepts; no placeholders or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same mathematically: injectivity of a group homomorphism is equivalent to having trivial kernel. No scope or generality mismatch (they restricted to groups, as required). No auxiliary definitions. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem states: for a natural number n with proof hn : 2 ≤ n, the subgroup of the symmetric group on Fin n (i.e., Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) generated by a certain set equals the whole group (⊤).
- The set in question is `Set.range (fun i : Fin (n - 1) => ...)`, so it is the image of indices i = 0,1,...,n-2 under some map to permutations. This is a set of generators indexed by Fin (n - 1).
- Inside the lambda, they set `h1 : 1 ≤ n` deduced from `2 ≤ n`, then define `eq : (n - 1) + 1 = n` via `Nat.sub_add_cancel h1`. This equality is used to cast elements from `Fin ((n - 1) + 1)` to `Fin n`.
- They then produce the permutation `Equiv.swap (Fin.cast eq (Fin.castSucc i)) (Fin.cast eq (Fin.succ i))`. Here, for i : Fin (n - 1):
  - `Fin.castSucc i` is the element i viewed in `Fin ((n - 1) + 1)` (i.e., in `Fin n`).
  - `Fin.succ i` is i+1, also in `Fin ((n - 1) + 1)`.
  - `Fin.cast eq` transports both to `Fin n` using the equality `(n - 1) + 1 = n`.
  - `Equiv.swap a b` is the transposition swapping those two adjacent elements a and b in `Fin n`.
- Thus the set `Set.range ...` is exactly the set of adjacent transpositions (0 1), (1 2), ..., (n-2 n-1) in `Perm (Fin n)`.
- The conclusion `= (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)))` asserts that the subgroup generated by these swaps is the entire symmetric group on n letters.
- The proof is left as `by sorry`, but for our task we only audit the statement/translation, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For n ≥ 2, S_n is generated by the adjacent transpositions {(1,2), (2,3), ..., (n-1,n)}.
- The Lean statement: For n ≥ 2, the subgroup of Perm (Fin n) generated by the adjacent swaps (0 1), (1 2), ..., (n-2 n-1) is the whole group.
- Using `Perm (Fin n)` to represent S_n is standard. The index shift from 1-based {(1,2),...,(n-1,n)} to 0-based {(0,1),...,(n-2,n-1)} is a conventional translation between {1,...,n} and Fin n = {0,...,n-1}. The meaning is identical.
- The codomain equality to `⊤` exactly states that the generated subgroup is the whole symmetric group.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same statement up to indexing convention (1-based vs 0-based). No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the internal lets are legitimate type-casting aids. No red flags. Therefore the translation is faithful.

- `def zmod_mul_equiv_prod {m n : ℕ} (hc : Nat.Coprime m n) : AddEquiv (ZMod (m * n)) (ZMod m × ZMod n) := by sorry`: This declares (without constructing the proof/data) an additive group isomorphism between Z/(mn)Z and Z/mZ × Z/nZ, under the hypothesis that m and n are coprime. In Lean, `AddEquiv` is an isomorphism of additive groups.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: If m, n are relatively prime, then C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n, where C_k is the cyclic group of order k.
- In Lean, `ZMod k` is the standard concrete model of the cyclic group of order k (for k ≥ 1), and it is canonical to state such results with `ZMod`. The isomorphism type `AddEquiv (ZMod (m * n)) (ZMod m × ZMod n)` exactly matches the group isomorphism C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n, using additive notation.
- The code uses an additive isomorphism (`AddEquiv`) rather than a multiplicative one because `ZMod` is an additive group, but this is merely a change of notation and is mathematically equivalent.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/assumptions: The natural statement customarily assumes positive integers; the Lean statement allows all natural numbers but requires `Nat.Coprime m n`. This does not introduce a mismatch because the only potentially problematic zero cases are excluded except in harmless cases (e.g., m=0 implies n=1 to be coprime, and the statement remains true). The intended mathematical content remains the same.
- Use of `ZMod` vs. abstract `C_n`: These are canonically isomorphic; choosing `ZMod` is a standard faithful formalization. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the only placeholder is the proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `axiom A5_simple : Prop` introduces a bare proposition symbol named `A5_simple`. It does not define what it means (e.g., that the alternating group A5 is simple). It is a placeholder with no mathematical content beyond being a proposition.
- `axiom galois_group_general_quintic_is_S5 : Prop` similarly introduces an uninterpreted proposition symbol. It does not formalize the statement that the Galois group of the general quintic is S5.
- `axiom general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals : Prop` introduces another bare proposition symbol, intended to stand for “the general quintic is solvable by radicals,” but no definition is given connecting it to any mathlib notion (e.g., radical extensions, solvability of the Galois group, etc.).
- The theorem

  says: assuming proofs of the two placeholder propositions `A5_simple` and `galois_group_general_quintic_is_S5`, conclude the negation of the placeholder proposition `general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals`. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Assuming A5 is simple and the Galois group of the general quintic is S5, prove that the roots of a general quintic cannot be expressed in terms of radicals.”
- The code mirrors the logical structure (from two assumptions to a negated solvability-by-radicals conclusion), but all the crucial notions are replaced by vacuous, uninterpreted propositions. There is no connection to mathlib’s group theory, Galois groups, or definitions of solvability by radicals.
- Per the guidelines, auxiliary definitions must be legitimate, not vacuous placeholders. Here, all three axioms are vacuous placeholders, not faithful mathlib formalizations (e.g., no `AlternatingGroup (Fin 5)`, no `IsSimpleGroup`, no `GaloisGroup` on an appropriate field tower, no definition of “solvable by radicals”).
- Thus the code does not legitimately or faithfully formalize the mathematical content; it only mimics the shape of the argument with uninterpreted propositional variables.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code’s theorem is about abstract propositional variables and does not state anything concrete about A5, S5, Galois groups, or radicals. The natural language statement is a precise mathematical claim involving specific groups and the notion of solvability by radicals. The code does not capture these specifics.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by proper mathlib notions and the theorem stated with those notions, the structure would be appropriate, but as-is it fails due to vacuous placeholders.

- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We work in a type G with a group structure.
- The theorem statement:
  - Inputs: a natural number n; a family of subgroups H : Fin n → Subgroup G; a function m : (∀ i, H i) → G; and the hypothesis h_inj : Function.Injective m.
  - Conclusion: For all i, j : Fin n, if i ≠ j then (H i ∩ H j) as sets equals {1} as a set.
- The comment says m is “the multiplication map ... encoding uniqueness of decomposition.” But in the formal statement, m is an arbitrary function from the dependent product ∀ i, H i to G, with only injectivity assumed.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If G is the internal direct product of normal subgroups H1, …, Hn (i.e., G = H1 × … × Hn internally), then for any i ≠ j, Hi ∩ Hj = {1}.
- Missing/incorrect hypotheses in the Lean code:
  - No assumption that the H i are normal subgroups.
  - No assumption that G is (internally) the direct product of the H i. Typically this entails: the multiplication map from the external product to G is a group homomorphism, surjective (or generating condition), with trivial intersections and commuting/normality conditions (depending on the chosen definition). Here there is no link between m and group multiplication at all; m is not required to be the multiplication map, nor a homomorphism, nor surjective.
  - The only structural property used is injectivity of an arbitrary function m from the product of the carriers to G, which does not capture internal direct product structure.
- Because of the above, the Lean theorem asserts a much stronger and generally false statement: that injectivity of an arbitrary map from the product of subgroup carriers to G forces pairwise trivial intersections. This is not faithful to the intended statement and is not even logically valid as a stand-in for internal direct product.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The natural statement assumes a specific group-theoretic structure (internal direct product of normal subgroups) and concludes trivial intersections. The Lean statement replaces this with an arbitrary injective function, omitting normality, multiplicative structure, and surjectivity/generation conditions, and does not ensure m is the multiplication map. Therefore the Lean code does not faithfully express the natural language theorem.

Additional notes:
- The use of sets for intersections and {1} as a set is acceptable in spirit, but the core hypotheses are missing/misstated.
- No vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced, but the hypothesis is too weak and unrelated to the internal direct product concept.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

  True := by sorry
",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- `let a := FreeGroup.of (0 : Fin 2)` and `let b := FreeGroup.of (1 : Fin 2)`: Take the free group on two generators indexed by `Fin 2`, and denote the two canonical generators by `a` and `b`.
- `let N := Subgroup.normalClosure ({a ^ 2, b ^ 2, (a * b) ^ 2} : Set (FreeGroup (Fin 2)))`: Define `N` as the normal closure of the set `{a^2, b^2, (ab)^2}` in the free group. This means we are imposing the relations `a^2 = 1`, `b^2 = 1`, and `(ab)^2 = 1` in the quotient.
- The theorem statement ends with `True := by sorry`, i.e., the theorem asserts the trivial proposition `True` and provides a placeholder proof. There is no formal claim about the quotient or an isomorphism to the quaternion group; the comment line is only a comment.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language asks to show that the quaternion group Q is presented by `⟨a, b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2⟩`. In a group presentation, the notation `a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2` usually means the relations `a^2 = b^2` and `a^2 = (ab)^2` (i.e., those words are equal), not that each of those words equals the identity. This is precisely a standard presentation of Q8.
- The Lean code instead enforces the relations `a^2 = 1`, `b^2 = 1`, and `(ab)^2 = 1` by taking the normal closure of `{a^2, b^2, (ab)^2}`. That presentation yields the Klein four group (V4), not the quaternion group. So even if the theorem had asserted the intended isomorphism, it would have been incorrect given these relations.
- Furthermore, the theorem does not actually assert any isomorphism or presentation statement at all; it merely states `True`.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Differences:
  1) The relations encoded in the Lean code are wrong for Q8: they kill `a^2`, `b^2`, `(ab)^2` individually (making them equal to 1), whereas the intended presentation equates these elements with each other, not with the identity.
  2) The theorem's content is vacuous (`True`) and does not claim the quotient is isomorphic to Q8.
- Because of these issues, the code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

To be faithful, one would need to impose relations expressing equality of words, e.g., by taking the normal closure of `{a^2 * (b^2)^{-1}, a^2 * ((a*b)^2)^{-1}}`, and then state that the resulting quotient is isomorphic to Q8.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Matrix; variable {F} [Field F]: We work over a field F with matrices from Mathlib.
- def G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2 ⊕ Fin 2) (Fin 2 ⊕ Fin 2) F) := { M | ∃ A B C, M = fromBlocks A B 0 C ∧ det (A * C) ≠ 0 }:
  This defines G as the set of 4×4 block upper-triangular matrices (with 2×2 blocks) of the form [A B; 0 C], where A,B,C are 2×2 matrices over F, and det(A*C) ≠ 0. The 4×4 matrix is indexed by Fin 2 ⊕ Fin 2 to express 2×2 block structure. This faithfully matches the natural-language definition (det(AC) ≠ 0).
- lemma one_mem_G: States that the 4×4 identity matrix belongs to G. This corresponds to taking A = I₂, B = 0, C = I₂, so det(AC) = det(I₂) ≠ 0. This is the identity-inclusion part of showing a group under multiplication.
- lemma mul_closed_G: States closure under multiplication: if X, Y ∈ G then X * Y ∈ G. This is one of the group axioms.
- lemma elements_are_units_G: States that every element of G is a unit (invertible) in the ambient ring of 4×4 matrices. This shows each element has an inverse in GL₄(F), but does not assert that the inverse lies in G.
Faithfulness check against the natural language statement:
- The definition of G exactly matches the given set: block upper-triangular with zero lower-left block and det(AC) ≠ 0. Good.
- The goal “Verify that G is a matrix group under multiplication” usually means G is a subgroup of GL₄(F): it should contain the identity, be closed under multiplication, and be closed under inverses (i.e., if X ∈ G then X⁻¹ ∈ G). The code provides identity and multiplication closure lemmas, and additionally shows each element is invertible in the ambient ring. However, it does not state or prove that inverses are in G. The lemma elements_are_units_G only asserts IsUnit X (existence of an inverse in the ring), not that X⁻¹ ∈ G.
- Therefore, while the code is close, it omits the crucial closure-under-inverses-in-G statement needed to conclude that G is a group under multiplication. It neither provides an inverse-closure lemma nor a Subgroup structure instance.
Other guideline checks:
- No vacuous placeholders are used; G is a legitimate Mathlib-based definition using fromBlocks and det. The lemmas are left as sorry (proofs omitted), which is acceptable for translation auditing as long as statements are faithful.
- The block decomposition via Fin 2 ⊕ Fin 2 is a standard, appropriate formalization.
Final comparison:
- The code nearly captures the statement but misses the inverse-closure property. Thus, it is not a fully faithful translation of “G is a matrix group under multiplication.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code: There is no Lean code provided (""Lean4 code file not found""). Therefore, there are no lines to translate and no formal statement to interpret.

We cannot verify that SL(n) is normal in GL(n) or that GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝ^× is being stated or formalized. Hence, the translation does not exist and cannot be faithful.

3) Final check comparing problems: The natural language statement is a concrete claim about groups over ℝ: SL(n) ◁ GL(n) and the quotient is isomorphic to ℝ^× (typically via the determinant map with kernel SL(n)).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: Work in an arbitrary group G.

  Natural language: In any group G, if elements a and b satisfy a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1, and b a = a^2 b (equivalently, conjugation by b sends a to a^2), then necessarily a = 1.

- `noncomputable def presentation_subgroup_is_ZMod2 (a b : G) (ha : a ^ 5 = 1) (hb : b ^ 2 = 1) (hab : b * a = a ^ 2 * b) : MulEquiv (Subgroup.closure ({a, b} : Set G)) (Multiplicative (ZMod 2)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Under the same hypotheses on a and b in G, the subgroup generated by a and b is (canonically) isomorphic as a group to Z_2 (seen multiplicatively as Multiplicative (ZMod 2)).

2) Comparison to the original statement:
- The original statement: Show that the abstract group with presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to Z_2.
- The code does not construct or reference the abstract presented group directly. Instead, it argues in any ambient group G with elements satisfying the relations. This can be a legitimate route: proving that any model of the relations generates a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 would imply the presented group is Z_2 by the universal property of presentations.
- The first theorem `presentation_a_eq_one` matches the expected algebraic deduction (indeed from bab^{-1}=a^2 and b^2=1 one can deduce a = a^4, hence a^3=1 and combined with a^5=1 get a=1). This aligns well with the intended derivation that a collapses to 1 in the presented group.
- The second declaration is the key issue: it claims that for any G and any a,b satisfying the relations, the subgroup they generate is isomorphic to Z_2. This is too strong and in general false: take G to be the trivial group with a=b=1; then the relations hold, but the subgroup generated by {a,b} is trivial, not Z_2. Thus the Lean statement overgeneralizes and becomes incorrect.
- The natural language statement only asserts that the abstract group defined by the presentation is Z_2 (i.e., there exists a model with b of order 2 and no further collapse). To faithfully formalize this, one should either:
  - Define the presented group (e.g., as a quotient of a free group) and show it isomorphic to Z_2, or
  - Phrase the parametric result with an additional nontriviality assumption on b (e.g., that b ≠ 1 or that the subgroup generated by a,b is nontrivial), or restrict to the specific model realizing the presentation.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The Lean code claims a universal isomorphism for any ambient G and any a,b satisfying the relations, which is false when b=1. The original statement makes an assertion about the abstract group defined by the presentation, not about every realization in any group; in particular, it does not claim that in every group with those relations the generated subgroup is Z_2.
  - The code does not explicitly model the presented group; it instead speaks about `Subgroup.closure {a,b}` in an arbitrary G. This approach would be acceptable if properly qualified, but as written it overstates the conclusion.
- Conclusion: Not a faithful translation due to the overstrong and incorrect generalization in the second declaration.

Other notes:
- There are no vacuous placeholder definitions; the types used are standard Mathlib concepts. The use of `sorry` is acceptable under the given auditing guidelines (no proofs required), but the type of the second declaration is itself not a faithful translation.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Load the math library.
- `theorem s5_not_solvable ( h : IsSimpleGroup (MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign : Equiv.Perm (Fin 5) →* ℤˣ) : Type _)) : ¬ IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)) := by sorry`
  This states: Assume the kernel of the sign homomorphism from the symmetric group on 5 elements, `S_5 = Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)`, to the multiplicative group of units of the integers `ℤˣ` is a simple group. Then `S_5` is not solvable. The kernel of the sign homomorphism is exactly the alternating group `A_5`, so the hypothesis is “A_5 is simple”. The conclusion is “S_5 is not solvable”.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The original statement: “Assuming that A_5 is a simple group (this was proved by Galois) show that S_5 is not a solvable group.” The Lean code encodes the assumption as `IsSimpleGroup (ker sign)` where `ker sign = A_5`, and the conclusion as `¬ IsSolvable S_5`. This matches the mathematical content precisely. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts (sign homomorphism, kernel, simple group, solvable group) are standard Mathlib notions.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- The identification `ker(sign) = A_5` is standard and is exactly the intended meaning of “A_5”. The code uses this in place of naming `A_5` explicitly, which is an exact match in context.
- No extraneous hypotheses are added; no weakening/strengthening is present.
- Therefore, the two statements are the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Polynomial IntermediateField` just bring in Mathlib and open relevant namespaces.
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem isSolvable_iff_isRadical_tac_1513 (p : ℚ[X]) (hp : Irreducible p) : IsSolvable p.Gal ↔ IsRadical p := by sorry`
  reads in natural language as: For a polynomial p over the rationals with p irreducible, the Galois group of p (namely p.Gal) is solvable if and only if p is “radical,” i.e., `IsRadical p` holds. No proof is provided (`by sorry`). There are no auxiliary definitions.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Let p(x) be an irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients, and let G = Gal(p) be its Galois group. Then the complex roots of p(x) are expressible in terms of radicals if and only if G is a solvable group.”
- The left side matches: `IsSolvable p.Gal` is exactly “G is solvable.” 
- The right side in the code is `IsRadical p`. For faithfulness, this must denote the standard field-theoretic property “the roots of p are expressible by radicals” (or equivalently, the splitting field of p is contained in a radical extension). However, the name `IsRadical` is highly ambiguous in Mathlib: it is commonly used for the property of an ideal being radical, not for a polynomial being solvable by radicals. The code provides no clarification or namespace suggesting a field-theoretic meaning (e.g., something like `SolvableByRadicals p`). Thus, unless `IsRadical p` is a Mathlib-defined predicate meaning “p is solvable by radicals,” the statement risks saying something entirely different (e.g., that the principal ideal (p) is radical/squarefree), which is not the intended meaning.
- The code does not explicitly mention “complex roots,” but if `IsRadical p` encodes solvability by radicals over ℚ (which is typically equivalent to expressibility in radicals in ℂ), this omission is harmless. The key issue remains the meaning of `IsRadical p`.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- If `IsRadical p` is indeed the Mathlib notion “p is solvable by radicals,” then the code is a faithful formalization of the statement and would deserve full marks.
- If, as is much more likely in current Mathlib naming, `IsRadical` denotes the radical property of an ideal (or any non-field-theoretic notion), then the right-hand side is not the intended “expressible by radicals” property. In that case, the code is not faithful.
- The code assumes irreducibility (which matches the natural language), uses the correct Galois group `p.Gal`, and has no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The only substantial concern is the meaning of `IsRadical p`.

Given the strong likelihood that `IsRadical p` does not mean “solvable by radicals” in Mathlib, I must mark this as not faithful, though it is very close in shape and intent.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to model the dihedral group action using matrices: take r as rotation by 2π/n and h as reflection across the horizontal axis, and prove r h r = h. The Lean code defines precisely these matrices and states the equality r * h * r = h. Using matrices is exactly the “algebraic argument with matrices” requested.
- The code includes the hypothesis n ≥ 3, which matches the problem statement (even though it is not used in the statement).
- The code does not explicitly mention the dihedral group D_n as a group object, but since the problem specifically asks for a matrix argument, encoding the matrices and their relation suffices for a faithful translation.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The equation r h r = h in the matrix setting matches the equation in the problem precisely (same symbols, same geometric meaning: rotation by 2π/n and reflection across the x-axis).
- Not formalizing D_n itself is acceptable because the problem requested a matrix argument; the essential content is the matrix identity. There are no vacuous placeholders: the matrices are genuine definitions. The presence of `sorry` is in the proof, which is allowed per the auditing criteria; the key is that the statement matches.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formal statement of the natural language problem.

- `noncomputable def rho_theta (θ : ℝ) (X : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := ... (x * Real.cos θ - y * Real.sin θ, x * Real.sin θ + y * Real.cos θ)` defines the map ρ_θ: R^2 → R^2 by the standard rotation formula: if X = (x, y), then ρ_θ(X) = (x cos θ − y sin θ, x sin θ + y cos θ). This is exactly multiplication by the 2×2 rotation matrix R_θ.
- `theorem rotation_of_R2 (θ : ℝ) (X : ℝ × ℝ) : ∃ r φ, 0 ≤ r ∧ X = (r * Real.cos φ, r * Real.sin φ) ∧ rho_theta θ X = (r * Real.cos (φ + θ), r * Real.sin (φ + θ))` states that for any θ and any vector X in R^2, there exist polar coordinates (r ≥ 0, φ) such that X = (r cos φ, r sin φ) and its image under ρ_θ is (r cos(φ+θ), r sin(φ+θ)). In other words, ρ_θ preserves the radius r and adds θ to the angle, i.e., rotates about the origin by angle θ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that ρ_θ rotates any vector X by angle θ about the origin. The theorem precisely captures this: it expresses X in polar coordinates and shows the image has the same radius and angle increased by θ. This is the standard characterization of a rotation about the origin.
- The definition of ρ_θ matches the given matrix R_θ. Working in ℝ × ℝ for ℝ^2 is standard.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous placeholders are used; the only auxiliary definition is the explicit, correct rotation formula.
- The theorem uses an existential form via polar coordinates, which is a faithful way to formalize “rotate by θ about the origin.” Edge cases (like X = 0) are handled since r = 0 works.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per instructions we assess the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem symmetric_group_generated_by_transposition_and_cycle (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :` asserts for any natural number n with 2 ≤ n, there exists a permutation `sigma : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` such that
  `Subgroup.closure ({Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n (by decide) 0), sigma} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)))`.
  In words: there exists some permutation sigma of Fin n so that the subgroup generated by the two elements in the set `{Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n (by decide) 0), sigma}` equals the whole symmetric group on Fin n.

Comments on specific pieces:
- `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` models the symmetric group S_n on the n-element type Fin n, which corresponds to {0, …, n-1}. This indexing shift (0-based vs 1-based) is standard and acceptable.
- `Subgroup.closure { … } = ⊤` says the subgroup generated by the given set is the whole group; this matches the idea of ""generated by"".
- However, `Equiv.swap` requires two arguments (the two elements to be swapped). The code only supplies one argument, `Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n (by decide) 0)`, leaving it partially applied. As written, that expression is not of type `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, so the set is ill-typed. Intended was presumably `Equiv.swap (0 : Fin n) (1 : Fin n)`. This is a red flag for compilation/typing.
- The theorem quantifies `∃ sigma : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), …` but does not impose any condition that `sigma` is the n-cycle `(1 2 3 … n)` (or even an n-cycle). The informal comment mentions an n-cycle, but the formal statement does not encode this.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: “Let n ≥ 2. Prove that S_n is generated by the two elements S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,…,n)}.” This asserts that the specific transposition (1 2) and the specific n-cycle (1 2 … n) generate S_n.
- The Lean theorem only asserts the existence of some permutation `sigma` such that together with a transposition (intended to be (0 1)) they generate the full group. It does not assert that `sigma` is the specific n-cycle (or even an n-cycle). Thus it is strictly weaker and does not capture the named generating set.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Major difference: The code does not specify that `sigma` is the n-cycle `(1 2 3 … n)`. It merely asserts existence of some sigma, making the statement substantially weaker than the intended one.
- Another issue: The first generator is incorrectly written with only one argument to `Equiv.swap`, so the code as given is ill-typed. Assuming the intended transposition is `(0 1)`, the 0–1 indexing shift from `(1,2)` to `(0,1)` is acceptable as a formalization detail.

Given these issues, the Lean code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem orthogonal_columns (n : ℕ) (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) (h : A.transpose * A = 1) :` sets up: for a natural number n and a real n×n matrix A, assume Aᵀ A = I (the identity matrix). This is exactly the orthogonality condition characterizing O(n).
- `∀ i j : Fin n, ∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j = if i = j then 1 else 0` states: for all indices i, j among the n columns, the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. The expression `∑ k A k i * A k j` is the dot product of the i-th and j-th column vectors of A. The right-hand side `if i = j then 1 else 0` is the Kronecker delta δ_ij. This is exactly the statement that the columns are orthonormal.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language says: A ∈ O(n), with columns A₁,...,Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ, show A_i · A_j = δ_{ij}. In Lean, A ∈ O(n) is represented by `A.transpose * A = 1`. The dot product of the i-th and j-th columns is represented by the sum over k of coordinate-wise products `∑ k, A k i * A k j`. The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is represented by `if i = j then 1 else 0`. Thus the Lean statement is a direct formalization.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- Indexing: the natural language uses indices 1..n; Lean uses `Fin n` (0..n-1). This is a standard formalization detail with no mathematical discrepancy.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement stands on standard Mathlib notions (matrices, transpose, identity, sums).
- Therefore, the Lean theorem faithfully translates the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem unique_subgroup_of_order_normal {G : Type _} [Group G] {H : Subgroup G} {n : Nat}`: We are in a group G, with a subgroup H and a natural number n.
- `(H_fintype : Fintype (H : Set G))`: Assume H is finite (the underlying set of H has a fintype structure).
- `(uniq : ∀ (K : Subgroup G) [Fintype (K : Set G)], Fintype.card (K : Set G) = n → K = H)`: Assume that any subgroup K of G which is finite and has cardinality n must equal H. This encodes the uniqueness of the subgroup of order n, but only as a universal property about K; it does not assert that H itself has order n.
- `: ∀ g : G, Subgroup.map (MulAut.conj g) H = H`: The conclusion is that for every g in G, the conjugate of H by g equals H. This is an equivalent formulation of H being normal in G.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “If H is a subgroup of order n in a group G and H is the only subgroup of order n, then H is normal in G.” This has two hypotheses: (i) H has order n (i.e., |H| = n), and (ii) H is the unique subgroup of order n.
- The Lean hypotheses encode (ii) correctly: any finite subgroup K with card n must be equal to H. However, the code never states (i) that H itself has order n. It only assumes H is finite via `H_fintype`, but it does not include `Fintype.card (H : Set G) = n`.
- The conclusion in Lean (`∀ g, Subgroup.map (MulAut.conj g) H = H`) is an equivalent formulation of normality, so that part matches well.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- They are not exactly the same. The Lean statement is missing the assumption that H has order n. The natural language statement includes it explicitly. Without `Fintype.card (H : Set G) = n`, the Lean theorem as stated is strictly weaker in hypotheses (it only requires H to be finite and that any subgroup of order n equals H, without guaranteeing H has order n). This is a meaningful discrepancy, since the intended proof relies on the equality of orders between H and its conjugates to apply the uniqueness assumption.
- Everything else (expression of uniqueness, and the conclusion expressing normality) is appropriate.

Therefore, the code is very close but not fully faithful: it omits the crucial hypothesis that |H| = n. A faithful version would add `Fintype.card (H : Set G) = n` (or equivalently `Fintype H` and `Fintype.card H = n`).

  This asserts: For the same n, a, b, c, the equality ([b] + [c]) * [a] = [b]*[a] + [c]*[a] holds in ZMod n.

2) Whole translation assessment:
- The natural language statement fixes an integer n > 1 and asks to show left and right distributivity of multiplication over addition for congruence classes modulo n of arbitrary integers a, b, c. The code models n as a natural number with the hypothesis 1 < n, which is equivalent to n being an integer > 1 in this context. It quantifies over a, b, c : Int and uses the canonical coercion to ZMod n, which corresponds to the notation [x]. The equalities stated are exactly the distributivity laws requested. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; ZMod is Mathlib's standard modulo ring.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only slight difference is that the code uses n : ℕ with 1 < n, rather than n ∈ ℤ with n > 1. Since n > 1 implies n is a positive integer and standardly ZMod is taken for natural moduli, this is a faithful formalization.
- The hypotheses are slightly stronger than necessary (distributivity holds for all n, even n = 0 or 1), but the natural language explicitly fixes n > 1, so the code matches or slightly specializes.
- Both left and right distributivity are stated exactly as in the natural language.
No discrepancies affecting faithfulness.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language statement.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def O_group := LinearIsometryEquiv.ofReal (Fin n → ℝ)`
  Natural language: Define O(n) as `LinearIsometryEquiv.ofReal (Fin n → ℝ)`. This is labeled as a placeholder. In Mathlib, the orthogonal group is typically modeled as linear isometric equivalences on Euclidean space (or as the matrix orthogonal group). The identifier `LinearIsometryEquiv.ofReal` is not a standard way to define O(n), and this definition is opaque and almost certainly not the intended object. It's a placeholder rather than a faithful definition of O(n).

- `def SO_group := {g : O_group n // 1 = 1}`
  Natural language: Define SO(n) as the subtype of elements of O(n) satisfying the condition `1 = 1`. This condition is trivially true for all elements, so this defines SO(n) = O(n) as a set. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not encode the usual determinant = 1 condition for the special orthogonal group.

- `theorem SO_normal_in_O : (SO_group n).Normal := by sorry`
  Natural language: Claim that SO(n) is normal. However, `Normal` is a property of a subgroup of a group, whereas `SO_group n` here is a subtype, not a `Subgroup (O_group n)`. This is a type mismatch conceptually. Even ignoring typing, since `SO_group n` was defined as the whole group, the statement would reduce to “O(n) is normal in O(n)”, which is true but not the intended statement.

- `theorem O_mod_SO_eq_units : (O_group n) ⧸ (SO_group n) ≃* (Multiplicative (Units (Int))) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Claim that O(n)/SO(n) is isomorphic as a multiplicative group to Z^×. However, given the placeholder `SO_group n = O_group n`, the quotient would be trivial, not Z^×. Additionally, the quotient notation `G ⧸ H` expects `H` to be a `Subgroup G`, which `SO_group n` is not. Also, the target `Multiplicative (Units Int)` is odd: `Units ℤ` is already a multiplicative group; wrapping it in `Multiplicative` is unnecessary and likely incorrect.

Faithfulness check against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is: prove SO(n) is normal in O(n) and that the quotient O(n)/SO(n) is isomorphic to Z^× = {±1}. A faithful formalization would define O(n) as the orthogonal group over ℝ, define SO(n) as the determinant-1 subgroup, then state the normality and the quotient isomorphism to `Units ℤ`.
- The code uses placeholders for both O(n) and SO(n). SO(n) is defined by a vacuous predicate `1 = 1`, so it equals O(n). Therefore, the conclusions in the code (even if type-correct) would not match the mathematical content: the quotient would be trivial rather than Z^×. Moreover, the code does not use Mathlib’s actual notions for O(n), SO(n), subgroup normality, or quotient.

Final comparison:
- The code does not faithfully formalize the statement. It employs vacuous placeholder definitions, and the resulting theorems, if taken at face value, would assert something different (trivial quotient) or are ill-typed. Thus, this is not a faithful translation.

Grading rationale:
- Vacuous placeholders are used for key definitions (O_group, SO_group). Even if these were replaced properly, the intended theorems would then be on the right track, but as written they are not faithful. According to the rubric, this merits a low score. Because fixing the placeholders could in principle make the final theorem faithful, I would put this closer to 3–6. Given additional issues (wrong target type wrapper, subgroup vs subtype issues), I assign 3.

  Defines the permutation matrix associated to a permutation σ of {0,…,n−1} (Fin n). The entry (i,j) is 1 exactly when i = σ j, and 0 otherwise. This matches the description “obtained by permuting the columns of the identity by σ”: the j-th column has its 1 in row σ j.

  Predicate that A is a permutation matrix: entries are 0 or 1, exactly one 1 per row, and exactly one 1 per column.
- `def perm_group_equiv : (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ≃ { A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F // is_perm_matrix A } := by sorry`:
  States there is a bijection (equivalence of types) between the symmetric group on n elements (as permutations of Fin n) and the set of permutation matrices (as a subtype of all n×n matrices over F), via σ ↦ perm_matrix σ. Proof omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- The natural language statement asks to prove that S_n is isomorphic as a group to the subgroup of permutation matrices inside GL_n(F), via α ↦ P_α.
- The code provides only a bijection of underlying sets between permutations and matrices satisfying the permutation-matrix predicate. It does not:
  - Place these matrices inside GL_n(F) (the group of invertible matrices),
  - Equip the target with a group structure or identify it as a subgroup of GL_n(F),
  - State or prove that the map is a group homomorphism (so a group isomorphism, not just a bijection).
- The definition of is_perm_matrix matches the “equivalently” characterization of permutation matrices in the statement, and perm_matrix matches the “apply σ to columns” convention.

Step 3: Final check — same or different?
- Different. The code asserts only a bijection of sets between S_n and the set of permutation matrices, not a group isomorphism with the subgroup of GL_n(F). It also does not place the matrices in GL_n(F) as a subgroup. Thus it misses the essential group-structure part of the statement.

Verdict: The translation is close but not faithful to the group-theoretic content (no subgroup of GL_n(F), no group isomorphism, only a set-level equivalence).

- def perm_matrix (p : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F := fun i j => if p i = j then 1 else 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For G a group, n ∈ ℕ, F a field, any permutation representation δ: G → S_n gives rise to a matrix representation ρ: G → GL_n(F) by g ↦ P_{δ(g)}. This emphasizes that ρ lands in GL_n(F) (the general linear group), i.e., invertible matrices, and ρ is a group hom.
- The Lean code constructs ρ as a monoid hom into Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F, i.e., into all n×n matrices over F, not explicitly into GL_n(F). While permutation matrices are invertible and thus do land in GL_n(F), the theorem’s codomain is the full matrix monoid, not GL_n(F). The statement does not assert invertibility or that the image lies in the general linear group. So the codomain in the Lean theorem is weaker and does not match the GL_n(F) target.
- The source δ is modeled as a monoid hom into Equiv.Perm (Fin n), which is acceptable for a group hom into S_n (groups are monoids, and MonoidHom is standard in Mathlib for group homs).
- The concrete definition of the permutation matrix entries is consistent with standard conventions, and the pointwise formula ρ g = perm_matrix (δ g) is as in the statement.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Same: G a group, n natural, F a field; δ: G → S_n; ρ defined pointwise by permutation matrices; ρ is a homomorphism.
- Difference: The natural language requires ρ: G → GL_n(F), i.e., a group hom into the general linear group. The Lean code instead gives ρ: G →* Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F, i.e., into the monoid of all matrices, without asserting (or even typing) that the image lies in GL_n(F). This is a meaningful mismatch: the target structure is weaker and does not express that ρ(g) is invertible or that ρ is a hom into a group.
- No vacuous placeholders: perm_matrix is a genuine definition; there are no fake predicates. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation checking.

Conclusion: The translation is close but not faithful due to the codomain mismatch (Matrix vs GL_n(F)).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Definition `rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := ...` defines the map ρ_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 given by the standard rotation matrix of angle θ: (x, y) ↦ (cos θ · x − sin θ · y, sin θ · x + cos θ · y). This is the usual rotation of the plane by angle θ.
- Theorem `rho_add (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : (rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2) = rho (θ1 + θ2)` states that composing the rotation by θ2 followed by the rotation by θ1 equals the rotation by θ1 + θ2; i.e., ρ_{θ1} ∘ ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2}.
- Theorem `rho_inverse_comp (θ : ℝ) : (rho θ) ∘ (rho (-θ)) = id ∧ (rho (-θ)) ∘ (rho θ) = id` states that rotation by −θ is a two-sided inverse of rotation by θ (both left and right inverses), i.e., ρ_θ ∘ ρ_{−θ} = id and ρ_{−θ} ∘ ρ_θ = id. This is equivalent to saying (ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{−θ}.
- Theorem `rho_comm (θ1 θ2 : ℝ) : (rho θ1) ∘ (rho θ2) = (rho θ2) ∘ (rho θ1)` states that rotations commute under composition: ρ_{θ1} ∘ ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ2} ∘ ρ_{θ1}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The first part “for all θ1, θ2 ∈ ℝ, ρ_{θ1} ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2}” is exactly captured by `rho_add` with composition written as ∘.
- The second part “(ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{−θ}” is expressed by `rho_inverse_comp` via the two identities that characterize inverse functions; this is an equivalent formalization in Lean since inverse of a function is captured by two-sided inverse equalities.
- The “in particular, rotations commute” is stated directly as `rho_comm` and matches the natural language conclusion.
- The definition of ρ_θ is the standard rotation on ℝ^2, matching the intended meaning of ρ_θ.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only stylistic difference is expressing “inverse” via two composition-to-identity equalities rather than using an inverse notation; this is completely equivalent in this context.
- No auxiliary vacuous placeholders are used; `rho` is a concrete, correct definition. The theorems are statements without proofs (admitted by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- Imports and opens: Standard Mathlib imports and namespace openings; nothing problematic.
- Theorem statement:
  theorem quotient_triangle_ext {G : Type*} [Group G] {H K : Subgroup G} (hH : H.Normal) (hK : K.Normal)

  Natural language reading:
  - Let G be a group, H and K subgroups with H and K normal in G, and H ≤ K.
  - Conclusion:
    (i) (K ⧸ H) ≤ (G ⧸ H). This reads as: the quotient K/H is a subgroup of G/H (expressed via ≤, the inclusion relation on subgroups).
    (ii) (G ⧸ H) ⧸ (K ⧸ H) ≃* G ⧸ K, i.e., an isomorphism of groups between the iterated quotient (G/H)/(K/H) and G/K.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Original: If H ◁ G, K ◁ G, and H ⊆ K, then (K/H) ◁ (G/H) and (G/H)/(K/H) ≅ G/K.
- The first part requires: K/H is normal in G/H.
- The code asserts instead: (K ⧸ H) ≤ (G ⧸ H), i.e., inclusion/subgroup relation, not normality. This is a different and strictly weaker/different claim. Moreover, (K ⧸ H) and (G ⧸ H) are both types (quotient groups), not subgroups of a common ambient group, so writing ≤ between them is not the correct formalization. Faithfulness fails here.
- The second part: (G/H)/(K/H) ≅ G/K matches the intended third isomorphism theorem, but the code uses (K ⧸ H) directly as the second argument to ⧸, whereas in Mathlib the second argument of ⧸ must be a Subgroup of the first group (here a Subgroup of G ⧸ H). The correct formalization would involve the image of K in G/H, e.g., K.map (QuotientGroup.mk _), not the type K ⧸ H. So even syntactically/semantically this is not the right object, and it obscures the necessary normality statement.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. Differences:
  - Normality vs inclusion: The original requires (K/H) ◁ (G/H); the code states (K/H) ≤ (G/H), which is not the same and not even well-typed as a relation between quotient groups.
  - Misuse of (K ⧸ H) in the quotient (G ⧸ H) ⧸ (K ⧸ H): the second argument must be a Subgroup of (G ⧸ H), namely the image of K in G/H, not the quotient group K/H. The code skips this and thus does not faithfully represent the statement.
  - Consequently, the code neither correctly states the normality part nor correctly types the double quotient part.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful to the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: We use Mathlib's group theory framework.
- The theorem `subgroup_closure_of_index_two` states: For any group `G`, any subgroup `H` of `G`, and any element `a : G`, if the index of `H` in `G` is 2 (i.e., `H.index = 2`) and `a` is not in `H` (`a ∉ H`), then the subgroup generated by the union of `H` (viewed as a set of elements) and the singleton `{a}` is the whole group `G`. In Lean terms, this is expressed as `Subgroup.closure ((H : Set G) ∪ ({a} : Set G)) = ⊤`.
- There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; it’s a direct theorem statement. The use of `sorry` is acceptable here since we are auditing the statement, not the proof.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: Let `O(2)` be the group of real 2×2 orthogonal matrices, `SO(2)` the subgroup of rotations. Prove that `O(2)` is generated by `SO(2) ∪ {A}` for any fixed improper orthogonal matrix `A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2)`.
- Interpreting the math: `SO(2)` is an index 2 subgroup of `O(2)`, and an “improper orthogonal matrix” is exactly an element of `O(2)` with determinant `-1`, i.e., not in `SO(2)`. The claim is that the subgroup generated by `SO(2)` together with any such `A` equals `O(2)`.
- Mapping to the Lean theorem: take `G = O(2)`, `H = SO(2)`, and `a = A`. Then `H.index = 2` is a known fact, and `a ∉ H` encodes that `A` is improper. The conclusion `Subgroup.closure ((H : Set G) ∪ {a}) = ⊤` is exactly “the subgroup generated by `SO(2) ∪ {A}` is the whole group `O(2)`.”

3) Final check: same or different?
- The Lean theorem is a general group-theoretic statement that directly specializes to the desired fact about `O(2)` and `SO(2)`. There are no extraneous hypotheses beyond the index-2 condition and `a ∉ H`, which match the natural assumptions. The formalization uses standard Mathlib notions (`Subgroup.index`, `Subgroup.closure`, `⊤`) and no placeholders.
- Therefore, the code is a faithful (indeed slightly more general) translation of the natural-language statement.

  3) IsSimpleGroupOfLieType G (placeholder prop), or
  4) IsSporadicSimpleGroup G (placeholder prop).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language statement: Every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of:
- cyclic of prime order,
- alternating group An for n ≥ 5,
- a simple group of Lie type (classical, exceptional and twisted),
- one of the 26 sporadic groups.

Discrepancies:
- The first branch in Lean asserts only that |G| = p (for p prime). The natural statement requires that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p. Given the global hypothesis that G is simple, |G| = p implies G is cyclic of order p, but the Lean statement does not explicitly express the isomorphism to the canonical cyclic group (e.g., ZMod p or CyclicGroup p). This weakens the explicit isomorphism claim.
- The second branch uses Nonempty (G ≃ AlternatingGroup n), which is an equivalence of types (a bijection of underlying sets), not a group isomorphism (G ≃* AlternatingGroup n). This fails to encode the group isomorphism required by the natural language statement.
- AlternatingGroup is introduced as an axiomatically given Type without a group structure, rather than using mathlib’s definition (alternating subgroup of permutations) or any structured presentation. This is a placeholder and not a legitimate mathlib concept as used.
- The Lie type and sporadic alternatives are encoded as opaque predicates IsSimpleGroupOfLieType and IsSporadicSimpleGroup, which have no definitions. They do not state isomorphism to a specific group, only membership in an unspecified property. This deviates from the natural language statement that says “is isomorphic to one of these groups.”
- These auxiliary notions are not mathlib’s standard terms and are not defined; they are axioms (placeholders). This is a major red flag per the guidelines.

Step 3: Final check
The mathematical problems are not the same. The code:
- uses non-structural type equivalence instead of group isomorphism in the alternating case,
- does not assert isomorphism to the cyclic group in the prime-order case,
- uses opaque, undefined predicates for the Lie type and sporadic cases instead of concrete isomorphism classes,
- and introduces non-mathlib placeholders via axioms.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful. Even if one were to interpret the intent, the lack of group isomorphisms and the use of opaque placeholders mean the formal statement does not match the natural language classification theorem. If the placeholders were replaced with legitimate mathlib definitions and the isomorphisms corrected (use ≃* and a canonical cyclic group), then it could be faithful; as written, it is not.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code fixes a natural number n and a real n×n matrix A: `A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Real`.
- The hypothesis `h : Matrix.transpose A * A = 1` states that A is orthogonal (Aᵀ A = I), with 1 denoting the identity matrix. This corresponds to A ∈ O(n) over the reals.
- The conclusion `∀ i j : Fin n, (∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j) = if i = j then 1 else 0` says: for all column indices i, j, the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals 1 if i = j, and 0 otherwise. Here `A k i` is the (k,i) entry of A, and the sum over k is exactly the dot product of the i-th and j-th columns.
- Thus, the conclusion is that the (i,j) entry of Aᵀ A equals δ_ij, i.e., the dot product of column i with column j is δ_ij.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let A ∈ O(n) with columns A_1, ..., A_n ∈ R^n. Show that A_i^T A_j = δ_{ij} for all 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n.
- The code’s hypothesis matches A ∈ O(n) (Aᵀ A = I) over the reals.
- The code’s conclusion matches A_i^T A_j = δ_{ij}, since `(∑ k A k i * A k j)` is the coordinate expression of the dot product of columns i and j, and `if i = j then 1 else 0` is δ_{ij}.
- Indexing via `Fin n` instead of {1, ..., n} is a standard formalization choice and does not change the meaning.
- The code is slightly more explicit (gives the coordinate form) but is mathematically identical to the desired statement.

Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.
- No mismatch in domains (we are over R as in the statement). The n = 0 edge case is allowed in Lean but does not conflict with the statement’s intent.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This states: Let f be a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers. If f satisfies the functional equation f(z + w) = f(z) f(w) for all complex z, w, and f(0) = 1, then for every complex z, f(z) ≠ 0.

- `theorem exp_ne_zero (z : Complex) : Complex.exp z ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, the complex exponential exp z is nonzero. This is the “in particular” consequence that the exponential never vanishes.

2) Overall faithfulness:
The natural language statement asks to use e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 ≠ 0 to show e^z ≠ 0 for all complex z, and restates this as a general functional-equation fact: if f satisfies f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1, then f(z)≠0 for all z. The first theorem precisely formalizes this general statement for f : ℂ → ℂ, and the second formalizes the particular case for the complex exponential. This matches exactly the intended mathematical content.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not explicitly assume 1 ≠ 0, but since the codomain is Complex, 1 ≠ 0 is a known fact in Mathlib and does not need to be a hypothesis. The hypothesis f(0) = 1 suffices together with the functional equation to deduce nonvanishing. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are present; no placeholders like `:= True` are used. The statements align with Mathlib conventions (`Complex.exp`).
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- def G'_is_group : Group (Subtype fun M : Matrix ... => M ∈ G') := by sorry.
  Natural language: This declares the existence of a group structure on the subtype consisting of matrices in G'. However, it does not specify what the group operation is. The docstring claims “under matrix multiplication,” but the type merely asserts that some Group structure exists on the subtype; it does not enforce that the multiplication coincides with the restriction of matrix multiplication.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
The original statement is: Prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication. This specifically means the group operation is the inherited matrix multiplication, identity is the identity matrix (which belongs to G'), and inverses are the usual matrix inverses (or, more precisely, that every element of G' is invertible and the inverse stays in G').

The Lean declaration G'_is_group only states that there is a Group structure on the subtype of matrices in G'. It does not tie this structure to the ambient matrix multiplication. In Lean, the more faithful way would be to define or instantiate the Group structure with multiplication x*y := ⟨x.1 ⬝ y.1, ...⟩, one := ⟨1, ...⟩, inv := ⟨x.1⁻¹, ...⟩, along with proofs. As written, the statement is strictly weaker and could denote any (even unrelated) group structure on this type.

Step 3: Are the two problems the same?
They are not exactly the same. The math problem asserts G' is a group with the specific operation of matrix multiplication. The Lean code asserts only that there exists a group structure on G' (without constraining it to be the restriction of matrix multiplication). Hence, the code does not faithfully encode “under matrix multiplication.”

Other checks:
- The definitions of G and G' are correct and non-vacuous.
- The presence of `by sorry` is used only to omit the proof/structure data; that’s acceptable for the purpose of statement translation. The main issue is not the sorry but the missing stipulation that the group operation is matrix multiplication.

Conclusion: The translation is close but fails to guarantee the key phrase “under matrix multiplication,” so it is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Real`, `open Matrix`: bring in real numbers and matrix utilities.
- `def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix function R(θ). The entry-wise definition yields the matrix [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]], i.e., the standard rotation matrix by angle θ.

The entry-wise definition gives [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), -cos(2θ)]], which is the standard formula for reflection across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis (indeed H(θ) = R(θ) diag(1, -1) R(−θ)).
- `theorem O2_eq : (Matrix.orthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)) = {M | ∃ θ : ℝ, M = R θ} ∪ {M | ∃ θ : ℝ, M = H θ} := by sorry` states that the set of 2×2 real orthogonal matrices equals the union of the set of all rotations R(θ) and the set of all reflections H(θ). The coercion `(Matrix.orthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ : Set (Matrix ...))` treats O(2) as the set of 2×2 real matrices satisfying AᵀA = I.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is exactly that O(2) equals the union of rotations R_θ and reflections H_θ across lines at angle θ. The Lean code defines R and H with the standard formulas and asserts the set equality. This is precisely the same claim.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The definitions of R and H are standard and correctly match rotation by θ and reflection across the line at angle θ.
- The left-hand side denotes O(2) as the set of 2×2 real orthogonal matrices. The right-hand side is the union of {R_θ} and {H_θ} over θ ∈ ℝ.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `theorem congruence_refl (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) (a : Int) : Int.ModEq n a a := by sorry`
  This states: For any integer n with n > 0 and any integer a, a is congruent to a modulo n (reflexivity). Here `Int.ModEq n a a` is the standard notion “a ≡ a (mod n)”.

- `theorem congruence_symm (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) {a b : Int} (h : Int.ModEq n a b) : Int.ModEq n b a := by sorry`
  This states: For any integer n with n > 0 and integers a, b, if a ≡ b (mod n), then b ≡ a (mod n) (symmetry).

- `theorem congruence_trans (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) {a b c : Int} (hab : Int.ModEq n a b) (hbc : Int.ModEq n b c) : Int.ModEq n a c := by sorry`
  This states: For any integer n with n > 0 and integers a, b, c, if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n) (transitivity).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement
- The natural language statement assumes a fixed positive integer n and integers a, b, c, and then asserts reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of congruence modulo n. The Lean code uses `Int.ModEq n a b` which is mathlib’s standard definition of congruence modulo n for integers. Each theorem includes the hypothesis `hn : 0 < n`, matching “n is a fixed positive integer”. The three properties correspond exactly to reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Domain: The code uses `n : Int` with `0 < n` rather than `n : Nat` with `n > 0`. This is a harmless formalization; a positive integer in ℤ is equivalent to a positive natural mapped into ℤ.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given (proofs are elided with `sorry`, which is acceptable per instructions).
- Thus, the code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

The natural language asks to show R_{2θ} H0 R_{2θ} = H0 for all θ, with the given definitions of H0 and R_{2θ}. The Lean code defines exactly those matrices and states exactly that identity for all θ. The term “Conjugating” in the comment is a slight misnomer (since conjugation would normally use R^{-1}), but the formal theorem statement matches the requested identity precisely.

They are the same: same matrices, same parameter θ (with the rotation at angle 2θ), and the same equality R_{2θ} H0 R_{2θ} = H0 for all θ ∈ ℝ. No auxiliary vacuous placeholders; H0 and R2 are fully specified. The theorem uses sorry for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing. Hence, the translation is faithful.

- theorem H_theta_eq (θ : ℝ) : H θ = H0 * R (-2 * θ) := by sorry.
  This states that for each real θ, H θ equals the matrix product H0 times R at angle −2θ.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The statement says: For each θ ∈ ℝ, H_θ = H_0 R_{−2θ}, with H_0 = [[1,0],[0,−1]] and R_φ = [[cos φ, −sin φ], [sin φ, cos φ]]. The Lean code defines H0 and R exactly as in the statement. It also defines H θ explicitly as [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), −cos(2θ)]], which matches the product H0 R_{−2θ} (since R_{−2θ} = [[cos 2θ, sin 2θ], [−sin 2θ, cos 2θ]] and multiplying by H0 flips the sign of the second row). The theorem H_theta_eq thus exactly asserts H θ = H0 * R (−2θ), identical to the natural language claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- Order of multiplication and angle sign agree: H0 * R(−2θ) matches H_0 R_{−2θ}.
- Definitions of H0 and R are faithful.
- H θ is defined consistently with the claimed identity.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions. The presence of `sorry` in the proof does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U, show f is locally injective on U.
- The Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability only on U (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U), which is the standard formalization of a function defined on an open subset; it matches “holomorphic on U.”
- The derivative condition is exactly captured by `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`.
- The conclusion precisely formalizes “locally injective on U” as existence of an open neighborhood V of each z, with V ⊆ U, on which f is injective.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. The Lean formulation generalizes slightly by taking f defined on all ℂ and restricting to U via DifferentiableOn and InjOn on V ⊆ U; this is a standard and faithful formalization. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. No extra unintended conditions are added. The inclusion of IsOpen V and V ⊆ U exactly captures the local injectivity within U.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix indexed by `Fin 2` × `Fin 2`. The entries are given by a case split:
  - If `(i, j) = (0, 0)`, the entry is `Real.cos θ`.
  - If `(i, j) = (0, 1)`, the entry is `- Real.sin θ`.
  - If `(i, j) = (1, 0)`, the entry is `Real.sin θ`.
  - Otherwise (which must be `(1, 1)`), the entry is `Real.cos θ`.
  Thus R(θ) is exactly the 2×2 matrix [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]].

- `theorem R_theta_in_SO2 (θ : ℝ) : Matrix.transpose (R θ) * R θ = 1 ∧ Matrix.det (R θ) = 1 := by sorry`
  This asserts, for each real θ, that the matrix R(θ) satisfies two properties: (i) `R(θ)^T R(θ) = I` (orthogonality), and (ii) `det R(θ) = 1` (special). Here `1` denotes the identity matrix of size 2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: show that the matrix R_θ = [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]] belongs to SO(2) for every real θ. In standard mathematics, SO(2) is the group of 2×2 real orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. The Lean theorem states exactly the defining conditions of membership in SO(2): orthogonality (`A^T A = I`) and determinant 1, for the specific matrix R(θ) and for all θ. Although it does not use a specific `SO(2)` type from Mathlib, it encodes the equivalent defining properties directly. The definition of R(θ) matches the given matrix.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code defines the correct rotation matrix and asserts the two properties that characterize SO(2). This is a faithful translation of “R_θ ∈ SO(2) for all θ”.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; `R` is concrete. The theorem is stated with the correct target properties. The use of `sorry` does not affect faithfulness of the statement.
- Minor stylistic difference: the statement does not explicitly mention the `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` type, but uses the equivalent property-based characterization. This is acceptable and faithful.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U is open; f : U → ℂ is holomorphic; if |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U, then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
- Holomorphicity: Lean uses `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, which is the standard formalization of holomorphic on U. This matches the intention.
- Local maximum: The natural language means a local maximum relative to U (since f is only defined on U). The Lean code assumes `IsLocalMax` on the ambient domain ℂ for the function z ↦ |f z|, which is a stronger assumption because f is extended to all of ℂ. Since U is open and z0 ∈ U, an ambient local maximum implies a local maximum relative to U. Thus the Lean hypothesis is a slight strengthening/specialization but consistent with the statement.
- Conclusion: The Lean conclusion that f is constant on some open neighborhood s of z0 contained in U matches “f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.”

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions (`IsOpen`, `DifferentiableOn`, `IsLocalMax`, `Complex.abs`). The only discrepancy is the ambient vs relative notion of local maximum due to f being defined on ℂ rather than U, which is a common and acceptable formalization; it yields a slightly stronger hypothesis but an equivalent conclusion in context. Therefore the translation is faithful up to this mild specialization.

- `theorem complex_abs_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re := by sorry`: This declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number `z` asserting that the modulus of the complex exponential `exp z` equals the real exponential of the real part of `z`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For `z ∈ ℂ`, prove `|e^z| = e^{Re z}`. The Lean statement is exactly: For all `z : ℂ`, `Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re`. This matches perfectly in meaning and scope.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a direct theorem statement reflecting the original claim.

3) Final check:
- The two statements are the same: both assert the equality of the modulus of the complex exponential and the exponential of the real part, for an arbitrary complex number `z`.
- No discrepancies in quantification, generality, or definitions.

Therefore, the translation is fully faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`, `open Complex`, `open Matrix`: Use Mathlib with Complex numbers and Matrix operations.
- Lemma `complex_2x2_matrix_eigenpairs (a b : ℝ) : ...` declares real parameters a, b.
- `let M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ := ...` defines a 2×2 complex matrix with entries
  M = [[a, -b], [b, a]], where a and b are embedded into ℂ via `ofReal`. Formally, for indices i,j ∈ Fin 2, M i j =
  - if i = 0 and j = 0: ofReal a
  - if i = 0 and j ≠ 0: - ofReal b
  - if i ≠ 0 and j = 0: ofReal b
  - if i ≠ 0 and j ≠ 0: ofReal a.
  This is the standard real matrix representing multiplication by a + i b, viewed over ℂ.
- `let v1 : Fin 2 → ℂ := fun i => if i = 0 then 1 else -I`: defines the vector v1 = [1, -i]^T.
- `let v2 : Fin 2 → ℂ := fun i => if i = 0 then 1 else I`: defines the vector v2 = [1, i]^T.
- The goal statement: `M.mulVec v1 = (ofReal a + I * ofReal b) • v1 ∧ M.mulVec v2 = (ofReal a - I * ofReal b) • v2` asserts two eigenpair equations:
  - v1 is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue a + i b.
  - v2 is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue a − i b.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If the 2×2 matrix M represents the complex number a+ib (i.e., M = [[a, -b], [b, a]]), then M has eigenvalues a ± i b with corresponding eigenvectors [1; ∓ i].
- The Lean lemma constructs exactly that M (up to embedding the real entries into ℂ), and explicitly presents the eigenvector equations for [1, -i]^T and [1, i]^T with eigenvalues a + i b and a − i b, respectively. This matches the correspondence [1; ∓ i].

3) Final check for differences:
- The original statement likely views M as a real 2×2 matrix; the code treats M as a complex 2×2 matrix whose entries are real numbers embedded into ℂ. This is a harmless and standard adjustment since eigenvalues/vectors are complex anyway; it preserves the intended meaning.
- The code asserts the exact eigenpair equalities and hence that both a ± i b are eigenvalues with the stated eigenvectors. No extraneous or vacuous definitions are used. No placeholders beyond `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def rho (θ : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := (x.1 * Real.cos θ - x.2 * Real.sin θ, x.1 * Real.sin θ + x.2 * Real.cos θ)`
  This defines ρ_θ(x) as the standard action of the 2×2 rotation matrix [ [cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ] ] on x = (x₁, x₂). So ρ is the usual rotation by angle θ in the plane ℝ².
- `def inner2 (x y : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ := x.1 * y.1 + x.2 * y.2`
  This defines the standard Euclidean inner product on ℝ².
- `noncomputable def norm2 (x : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ := Real.sqrt (inner2 x x)`
  This defines the Euclidean norm induced by `inner2`.
- The theorem:
  `theorem inner_rho_eq_cos (θ : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ) (hx : x ≠ (0, 0)) : inner2 x (rho θ x) = norm2 x * norm2 (rho θ x) * Real.cos θ`
  This states that for any real θ and any nonzero vector x in ℝ², the inner product of x and ρ_θ(x) equals the product of their norms times cos θ.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: For any θ ∈ ℝ and any nonzero X ∈ ℝ², the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ (hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ).
- In standard Euclidean geometry, the (unsigned) angle α between two nonzero vectors u,v is defined via cos α = ⟪u,v⟫/(‖u‖‖v‖). The Lean theorem exactly encodes ⟪x, ρ_θ x⟫ = ‖x‖‖ρ_θ x‖ cos θ, i.e., cos(angle(x, ρ_θ x)) = cos θ. This is the conventional way to express “the angle between x and ρ_θ(x) is θ.”
- Minor subtlety: If one defines “angle between vectors” as a value in [0, π], then saying “angle equals θ for all θ ∈ ℝ” is ambiguous without clarifying modulo 2π or orientation. The code phrases it via the cosine identity, which is the standard precise formulation and is commonly accepted as the mathematical content of the statement. So the formalization is faithful in spirit and content.
- Auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders), and rho is indeed defined as the rotation matrix, so the “hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ” part is reflected in the definition rather than re-proven in the theorem.

Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem precisely captures the core mathematical statement via the cosine identity, with the standard inner product and norm on ℝ². The only potential nuance is the usual convention about the range of the angle, but expressing the claim via cos resolves it. Overall, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- `variable {U : Set ℂ} (ψ : ℂ × ℝ → ℂ)`: We fix an open subset U of ℂ and a function ψ defined on ℂ × ℝ (globally). The subsequent hypotheses will only concern ψ on U × [0,1].
- The theorem statement `integral_of_holomorphic_is_holomorphic` assumes:
  - `U_open : IsOpen U`: U is open in ℂ.
  - `ψ_cont : ContinuousOn (fun p : ℂ × ℝ => ψ p) (U ×ˢ (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1))`: ψ is continuous on the subset U × [0,1].
  - `holo_fiber : ∀ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ψ (z, t)) U`: for each fixed t ∈ [0,1], the function z ↦ ψ(z, t) is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ∫ t in Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ψ (z, t) ∂volume) U`: the function h(z) = ∫_{t∈[0,1]} ψ(z,t) dt (Lebesgue integral with respect to `volume` on ℝ) is complex differentiable on U; i.e., h is holomorphic on U.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open; ψ: U × [0,1] → ℂ continuous; for each t, z ↦ ψ(z,t) is holomorphic on U; then h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z,t) dt is holomorphic on U.
- Lean: Exactly mirrors these assumptions using `ContinuousOn` on U × [0,1], and `DifferentiableOn ℂ` for the z-fibers on U, and concludes `DifferentiableOn ℂ` for the parameter integral over [0,1]. Using the Lebesgue integral `∂volume` over `Icc (0 : ℝ) 1` is the standard formalization of ∫_0^1 dt and is equivalent under the given continuity.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Minor formalization differences:
  - ψ is globally defined on ℂ × ℝ but only required to be continuous and holomorphic on U × [0,1]; this is a harmless generalization common in formalization.
  - The integral is a Lebesgue integral over `Icc (0 : ℝ) 1` rather than a Riemann integral; with continuity this matches the intended meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; all assumptions are meaningful and standard in Mathlib. The conclusion precisely matches ""h is holomorphic on U"" as `DifferentiableOn ℂ`.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The theorem declares a function f : ℂ → ℂ and assumes:
  • h_analytic: f is analytic on the open unit ball Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1. Over ℂ, AnalyticOn ℂ f U means holomorphic on the open set U.
  • h_maps: For every z in the unit ball, |f z| < 1. This states that f maps the open unit disk into itself.
  • h0: f 0 = 0.
  The conclusion is Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1, i.e., |f′(0)| ≤ 1. Since f is analytic on the disk, deriv f 0 is the usual complex derivative at 0.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f′(0)| ≤ 1. The code encodes this as f analytic on the unit disk, mapping points of the disk into the disk, and vanishing at 0, concluding |f′(0)| ≤ 1. This matches exactly the Schwarz lemma inequality part.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code takes f as a global function ℂ → ℂ but only assumes analyticity on the unit disk and the mapping property on the disk. The natural statement has domain 𝔻. This is a standard formalization trick and does not change the content: only the behavior on the disk matters, and AnalyticOn on the disk ensures differentiability at 0.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used. The theorem statement is faithful.

  states: For any complex number z, the complex absolute value of the complex cosine of z is greater than or equal to the complex absolute value of the complex cosine evaluated at the real part of z (with the real part coerced to a complex number).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, show |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
- In Lean, `Complex.cos (z.re : Complex)` is the complex cosine applied to the real number Re z embedded in ℂ. On real inputs, complex cosine equals the real cosine, so this matches the intended meaning of cos(Re z).
- `Complex.abs` computes the complex modulus; when applied to a complex number that is actually real, it coincides with the real absolute value. Hence `Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : Complex))` corresponds to |cos(Re z)|.
- Therefore, the Lean statement precisely matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences or red flags:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only subtlety is the coercion `(z.re : Complex)` and use of `Complex.cos`, which is standard and faithful to the intended meaning.
- No discrepancies in inequality direction or objects involved.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem holomorphic_zero_multiplicity_local_count {U : Set ℂ} (hUop : IsOpen U) (hUconn : IsConnected U)`: U is a subset of ℂ which is open and connected (a domain).
- `{f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U)`: f is a function ℂ → ℂ which is analytic on U. (This formalizes f : U → ℂ by extending the domain to ℂ and restricting analyticity to U.)
- `{z0 c : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) (hval : f z0 = c)`: z0 ∈ U and f(z0) = c.
- `(hderiv : deriv f z0 = 0)`: the complex derivative of f at z0 is 0.
- Conclusion: `(∀ z ∈ U, f z = c) ∨ (∃ (m : ℕ) (V : Set ℂ), IsOpen V ∧ z0 ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ True)`.
  This says: either f is identically equal to c on U, or there exist a natural number m and an open neighborhood V of z0 contained in U. The final conjunct `∧ True` adds no content; i.e., the second disjunct imposes no relationship between m, V, and f, nor any counting/multiplicity claim.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U is a domain, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and not constant. If f(z0) = c and f'(z0) = 0, then either f(z) = c for all z ∈ U, or else if z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f⁻¹(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicities).
- Differences:
  - The Lean code does not include the assumption that f is not constant. It allows the constant case as the first disjunct. This is a mild generalization and would be acceptable if the rest were correct.
  - Crucially, the second disjunct in Lean is vacuous: it merely asserts the existence of an m and an open V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, with no relation to f, no order-of-zero assumption, and no statement about the local structure of the preimage f⁻¹({c}) near z0. The placeholder `True` makes the claim trivial and unrelated to multiplicity or counting points.
  - The natural statement conditions the second case on “z0 is a zero of f − c of order m” and concludes “f⁻¹(c) ∩ V has exactly m points counted with multiplicity.” None of this is present in the Lean statement.
  - There is no mention/encoding of “counted with multiplicities,” nor a definition or reference tying m to the multiplicity/order of the zero.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
- No. The core mathematical content—local counting of preimages with multiplicity equal to the order of the zero—is entirely missing in the Lean statement. The presence of `True` in the existential renders the second alternative meaningless. The assumption “not constant” is also omitted (though that would be a minor acceptable generalization if the rest were faithful). Hence the Lean code does not faithfully capture the natural language statement.

Given these issues, the translation is not faithful.

Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus |·|, and `Complex.log` is the principal branch of the complex logarithm. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: If z ∈ ℂ and |z| < 1, then |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean statement matches this exactly: same domain (z ∈ ℂ), same hypothesis (|z| < 1), same conclusion (|log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|)). The modulus and division are correctly represented.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only potential subtlety is that Lean’s `Complex.log` is the principal complex logarithm. The natural language statement typically also refers to the principal branch when writing `log` in a complex analysis context, especially since the bound comes from the power series for log(1 − z) around z = 0 with log(1) = 0. For |z| < 1, 1 − z ≠ 0, so the value is well-defined and coincides with that analytic branch. Hence, there is no meaningful discrepancy.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def holomorphic_on (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop := True`
  This is a placeholder: it declares a predicate named ""holomorphic_on"" but defines it as `True` for all `f` and `U`. It does not capture the actual notion of holomorphy from Mathlib.

- `def analytic_at (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ) : Prop := True`
  Similarly, this is a placeholder: it declares a predicate ""analytic_at"" but defines it as `True` for any `f` and `z0`. It does not encode the intended content (existence of a convergent Taylor series whose sum is `f` in a neighborhood).

- `theorem holomorphic_on_implies_analytic {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ}
  (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) (h : holomorphic_on f U) : analytic_at f z0 := by sorry`
  The statement says: if `z0 ∈ U` and `f` is ""holomorphic_on"" `U` (in the placeholder sense), then `f` is ""analytic_at"" `z0` (in the placeholder sense). Given both predicates are defined as `True`, the theorem is vacuous. The `sorry` means no proof is provided, but Lean accepts it by default; however, the content is not meaningfully formalized.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement says: If `f : U → ℂ` is holomorphic on a domain `U ⊂ ℂ`, then `f` is analytic; for each `z0 ∈ U`, it has a Taylor series converging on the disk of radius equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum equals `f`.
- The Lean code does not use Mathlib's actual notions (e.g., `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0`, `HolomorphicOn`, `AnalyticOn`, etc.). Instead it replaces them with `True`, making the predicates vacuous. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous placeholders.
- Even ignoring that, the theorem statement itself is strictly weaker than the original: it only claims ""analytic_at f z0"" (with a placeholder meaning) and does not formalize the radius of convergence as the distance to the nearest singularity, nor the equality of the sum to `f`. The mention of radius and singularities appears only in a comment/docstring, not in the formal statement.
- Additionally, the code does not assume `U` is a domain (open and connected), and models `f : ℂ → ℂ` together with a set `U`, rather than a function `f : U → ℂ`, which is acceptable in Mathlib style but here is not tied to correct notions due to the placeholders.

Final check:
- The two problems are different. The Lean code uses vacuous definitions and proves a trivial statement, failing to capture essential content: holomorphy, analyticity, Taylor series, radius as distance to nearest singularity, and equality of the sum with `f`.

Given the placeholders and the mismatch in strength (even if replaced with real definitions, the theorem as stated would still not capture the radius equals nearest singularity), this is not a faithful translation.

- The theorem states: `Complex.abs (a + b) ^ 2 = Complex.abs a ^ 2 + Complex.abs b ^ 2 + 2 * (a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im)`.
  In words: |a + b|^2 equals |a|^2 plus |b|^2 plus 2 times (a.re*b.re + a.im*b.im).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For a, b in ℂ, |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b).
- In complex arithmetic, Re(a \bar b) = a.re*b.re + a.im*b.im. Thus the Lean RHS, `2 * (a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im)`, exactly matches `2 Re(a \bar b)`.
- All quantities are real-valued (Complex.abs returns a real; re and im are real), matching the standard interpretation of the identity.

Final check:
- Variables and domains match (a, b : ℂ).
- The identity stated in Lean is mathematically equivalent to the given statement, just expanding Re(a \bar b) in terms of real and imaginary parts.
- No extraneous assumptions or definitions are introduced.

Therefore, the Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The comment explains the intended formalization: holomorphic at z0 is expressed as `DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0`, and ""conformal at z0"" is expressed as the existence of a complex Fréchet derivative `f' : ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` at z0 that is an `IsConformalMap`.
- The theorem `holomorphic_conformal_iff_deriv_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ} (h : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0)` states: assuming f is complex-differentiable at z0, the following are equivalent:
  • There exists a complex-linear continuous linear map f' such that `HasFDerivAt f f' z0` and `IsConformalMap f'`.
  • `deriv f z0 ≠ 0` (the complex derivative at z0 is nonzero).

This uses standard Mathlib notions: `DifferentiableAt` (complex differentiability), `HasFDerivAt` (complex Fréchet derivative), `ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` (continuous ℂ-linear maps on ℂ), `IsConformalMap` (conformal linear map), and `deriv` (complex derivative ℂ → ℂ).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Suppose f is holomorphic. Show f is conformal at z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.
- The code’s hypothesis `DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0` is a local form of ""holomorphic"" at the point z0, which is exactly what's needed for the equivalence, and is a standard formalization.
- The left side of the equivalence in Lean exactly formalizes ""f is conformal at z0"" as ""the (complex) derivative exists at z0 and the derivative map is conformal"". For ℂ → ℂ, the derivative map is multiplication by `deriv f z0`, and `IsConformalMap` for a complex-linear map corresponds to that scalar being nonzero.
- The right side `deriv f z0 ≠ 0` matches the classical condition.
- There are no placeholder or vacuous auxiliary definitions; everything uses Mathlib’s standard notions.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement is a faithful formalization: assuming differentiability (holomorphic at the point), conformality at z0 is equivalent to nonzero derivative at z0. The natural statement’s global “holomorphic” assumption is stronger than needed; the code uses the minimal local hypothesis, which is acceptable.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

- `theorem abs_sin_le (z : ℂ) : ‖sin z‖ ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp ‖z‖ := by sorry`: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of sin z is at most (1/2) times exp of the real norm of z. Here ‖·‖ is the complex norm (modulus), and `Real.exp ‖z‖` is e^{‖z‖} with ‖z‖ ∈ ℝ.
- `theorem abs_cos_le (z : ℂ) : ‖cos z‖ ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp ‖z‖ := by sorry`: Similarly, for any complex number z, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{‖z‖}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural language statement: For all z ∈ ℂ, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The Lean statements exactly express these inequalities using the complex norm ‖z‖ (the modulus |z|) and Real.exp for the real exponential. The factor (1/2) matches, and the domain is all complex numbers z.

- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given with `sorry` proofs omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

- `theorem abs_cos_ge_abs_cos_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number z. It asserts that the complex absolute value of the complex cosine of z is greater than or equal to the complex absolute value of the complex cosine of the real part of z, where the real part `z.re` is coerced to ℂ. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: For any z ∈ ℂ, |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
- The Lean statement matches this: it uses Complex.abs for absolute value and Complex.cos for cosine. For `cos(Re z)`, the code coerces `z.re : ℝ` to ℂ and applies Complex.cos, then Complex.abs. Since cos of a real, coerced to ℂ, is real-valued, Complex.abs equals the usual real absolute value. Therefore, this is a faithful formalization of the statement.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only subtlety is the use of Complex.abs and Complex.cos on `(z.re : ℂ)` instead of Real.cos and Real.abs, but these are equivalent in value for real inputs, so there is no change in meaning.
- Hence, the two statements are the same.

Notes on notation: `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus |·|, `Real.exp` is the real exponential e^·, and `(1/2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is the same as (1/2) e^{|z|}. The binder `(z : Complex)` gives a universal quantification over z ∈ ℂ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks to prove that for all z ∈ ℂ, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. Each theorem precisely states these inequalities for arbitrary z ∈ ℂ. No extra conditions are imposed, and constants and functions match exactly.

- Quantities: sinh, cosh; modulus; exponential; factor 1/2 — all match.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `noncomputable section` are setup and do not affect the mathematical content.
- The theorem `jirilebl_ca_ca_19502 (z : Complex) (h : Complex.abs z < 1)` assumes a complex number `z` with `|z| < 1`.
- The statement `∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) = Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` asserts that the infinite sum over natural numbers `n` (starting at 0) of `(abs z)^(n+1)` equals `abs z / (1 - abs z)`.

Interpretation:
- Since the index runs over `n : ℕ` with exponent `n + 1`, the left-hand side is exactly the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n. The right-hand side is |z|/(1 - |z|). The values lie in ℝ because `Complex.abs z : ℝ` and real powers/sums are used, which matches the intended meaning of the absolute value series.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 - |z|).
- Lean: Exactly the same, with the summation written as ∑' over ℕ of |z|^(n+1), which is an equivalent reindexing.

No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is precise and faithful. The only difference is the indexing shift from n=1 to n+1 with n starting at 0, which is mathematically identical.

- The docstring: ""/-- For z ∈ ℂ we have |csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|, where csc is defined as 1 / sin. -/"" states the intended natural-language claim.
- `lemma complex.abs_csc_ge_abs_csc_re (z : ℂ) : ... := by sorry` declares a lemma for an arbitrary complex number `z`.
- The statement `Complex.abs ((1 : ℂ) / Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs ((1 : ℂ) / Complex.sin (z.re))` means: the complex modulus of `1 / sin z` is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of `1 / sin (z.re)`, where `z.re : ℝ` is implicitly coerced to a complex number. This is exactly `|csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|` with `csc` defined as `1/sin` and absolute value as complex modulus.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for assessing translation faithfulness per the instructions.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|. The code asserts precisely this, using `1 / sin` instead of `csc`, and interpreting `Re z` as a real coerced into ℂ. The absolute value is the complex modulus, which coincides with the real absolute value when applied to real numbers (and the RHS expression is real-valued). Thus, the formal statement matches the intended meaning.

3) Final check — same or different?
- They are the same. The inequality direction and functions match exactly. The use of `Complex.sin (z.re)` corresponds to applying sin to the real part, then viewing it as a complex number. There are no extraneous or vacuous definitions. No scope changes or additional hypotheses have been introduced.
- Note: Whether the statement is true mathematically is not the point here; the code faithfully represents the given (possibly false) claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The lemma is named `exists_point_with_smaller_value_polynomial` and works over ℂ with `open Complex`.
- Inputs:
  - `ε : ℝ` and `hε : 0 < ε` assume a positive real radius ε.
  - `p : Polynomial ℂ` is a complex polynomial.
  - `hp_nonconst : ¬ ∃ (c : ℂ), p = Polynomial.C c` asserts p is nonconstant (not equal to a constant polynomial C c).
  - `z0 : ℂ` is a point in ℂ.
  - `hz : Polynomial.eval z0 p ≠ 0` asserts p(z0) ≠ 0.
- Conclusion:
  - `∃ w : ℂ, Complex.abs (w - z0) < ε ∧ Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval w p) < Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval z0 p)`
  - There exists w in ℂ with |w − z0| < ε such that |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

Assessment of alignment with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: for ε > 0, p a nonconstant complex polynomial (or more generally, a nonconstant power series converging on the open disk of radius ε centered at z0), and p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w in that disk with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- The Lean code precisely formalizes the polynomial case: ε > 0, p a nonconstant polynomial, p(z0) ≠ 0, and concludes existence of w with |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- The more general power series case is not included in the Lean statement; however, the code faithfully captures the polynomial case, which is explicitly one of the cases in the natural language statement. Since polynomials are entire, no additional convergence assumption is needed.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions: `Polynomial.eval`, `Polynomial.C`, and `Complex.abs`. The nonconst condition via `¬ ∃ c, p = Polynomial.C c` is a valid formalization of nonconstancy.

Final check:
- Are the two math problems the same? The Lean code is a faithful specialization to the polynomial case of the natural language statement. All hypotheses and the conclusion match for polynomials. The omission of the more general power series case is an acceptable specialization per the guidelines.
- No discrepancies within the polynomial case.

  - Fix an open set `U ⊆ ℂ` (`hU : IsOpen U`).
  - Consider a function `f : ℂ → ℂ` defined on all of ℂ.
  - Assume `f` is complex differentiable on `U` (`hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`), i.e., holomorphic on `U` in the usual sense.
  - Assume `f` is injective on all of ℂ (`hi : Function.Injective f`).
  - Conclusion: For every `z ∈ U`, the complex derivative `deriv f z` is nonzero.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If `U ⊆ ℂ` is open and `f : U → ℂ` is holomorphic and injective (on its domain `U`), then `f'(z) ≠ 0` for every `z ∈ U`.
- The Lean code captures holomorphic on `U` correctly via `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` and the conclusion `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0` matches `f'(z) ≠ 0` on `U`.
- Main discrepancy: Injectivity. The natural statement requires injectivity on `U` (either as `f : U → ℂ` injective, or as `InjOn f U` if `f : ℂ → ℂ`). The Lean code assumes global injectivity `Function.Injective f` on all of ℂ, which is strictly stronger than needed.
- Domain modeling: Using `f : ℂ → ℂ` with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` is a standard way in Mathlib to represent a holomorphic function on an open set `U`. That part is fine.

Final check:
- The code is a specialization of the original statement (it imposes a stronger hypothesis: global injectivity rather than injectivity on `U`). It does not introduce vacuous definitions, and the statement is otherwise aligned.
- Because of the stronger injectivity assumption, the translation is not fully faithful to the original statement, though it is very close and in the right formalism. A more faithful Lean formulation would use `hi : Set.InjOn f U` or take `f : U → ℂ` with `Injective f`.

- The Lean statement uses Complex.abs for absolute value and Complex.sin for sine. On the right-hand side, it coerces z.re (a real) to ℂ and applies Complex.sin, then Complex.abs. For real inputs, Complex.sin coincides with Real.sin (as a real-valued complex number), and Complex.abs of a real number equals its Real absolute value.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, including complex numbers and absolute value.
- The theorem is named `complex_abs_eq_iff_re_z_mul_conj_w_zero` and has parameters `{z w : ℂ}` with a hypothesis `(h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w)`. This matches the assumption |z| = |w| in the statement.
- The statement: `Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w) ↔ (z * (star w)).re = 0` asserts an equivalence between the equality of the absolute values |z + w| and |z − w|, and the real part of `z * (conj w)` being zero. In Lean, `star w` is the complex conjugate of `w`, and `.re` denotes the real part. Thus `(z * (star w)).re = 0` means `z conj(w)` is purely imaginary.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; no placeholders besides the proof `by sorry`. The statement is exact and uses standard Mathlib notions.

Faithfulness check to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If z, w ∈ ℂ and |z| = |w|, then |z + w| = |z − w| iff z \bar{w} is purely imaginary.
- Lean theorem: Under the hypothesis |z| = |w|, |z + w| = |z − w| ↔ Re(z conj(w)) = 0, i.e., z \bar{w} is purely imaginary.
- This is a faithful translation: the assumption matches, the equivalence matches, and ""purely imaginary"" is correctly encoded as real part zero. Allowing zero is standard for ""purely imaginary,"" so there is no mismatch.

Final check: The two statements are the same. No extra conditions or missing parts. No vacuous or misleading auxiliary definitions. The use of `star` and `.re` is appropriate and standard.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- Comment: States the mathematical goal.
- `theorem sec_abs_ge_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (1 / Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (1 / Complex.cos z.re) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of 1 divided by the complex cosine of z is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of 1 divided by the complex cosine of the real part of z. Here `z.re : ℝ` is coerced to a complex number when passed to `Complex.cos`, so the right-hand side is |sec(Re z)| interpreted in ℂ, which coincides with the real absolute value since the value is real.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sec z| ≥ |sec (Re z)|.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes |1/cos z| ≥ |1/cos (z.re)|, i.e., |sec z| ≥ |sec(Re z)|, with the absolute value being the complex modulus. Since sec(Re z) is real, this matches the intended absolute value.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the brief (only the statement is needed).

3) Final check: The two statements are the same. There are no discrepancies in quantification, functions used (sec as 1/cos), or domains. The minor technicality of coercing `z.re` to Complex is standard and faithful to the intended meaning.

Note: While the mathematical truth of the inequality might be questionable (typically |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)| would imply |sec z| ≤ |sec(Re z)|), the task is to check faithful translation, not correctness. The code faithfully captures the given (possibly incorrect) inequality.

theorem exp_ne_zero (z : Complex) : Complex.exp z ≠ 0 := by sorry
",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The first theorem `mul_add_function_ne_zero` states: For a function f : ℂ → ℂ, if for all z, w we have f(z + w) = f(z) * f(w) (encoded as `h_mul`) and f(0) = 1 (encoded as `h0`), then for all z, f(z) ≠ 0. This directly formalizes the general statement: if a function satisfies the exponential Cauchy functional equation and f(0) = 1, then it never vanishes.
- The second theorem `exp_ne_zero` states: For any complex number z, Complex.exp z ≠ 0. This is the “in particular” instance applying the general theorem to the complex exponential.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to use the properties e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 ≠ 0 to conclude e^z ≠ 0 for all z, and phrases it equivalently in general form: if f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1 then f(z)≠0 for all z. The Lean theorem `mul_add_function_ne_zero` exactly captures this general form over ℂ with the correct hypotheses and conclusion. The omission of explicitly stating 1 ≠ 0 as a hypothesis is fine because in ℂ, 1 ≠ 0 is a known fact in Mathlib, so it need not be an assumption.
- The second theorem `exp_ne_zero` corresponds precisely to the “in particular” statement about the complex exponential being never zero.

Auxiliary definitions:
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The theorems are stated directly with standard Mathlib notions (Complex, Complex.exp). The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task since we judge translation of statements, not proofs, and no placeholders redefine concepts.

Final check:
- The Lean statements are the same as the natural language statements (both the general form and the specific exponential case). No scope mismatch, specialization/generalization issues, or missing conditions that change the meaning. The use of Complex throughout matches ℂ, and the quantifiers and conclusions align exactly.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Setup/imports; fine.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem exp_series_remainder_bound (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) :
    Complex.abs (
      Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => (z ^ k) / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ) - Complex.exp z
    ) ≤ (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (Nat.factorial (n + 1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := ...`
  In words: For complex z and natural n, the absolute value of the finite sum over k = 0..n of [(z^k)/k! − e^z] is less than or equal to |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
  Note crucially: The subtraction `− Complex.exp z` is inside the summand, i.e., the entire expression inside the absolute value is ∑_{k=0}^n [(z^k)/k! − e^z] = (∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) − (n+1) e^z.
  The right-hand side is a real quantity `(Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (Nat.factorial (n+1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`, which matches the intended bound form numerically (up to casting to ℝ), so that part is fine.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Desired: |(∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
- Code: |∑_{k=0}^n [(z^k)/k! − e^z]| ≤ ... = |(∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) − (n+1) e^z| ≤ ...
- The placement of the subtraction with e^z is wrong: in the correct statement, e^z is subtracted once after forming the partial sum; in the code, e^z is subtracted inside each summand, effectively subtracting (n+1) e^z.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The code proves a bound on |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − (n+1) e^z|, whereas the target statement is a bound on |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z|. This is a substantial difference, not a minor technicality. Other aspects (indexing 0..n via `Finset.range (n+1)`, use of ℝ casts for factorial on RHS, and Real.exp (|z|)) are fine.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful due to the incorrect placement of the subtraction.

- `def G : Set M2ˣ := { u | (u : M2) (1 : Fin 2) 0 = 0 }`: G is the subset of the group of units (invertible matrices) M2ˣ consisting of those invertible matrices whose (row 1, col 0) entry is 0. In 2×2 indexing with Fin 2 = {0,1}, this is exactly the lower-left entry. So G = {invertible 2×2 real matrices of the form [[a,b],[0,c]]}.
- `def N : Set M2ˣ := { u | (u : M2) 0 0 = 1 ∧ (u : M2) 1 1 = 1 ∧ (u : M2) (1 : Fin 2) 0 = 0 }`: N is the subset of invertible matrices with top-left entry 1, bottom-right entry 1, and lower-left entry 0; i.e., all invertible matrices of the form [[1,b],[0,1]]. This leaves the upper-right entry arbitrary, as desired, and such matrices are indeed invertible.
- `theorem G_is_subgroup : (1 : M2ˣ) ∈ G ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ G → y ∈ G → x * y ∈ G) ∧ (∀ x, x ∈ G → x⁻¹ ∈ G)`: This asserts identity is in G, G is closed under multiplication, and closed under inversion; i.e., G is a subgroup of GL(2, ℝ).

- `theorem N_normal : ∀ g ∈ G, ∀ n ∈ N, g * n * g⁻¹ ∈ N`: This states that for every g in G and n in N, the conjugate g n g⁻¹ is in N; i.e., N is normal with respect to conjugation by elements of G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to define G as the set of real 2×2 matrices of the form [[a,b],[0,c]] and prove it is a subgroup of GL(2). The code defines G as the subset of invertible matrices with lower-left entry 0, exactly corresponding to that form and restricted to GL(2) (M2ˣ). The subgroup property is stated.
- It then defines N as the set of matrices of the form [[1,b],[0,1]] and asks to prove N is a subgroup and normal in G. The code defines N accordingly within GL(2), states the subgroup properties, and states the normality property under conjugation by elements of G.
- Although the code does not separately state N ⊆ G, this inclusion is immediate from the defining conditions (lower-left entry 0) and is standard when one phrases normality as closure under conjugation by G. The provided statements collectively capture exactly the intended results.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all predicates are concrete entry-wise conditions on matrices in GL(2), and the theorems are stated as properties to be proven (with `sorry` as placeholders for proofs, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

3) Final check: The mathematical content matches precisely. The ambient group is GL(2, ℝ) represented as M2ˣ. G and N are defined exactly as the sets described. The subgroup and normality conditions are stated correctly. There are no mismatches or unwanted generalizations/specializations beyond the standard formalization choice of working inside GL(2).

  • `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / ((n + 1) : ℝ)` which reads: |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k.
  • `(∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / ((n + 1) : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z))` which reads: the same series is ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the result is stated directly. The series is over ℕ with a shift (n+1) to match the n=1 to ∞ indexing.

- Right inequality: the same sum ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The conjunction (∧) corresponds to the chained inequality in natural language. The types are consistent: the series is over real numbers since it uses `Complex.abs z` (a real), and the absolute value of the complex log is also real.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses `∑' (n : ℕ), |z|^(n+1)/(n+1)`, which is equivalent to ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n. This is faithful.
- No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions. `Complex.log` is total in Mathlib, and the hypothesis |z| < 1 guarantees 1 − z ≠ 0 anyway.
- The structure as a pair of inequalities matches the “≤ … ≤ …” chain.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Complex` opens the Complex namespace for complex functions like `sinh` and `cosh`.
- The first theorem `abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : ‖sinh z‖ ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp ‖z‖` states: For any complex number z, the modulus (norm) of sinh z is less than or equal to one half times e raised to the absolute value (norm) of z. This directly matches |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- The second theorem `abs_cosh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : ‖cosh z‖ ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp ‖z‖` states the analogous inequality for cosh: For any complex number z, the modulus of cosh z is ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. This directly matches |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Notes on notation: `‖z‖` is the complex norm |z|, and `Real.exp ‖z‖` is e^{|z|}. There are no auxiliary definitions; both theorems are simple statements with the exact inequalities.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement: The Lean theorems assert exactly the two inequalities for all z ∈ ℂ, with the same constants and expressions. The separation into two theorems corresponds to the two claims in the natural language statement.

3) Final check: The mathematical problems stated in Lean and in natural language are the same. There are no changes in hypotheses, domains, or constants. The use of `Real.exp` with the real norm is appropriate and faithful to e^{|z|}. While the statements might be mathematically false in general (e.g., |cosh 0| = 1 is not ≤ 1/2), that does not affect the faithfulness of the translation.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib, providing complex numbers, exponential, norms, etc.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_14450 (z : ℂ) : ‖Complex.exp z‖ = Real.exp z.re := by sorry`: States a theorem: for any complex number `z`, the norm (absolute value) of the complex exponential `exp z` equals the real exponential of the real part of `z`. Here `‖·‖` is the standard norm on ℂ (i.e., absolute value), `Complex.exp z` is e^z in the complex sense, and `Real.exp z.re` is e^{Re z}.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ, |e^z| = e^{Re z}.

3) Final check:
- Same domain: z ∈ ℂ.
- Same functions: Complex exponential and absolute value/norm on ℂ.
- Same equality: |e^z| equals e^{Re z}.
- No extra hypotheses or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions introduced.
Thus, the code is a faithful formalization of the statement.

- `theorem normSq_add_eq (a b : ℂ) : Complex.normSq (a + b) = Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b + 2 * (a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im) := by sorry`:
  This asserts that for complex a, b, the squared norm of a+b equals the sum of the squared norms plus twice the dot product of their (re,im) parts. In Mathlib, `Complex.normSq z` is the real number |z|^2, and `a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im` equals `Re (a * conj b)`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- LHS: `Complex.normSq (a + b)` matches |a+b|^2.
- RHS: `Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b + 2 * (a.re * b.re + a.im * b.im)` matches |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a conj b) using the standard identity Re(a conj b) = a.re*b.re + a.im*b.im.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem is a direct formalization of the statement (expressed via equivalent components already noted in the comment).

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is mathematically equivalent to the natural language statement, differing only by expressing Re(a conj b) via real and imaginary parts and using `Complex.normSq` for |·|^2. No discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Finset`: bring in Mathlib and finite set utilities.
- The docstring states the intended theorem: for any complex z and natural n, the truncation error of the exponential series after n satisfies the standard remainder estimate: |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
- `theorem exp_series_remainder_bound (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) : ... := by sorry` declares a theorem with variables z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ.
- LHS: `Complex.abs (Finset.sum (range (n + 1)) (fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z)` is the complex modulus of the difference between (i) the finite sum ∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! (modeled as `sum (range (n+1))`) and (ii) the complex exponential e^z (`Complex.exp z`). The factorials in the sum are cast to ℂ to match the type.
- RHS: `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n + 1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is |z|^{n+1} divided by (n+1)! (cast to ℝ), times e^{|z|} (`Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`).
- The inequality `≤` is between real numbers, since `Complex.abs` returns a real number and the RHS is expressed in reals.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show: for all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.
- The code exactly formalizes this: the finite sum is modeled with `Finset.range (n+1)` (which enumerates k = 0, …, n), the exponential is `Complex.exp z`, the modulus is `Complex.abs`, and the right side is |z|^{n+1} divided by (n+1)! times e^{|z|}.
- Type casts (to ℂ in the sum, to ℝ on the right) are standard and do not change the mathematical content.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: `range (n+1)` matches k = 0 to n inclusively. Correct.
- Factorials: inside the sum `Nat.factorial k` cast to ℂ matches k! in the denominator; RHS uses `(n+1)!` cast to ℝ. Correct.
- Absolute value and exponentials: `Complex.abs` and `Complex.exp` on the left, `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` on the right match |·| and e^{·} appropriately. Correct.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with omitted proof, which is acceptable per the task.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) :` introduces a statement for arbitrary complex numbers z and w.
- `4 * z * (starRingEnd ℂ w) =` means 4 times z times the star/conjugate of w; for ℂ, `starRingEnd ℂ w` is the complex conjugate of w, i.e., conj w.
- `(Complex.normSq (z + w) : ℂ) - (Complex.normSq (z - w) : ℂ)` uses `Complex.normSq : ℂ → ℝ`, which equals |·|^2, and casts it to ℂ; this is |z+w|^2 − |z−w|^2 viewed in ℂ.
- `+ Complex.I * ((Complex.normSq (z + Complex.I * w) : ℂ) - (Complex.normSq (z - Complex.I * w) : ℂ))` adds i times the difference of |z+iw|^2 and |z−iw|^2, again casting each norm square from ℝ to ℂ.
- The whole theorem asserts exactly the polarization identity in ℂ: 4 z conj(w) equals that combination of squared norms.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: 4 z\bar{w} = |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i ( |z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2 ). The Lean statement matches this precisely: conj(w) via `starRingEnd ℂ w`, |·|^2 via `Complex.normSq`, appropriate placements of z±w and z±i w, and the factor of i as `Complex.I` multiplying the difference. The necessary casts from ℝ to ℂ are standard formal details and do not change the meaning.

3) Final check of differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with `sorry` proof placeholder.
- The only formal nuance is casting norm squares (real) to ℂ, which is expected. Signs and factors (4, i) and arguments (z±w, z±i w) all match.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language identity.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `schwarz_lemma` is stated for a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
- `h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℂ f {z : ℂ | Complex.abs z < (1 : ℝ)}` asserts that f is holomorphic on the open unit disk D = {z : ℂ | |z| < 1}.
- `h_map : ∀ (z : ℂ), Complex.abs z < (1 : ℝ) → Complex.abs (f z) < (1 : ℝ)` asserts that f maps the unit disk into itself: if |z| < 1 then |f z| < 1.
- `h0 : f 0 = 0` asserts f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion: `∀ (z : ℂ), Complex.abs (f z) ≤ Complex.abs z` claims that for all complex numbers z (no restriction), |f(z)| ≤ |z|.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement claims: if f : D → D is holomorphic and f(0)=0, then |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ D.
- The hypotheses in the Lean code match this: holomorphic on D, f maps D to D, and f(0)=0. However, the conclusion in the Lean code is strictly stronger: it claims the inequality for all z ∈ ℂ, without requiring that z ∈ D. This is not generally true and exceeds the intended scope.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are not the same. The Lean code overgeneralizes the conclusion from “for all z in D” to “for all z in ℂ.” Everything else aligns, but this key mismatch makes the translation unfaithful.

Grade rationale: The code is very close in hypotheses and intent, but the unrestricted universal quantifier in the conclusion is a significant error. Hence, not faithful, but close (8/10).

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- Imports Mathlib and opens Equiv. We work with permutations as Equiv.Perm.
- The theorem srdoty_alg_abstract_gps_1108 takes:
  - n : ℕ with hn : 2 ≤ n and hnz : NeZero n (extra, not essential).
  - i : ℕ with hi : 1 < i ∧ i < n.
- Let α : Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n 0) (Fin.ofNat n 1). This is the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in Fin n, i.e., the 1-based (1 2).
- Let β : Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.ofBijective (fun k : Fin n => Fin.ofNat n (k.val + 1)) (… sorry …). This is the permutation sending k to k+1 mod n (the n-cycle (0 1 … n-1)), but the bijectivity proof is left as sorry.
- The asserted equality is:
  Equiv.swap (Fin.ofNat n (i - 1)) (Fin.ofNat n i) = (β ^ (i - 1)) * α * (β ^ (n - i + 1))
  with the proof also left as sorry.
- Note: Fin indices are 0-based, so swapping (i-1, i) in Fin corresponds to the 1-based transposition (i, i+1). The exponents are natural powers; the rightmost exponent n - i + 1 is the positive substitute for −(i−1) using β^n = 1.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- NL statement: For n ≥ 2, α = (1 2), β = (1 2 … n) ∈ Sym_n. For any 1 < i < n, (i i+1) = β^{i−1} α β^{−(i−1)} = β^{i−1} α β^{n−i+1}.
- The Lean α matches (1 2) using 0-based Fin: swap 0 and 1.
- The Lean β matches the n-cycle (shift by +1 mod n), though its bijectivity evidence is a sorry.
- The Lean conclusion asserts only the equality (i i+1) = β^(i−1) α β^(n−i+1), i.e., the second equality from the NL statement. It does not explicitly state the first equality with β^{−(i−1)}; presumably it relies on β^n = 1 to identify β^{−(i−1)} with β^{n−i+1}, but that identification is not stated in the theorem.

Step 3: Are they the same?
- Substantive content: The Lean statement captures the equality using the positive exponent n−i+1, which is one of the two equal expressions in the NL chain. This is essentially the same mathematical content for the target equality, given the standard fact β^{−(i−1)} = β^{n−i+1} for the n-cycle. However, the Lean theorem omits the explicit equality to β^{−(i−1)} that the NL statement also asserts.
- Technical issues per guidelines:
  - The definition of β uses Equiv.ofBijective with a bijectivity proof filled by sorry. This is a vacuous placeholder in an auxiliary definition, which the guidelines flag as failing translation.
  - The theorem itself is stated with by sorry, which is acceptable for omitting the proof, but combined with the vacuous proof inside β’s definition, it counts against faithfulness.
- Minor differences acceptable:
  - 0-based vs 1-based indexing: handled correctly via Fin.ofNat and the (i−1, i) swap, consistent with 1-based (i, i+1).
  - Extra assumption NeZero n is harmless.

Conclusion: While the intended mathematical statement aligns fairly well (up to expressing the inverse power as a positive power), the presence of sorry in the auxiliary bijectivity proof for β violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders in definitions, and the theorem does not explicitly include the β^{−(i−1)} equality. Therefore, it is not a fully faithful translation under the auditing rules.

  States that for any complex number z, the complex norm of cosh z is at most (1/2) e^{|z|}, i.e., |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to prove two inequalities for all complex z: |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- The Lean theorems exactly assert these inequalities, with standard Mathlib notations: `‖·‖` for complex absolute value, `Complex.sinh`, `Complex.cosh`, and `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` for e^{|z|}. There are no extra hypotheses or changes in scope.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorems are directly stated. The use of `sorry` is acceptable for this audit as we are checking translation, not proofs.

3) Final check for differences:
- The inequalities and quantification over all complex z match exactly. No generalization or specialization is introduced. The factor (1/2) and the use of the complex modulus are identical to the natural language statement.
- Note: Mathematically, the cosh inequality with factor 1/2 is false (e.g., at z = 0), but this does not affect the faithfulness of the translation; the Lean statements faithfully mirror the given natural language claims.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` just imports the math library.
- `lemma abs_sin_le_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, the complex modulus of sin z is less than or equal to (1/2) times the real exponential of the complex modulus of z; i.e., |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `lemma abs_cos_le_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
There are no auxiliary definitions; `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus, `Complex.sin` and `Complex.cos` are the complex sine and cosine, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential function applied to the real number |z|.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to prove, for z in C, that |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean lemmas state exactly these two inequalities for all complex z. The notation matches: absolute value is the complex modulus, the exponential is the real exponential applied to |z|, and the constants align.

3) Final check of equivalence:
The two mathematical statements coincide precisely. There are no extra hypotheses, no weakenings/strengthenings, and no vacuous or placeholder definitions. The use of `sorry` is only for the proof, which is not part of the translation audit.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library, giving access to complex numbers, absolute values, logarithms, and inequalities.
- Comment explains the intended statement.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, if |z| < 1 then |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|). Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus (a real number), and `Complex.log` denotes the principal complex logarithm. The inequality is an inequality in the real numbers. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for checking translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Hypothesis `h : Complex.abs z < 1` matches “|z| < 1”.
- Conclusion `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` matches “|log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|)”.
- The types align: `Complex.abs : ℂ → ℝ`, so both sides are real numbers and the inequality is the intended real inequality.
- `Complex.log` is the principal complex logarithm in Mathlib, which is the standard interpretation in such inequalities. No extra or missing conditions are introduced.
- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced; the statement is direct.

3) Final check: The Lean theorem statement is exactly the same mathematical statement as the natural language one. No discrepancies in domain, hypotheses, or conclusion.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- Theorem `abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`: For any complex number z, the modulus of sinh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z. Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus |·| and `Real.exp` is the real exponential function, so the right-hand side is (1/2) e^{|z|}. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is clear.
- Theorem `abs_cosh_le_half_exp_abs (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`: Similarly, for any complex number z, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. Again, `by sorry` omits the proof but the statement matches the intended inequality.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to prove, for all z in ℂ, the two inequalities |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean statements are exactly these inequalities, with standard Mathlib notation for modulus and exponential. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with the correct quantification (by taking z as an arbitrary argument).

3) Final check:
- The two math problems are the same. The Lean code precisely states both desired inequalities for all z ∈ ℂ. There are no discrepancies in constants, functions, or domains. The use of Real.exp and Complex.abs corresponds to e^{|z|} and |·| respectively. No extra conditions are added or omitted.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem jirilebl_log_one_sub_bound (z : ℂ) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry` introduces the theorem: for a complex number z with |z| < 1, we aim to prove two inequalities.
- The statement is: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n+1) / (n+1) ∧ (∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n+1) / (n+1)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`.
  • First conjunct: |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑'_{n:ℕ} |z|^(n+1)/(n+1).
  • Second conjunct: ∑'_{n:ℕ} |z|^(n+1)/(n+1) ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
  Here `∑'` is the infinite sum (tsum). Since the summand is real (uses `Complex.abs z : ℝ`), the sum is over ℝ. The indexing with `(n+1)` is a standard shift so that this sum equals ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k/k.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1−z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1−|z|).
- The Lean theorem assumes z: ℂ and the hypothesis |z| < 1, and concludes exactly the two inequalities. The middle series is written as a tsum over ℕ with index shift `n+1`, which is equivalent to starting at 1. The result is stated as a conjunction of the two inequalities, equivalent to the chain of inequalities in the natural statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All symbols are standard Mathlib notions: Complex.abs, Complex.log, tsum. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task; it does not introduce fake definitions.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing of the series: Lean uses ∑' n:ℕ of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1); the original uses ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n. These are mathematically identical via an index shift.
- Inequalities are presented as a conjunction rather than a chain; logically equivalent.
- Types: The sum and bounds are in ℝ, matching the absolute values. The log is the complex log (principal branch), consistent with the complex setting |·| denotes modulus.
- No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions. The hypothesis |z|<1 is present.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  • ξ, ζ are complex numbers.
  • M is an ℝ-linear map from ℂ to ℂ (equivalently, a 2×2 real matrix acting on ℝ^2 via the identification ℂ ≅ ℝ^2).
  • Hypothesis `hM`: for all z ∈ ℂ, M z = ξ·z + ζ·(z.re − z.im·I). Since z.re − z.im·I = conj z, this is exactly M(z) = ξ z + ζ conj(z).
  • Conclusion: the determinant of M as an ℝ-linear map equals |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2. Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus, and `^ 2` is squaring in ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: A 2×2 real matrix M represented by z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z}. Show det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- The Lean code treats M as an ℝ-linear endomorphism of ℂ, with the same representing formula (using conj z written as z.re − z.im·I).
- Determinant in Lean (`LinearMap.det` over ℝ) is precisely the determinant of the associated 2×2 real matrix. The conclusion matches exactly: det(M) = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.

3) Comparison and possible discrepancies:
- No fake or vacuous definitions; no auxiliary placeholders.
- The representation of conj z as z.re − z.im·I is mathematically correct.
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement in content and generality.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem schwarz_lemma_unit_disk {f : ℂ → ℂ}`: We consider a complex-valued function f defined on all of ℂ (as a convenience for formalization).
- `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball (0:ℂ) 1))`: f is complex-differentiable at every point of the open unit disk D = {z : ‖z‖ < 1}.
- `(hmap : ∀ z, ‖z‖ < 1 → ‖f z‖ < 1)`: For every z in the open unit disk, f z also lies in the open unit disk; i.e., f maps D into itself.
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)`: f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion: `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1`: the modulus of the complex derivative of f at 0 is at most 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement: “Suppose f : D → D is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f′(0)| ≤ 1.” The Lean hypotheses capture:
- Holomorphic on D: `DifferentiableOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1)` is precisely complex differentiability on the open unit disk.
- f maps D into D: `∀ z, ‖z‖ < 1 → ‖f z‖ < 1`.
- f(0) = 0: `h0`.
- Conclusion: `|f′(0)| ≤ 1` is `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1`.
Although f is typed as a function on all of ℂ in Lean, the assumptions and conclusion only concern its behavior on D, which is a standard formalization for functions defined on open subsets. This matches the mathematical content.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: Natural language has f : D → D; Lean takes f : ℂ → ℂ but only assumes differentiability on D and mapping D into D. This is a standard, harmless formalization detail and does not change the meaning.
- All terms are standard Mathlib definitions. There are no vacuous placeholders or auxiliary fake definitions.
- The statement is exactly the derivative bound part of Schwarz lemma.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `theorem holomorphic_conformal_iff_deriv_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z₀ : ℂ} : ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀ ∧ deriv f z₀ ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  This states: For any function f : ℂ → ℂ and any point z₀ ∈ ℂ, f is conformal at z₀ if and only if f is complex differentiable at z₀ and its complex derivative at z₀ is nonzero.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show f is conformal at a point z₀ iff f′(z₀) ≠ 0.”
- Key difference: The natural statement imposes a hypothesis that f is holomorphic (complex differentiable in a neighborhood) before asserting the equivalence at the point. The Lean statement has no such hypothesis and instead asserts the equivalence for arbitrary f, requiring only pointwise differentiability on the right-hand side.

3) Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is a stronger unconditional equivalence. This is problematic: there are conformal maps that are not complex-differentiable but anti-holomorphic (e.g., f(z) = conj z), which are conformal at every point but do not satisfy `DifferentiableAt ℂ f z₀`. Thus the Lean equivalence would be false in general. The holomorphic hypothesis in the natural statement rules out the anti-holomorphic case and makes the equivalence true. Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the natural statement; it omits a crucial assumption and states an equivalence that fails without it.

Additional notes:
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The terms `ConformalAt`, `DifferentiableAt`, and `deriv` are standard Mathlib notions.
- A faithful formalization would include a hypothesis such as `HolomorphicAt f z₀` or a neighborhood version (e.g., `AnalyticAt ℂ f z₀`) and then state `ConformalAt f z₀ ↔ deriv f z₀ ≠ 0` (the differentiability is implied by holomorphicity).

Conclusion: The provided Lean statement is not faithful to the natural statement; it omits the holomorphic assumption and thus asserts an incorrect general equivalence.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|. The Lean version universally quantifies over z : Complex and asserts exactly the inequality with Complex.abs on both sides and Complex.sin on both sides, with the right-hand input coerced from the real part to a complex number. This matches the mathematical meaning: |sin(Re z)| as a real absolute value equals the complex modulus of Complex.sin applied to (Re z : Complex), since on real inputs Complex.sin agrees with the real sine and the complex modulus agrees with the real absolute value.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope: Both are universal in z ∈ ℂ.
- Functions and norms: The Lean statement uses Complex.sin and Complex.abs throughout, with the real part coerced to ℂ. This is equivalent to the natural-language expression |sin(Re z)|, interpreting the absolute value appropriately. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No generalization/specialization discrepancy.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement has two inequalities: |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} for all complex z. The Lean code provides two theorems, one for sine and one for cosine, exactly matching these inequalities. Using `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is exactly e^{|z|}. The factor `(1 / 2 : ℝ) *` corresponds to 1/2·e^{|z|}. The domain and quantification over all z : ℂ are explicit in the theorems' statements.
- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are only theorem statements. Thus no risk of vacuous or misleading definitions.
Final check:

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `lemma holomorphic_locally_injective (U : Set Complex) (f : Complex → Complex) (hU : IsOpen U) (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (h' : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0) : ... := by sorry`
  This states: Let U be a subset of the complex numbers and f: ℂ → ℂ. Assume U is open (`hU`), f is complex differentiable on U (`hd`), and for every z in U, the complex derivative `deriv f z` is nonzero (`h'`). Then the conclusion is:
  `∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V : Set Complex, IsOpen V ∧ z ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y)`
  which means: For every z in U, there exists a set V in ℂ such that V is open, z ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f is injective on V (expressed by the last quantifier condition).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U. Conclude f is locally injective on U.
- The code models f as a function on all of ℂ, with complex differentiability assumed only on U. This is a standard harmless generalization: holomorphic on U is formalized as `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`.
- The nonvanishing derivative hypothesis is captured by `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`; given differentiability on U, this corresponds to the usual complex derivative f'(z) ≠ 0.
- The conclusion states: for each z ∈ U, there is an open V in ℂ with z ∈ V ⊆ U such that f is injective on V, which is exactly “f is locally injective on U.” Requiring V to be open in ℂ and contained in U matches the usual “open neighborhood in U” since U is open.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Domain of f: natural language uses f: U → ℂ; Lean uses f: ℂ → ℂ with differentiability on U. This is a benign generalization that still faithfully captures the original assumptions.
- Holomorphic vs differentiable: `DifferentiableOn ℂ` is the Mathlib notion of holomorphic on U. Correct.
- Derivative condition: `deriv f z ≠ 0` on U matches f'(z) ≠ 0 for z ∈ U, under differentiability.
- Conclusion: Existence of an open V with z ∈ V ⊆ U and injectivity of f on V is exactly local injectivity on U.
No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the statement is nontrivial and matches the mathematical content.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

- `import Mathlib`: use mathlib library.

- `lemma abs_csc_ge_abs_csc_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`
  In words: For any complex number z, the modulus (absolute value) of 1/sin z is greater than or equal to the modulus of 1/sin of the real part of z (viewed as a complex number). This is exactly |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)| if we take csc = 1/sin.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
The original statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|. The Lean statement asserts exactly that inequality, using Complex.abs for |·|, and 1/Complex.sin for csc, and coercion `(z.re : ℂ)` for Re z. This matches the intended content.

3) Final check and possible discrepancies:
- The only potential nuance is that, in informal math, csc is often considered undefined at zeros of sin, whereas Lean’s use of 1/sin is a total function (with 1/0 defined as 0 in the field structure). However, the natural language statement did not specify domain restrictions, and expressing csc as 1/sin is standard. There are no vacuous placeholders or auxiliary definitions. The theorem statement faithfully matches the mathematical meaning intended.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: For all z in C, |sin z| ≤ cosh(Im z). The Lean statement precisely matches this:
- Domain: `z : ℂ` corresponds to z in C.
- Left-hand side: `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z)` is |sin z|.
- Right-hand side: `Real.cosh z.im` is cosh(Im z), since `z.im` is the imaginary part as a real and `Real.cosh` is the real hyperbolic cosine.
No extra conditions or generalizations are introduced.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem declares: for z : Complex with hypothesis h : |z| < 1, the sum ∑' n : ℕ, (|z|)^n equals |z| / (1 - |z|).
- Here, ∑' n : ℕ denotes the infinite sum over all natural numbers n starting at 0, and Complex.abs z ^ n is the nth power of the real number |z|.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement asks to show that for |z| < 1, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n equals |z| / (1 - |z|).
- In Lean, ∑' n : ℕ, ... sums from n = 0. So the code asserts ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^n = |z| / (1 - |z|), which is not correct; the standard identity is ∑_{n=0}^∞ r^n = 1 / (1 - r) for |r| < 1, while ∑_{n=1}^∞ r^n = r / (1 - r).
- Therefore, the Lean code sums from 0, but the natural language sum is from 1. The right-hand side in the code matches the n=1-start version, not the n=0-start version used by ∑' n : ℕ.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is off by the n=0 term. The intended theorem should be one of the following:
  - ∑' n : ℕ, |z|^(n+1) = |z| / (1 - |z|), or
  - ∑' n : ℕ, (if n = 0 then 0 else |z|^n) = |z| / (1 - |z|), or
  - Use a sum indexed over Nat.succ: ∑' n : ℕ, |z|^(Nat.succ n) = |z| / (1 - |z|).
- As written, the code claims the 0-start geometric series equals |z|/(1 - |z|), which is incorrect and does not faithfully translate the statement that starts from n=1.

No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; the sole issue is the indexing mismatch of the summation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the math library.
- The module comment mentions basic bounds for hyperbolic sine and cosine over complex numbers, matching the topic.
- `open Complex` allows using `sinh`, `cosh`, and `abs` for complex arguments without prefixing `Complex.`
- `theorem abs_sinh_le (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the modulus of sinh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z. In symbols, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, the modulus of cosh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z. In symbols, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to prove, for all z in C, the two inequalities |sinh z| ≤ (1/2)e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2)e^{|z|}.
- The Lean theorems exactly assert these two inequalities, with `Complex.abs` denoting |·| and `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` denoting e^{|z|}. The factor `(1 / 2 : ℝ) *` matches the 1/2 in front of e^{|z|}.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorems are stated directly. Proofs are omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable here per instructions.

Final check:
- The mathematical content and quantification match exactly. There are no generalizations, restrictions, or discrepancies.
- Therefore, the code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of the complex cosine of z is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the real cosine of the real part of z. Here `(Complex.cos z).abs` denotes |cos z| in ℂ, and `abs (Real.cos z.re)` denotes the real absolute value |cos(Re z)|.

2) Faithfulness assessment:

- No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final check:
- The mathematical content and quantification align with the natural language statement (“Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that ...” is equivalent to the universally quantified theorem). No extra assumptions or restrictions are added or omitted. Orientation of inequality is correct.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem injective_holomorphic_deriv_ne_zero (U : Set ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ)`: We consider an open set U in ℂ and a function f from ℂ to ℂ (we will restrict attention to U).
- `(hU : IsOpen U)`: U is open.
- `(hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is complex differentiable on U (within U). This matches the usual meaning of ""holomorphic on U"" in complex analysis, especially since U is open.
- `(h_inj : ∀ x y, x ∈ U → y ∈ U → f x = f y → x = y)`: f is injective when restricted to U.
- Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`: For every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f: U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U.
- The code models f as ℂ → ℂ, but restricts hypotheses (differentiability and injectivity) to U. This is a standard and faithful way to formalize a function with domain U and is an acceptable slight generalization.
- Using `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` with `IsOpen U` is appropriate for “holomorphic on U”; in mathlib, on open sets, differentiability within U implies differentiability at points of U, so `deriv f z` is the usual derivative at z for z ∈ U.
- The conclusion exactly matches “f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.”
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem is a straightforward statement with assumptions corresponding to the natural language claim. Proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for this audit focusing on statement faithfulness.

Final check:
- The two statements are mathematically the same, up to the harmless choice of treating f as defined on all of ℂ but only assuming holomorphicity and injectivity on U. No discrepancies affecting meaning.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `noncomputable section`: We will allow noncomputable definitions (irrelevant to the mathematical content).
- `noncomputable def f (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ := if n = 0 then 0 else (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)`: Define a function f depending on a complex number z and a natural number n, taking real values. It is defined by f(z, 0) = 0 (to avoid division by zero), and for n ≥ 1, f(z, n) = |z|^n / n.
- `theorem sum_abs_pow_div_le (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : ∑' n : ℕ, f z n ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of f z n is bounded above by |z|/(1 - |z|). Here ∑' denotes the (possibly infinite) sum over n = 0, 1, 2, ...

Step 2: Assess if it matches the natural language statement.
- The target statement is: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove that ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- In the Lean code, the sum is ∑'_{n ∈ ℕ} f z n, where f z 0 = 0 and for n ≥ 1, f z n = |z|^n / n. Hence, the tsum over n ≥ 0 equals 0 + ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n, i.e., exactly the intended series starting at n = 1. The assumption h: |z| < 1 matches the condition. The RHS is |z|/(1 − |z|) as desired.
- Types align: f has real values (nonnegative terms), inequality is in ℝ; this matches the intended inequality for real numbers.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing: The original sum starts at n = 1. The Lean code sums over n ∈ ℕ but defines f(0) = 0, so the effective sum is from n = 1. This is a standard and faithful formalization technique.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: f is a legitimate helper to handle the n = 0 term safely.
- The theorem statement exactly encodes the desired inequality under the hypothesis |z| < 1.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Bring in mathlib and open complex-number namespace. No issues.

- Theorem `complex_log_abs_le_tsum`:
  - Statement: For `z : ℂ` with `Complex.abs z < 1`, we have `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)`.
  - Natural language: For |z| < 1, the modulus of the principal branch log satisfies |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^n / n, where the sum is over n ∈ ℕ.
  - Note: In Lean, `∑' n : ℕ, ...` sums from n = 0. The n = 0 term here is `(abs z)^0 / 0 = 1 / 0 = 0` (since inv 0 = 0 in Lean’s fields), so this sum equals the usual ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n. Thus it faithfully represents the intended series starting at 1. Also, `Complex.log` is the principal branch, which is the standard interpretation.

- Theorem `tsum_abs_pow_div_le_geom`:
  - Statement: For `z : ℂ` with `Complex.abs z < 1`, `(∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`.
  - Natural language: For |z| < 1, ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|). As above, the inclusion of n = 0 contributes 0 and thus the series matches the one starting at 1.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement demands the chain of inequalities: |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|), for |z| < 1.
- The code provides exactly these two inequalities as separate theorems under the assumption |z| < 1, with the only technical difference being that the summation is indexed over ℕ including n = 0, but that term is 0, so it is equivalent to starting at 1. This is a standard harmless formalization detail.
- No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; both theorems are stated directly in terms of standard mathlib objects. Although proofs are `sorry`, this is allowed per the instructions as long as the statements are faithful.
- The use of `Complex.log` (principal branch) aligns with the conventional meaning of log in this context, and with |z| < 1 we have 1 − z in the right half-plane, so the principal log is well-defined; the inequality statement is standard.

Final check: The two mathematical statements match exactly (up to the benign summation index technicality), and together yield the original chain of inequalities. Therefore the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_15413 (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) :` Introduces a statement for an arbitrary complex number z and natural number n.
- `Complex.abs (((Finset.range (n+1)).sum fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z) ≤ ...` The left-hand side is the complex absolute value of the difference between the partial sum of the exponential series up to k = n and e^z. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` indexes k = 0, 1, ..., n. Each term is z^k divided by k!, with `Nat.factorial k` cast to ℂ.
- `... ≤ (Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` The right-hand side is |z|^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! (cast to ℝ), multiplied by e^{|z|}. `Complex.abs z` is a real number, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The code states exactly that for all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}. The indexing via `range (n+1)` matches k = 0..n. The absolute value and exponential functions are correctly used, with appropriate type casts from factorials to ℂ (in the sum) and ℝ (on the bound). The multiplication/ordering on the RHS matches the intended expression.

3) Final check for differences:
- Only minor type-casting differences (to ℂ in the sum and to ℝ on the bound) are present and are standard in formalization.
- The product `(|z|^(n+1) / (n+1)!) * e^{|z|}` matches the natural statement’s formatting.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it is a single theorem statement.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `theorem arg_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.arg (Complex.exp z) = z.im := by sorry` translates to: For any complex number z, the principal argument of e^z equals the imaginary part of z. Here `Complex.arg` is Mathlib's principal argument (values in (-π, π]) and `Complex.exp` is the complex exponential; `z.im` is Im z.
- `theorem abs_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re := by sorry` translates to: For any complex number z, the modulus of e^z equals e^(Re z). Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus and `Real.exp z.re` is exp of the real part of z.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asserts: For z ∈ ℂ, Arg(e^z) = Im z and |e^z| = e^{Re z}. The Lean statements assert exactly those two equalities using Mathlib’s standard functions: `Complex.arg` for Arg, `Complex.abs` for |·|, `Complex.exp` for e^z, `z.im` for Im z, and `z.re` with `Real.exp` for e^{Re z}. Thus, the translation is faithful to the given statement.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The Arg part matches exactly (Lean uses the principal Arg, which is the usual mathematical convention for Arg). Note that mathematically this equality is not true in general without reducing modulo 2π, but the natural language statement also claims the equality outright; the Lean code mirrors it faithfully.
- The modulus part matches exactly and is the standard true identity.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present; only theorem statements are given. Hence, the translation is faithful.

Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib; fine.
- Docstring explains the statement: for |z| < 1, log(1 − z) equals the negative of the power series; matches the natural language.
- `theorem complex.log_one_sub_series (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' (n : ℕ), z^(n+1) / (n+1) := by sorry`:
  - Fix a complex number `z` with `Complex.abs z < 1` (i.e., |z| < 1).
  - Claim: `Complex.log (1 - z)` equals the negative of the infinite sum `∑' (n : ℕ), z^(n+1)/(n+1)`.
  - The right-hand side is the series starting at n = 0 but with the index shifted: it is exactly `-∑_{k=1}^∞ z^k/k` after reindexing.
  - `Complex.log` denotes the principal complex logarithm, which is the standard interpretation for such statements; the region |z|<1 keeps 1−z away from the branch cut and zero, so this is consistent.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For z in C with |z| < 1, prove log(1 − z) = −∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n.
- Lean: For z : ℂ with |z|<1, `Complex.log (1 − z) = -∑' (n : ℕ), z^(n+1)/(n+1)`.
- These are mathematically identical: the Lean sum is the same series with index shifted to start at 0, and the coercions/divisions are in ℂ.

Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just a single theorem statement (proof omitted via `sorry`, which is allowed in the context of this audit).
- The statement faithfully formalizes the given result with only an innocuous reindexing of the series.
- No scope or assumption mismatches.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem exp_conj_eq : Complex.exp ((starRingEnd ℂ) z) = (starRingEnd ℂ) (Complex.exp z) := by sorry` translates to: exp(conj z) = conj(exp z), since `starRingEnd ℂ` is the ring endomorphism given by complex conjugation.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asks to show, for any z in ℂ, that e^{\overline{z}} = \overline{e^z}, sin(\overline{z}) = \overline{\sin z}, and cos(\overline{z}) = \overline{\cos z}. The Lean statements exactly assert these three equalities for an arbitrary complex number z, with `Complex.exp`, `Complex.sin`, `Complex.cos`, and `starRingEnd ℂ` representing conjugation. The universal quantification over z is captured by the theorem argument `(z : ℂ)`.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain is ℂ in both.
- Conjugation is represented by `starRingEnd ℂ`, which is standard in Mathlib and equals complex conjugation on ℂ.
- Functions exp, sin, cos match the intended ones.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or misleading definitions are introduced.
There are no substantive differences; the Lean statements are faithful translations of the natural language claims.

- There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; only theorem statements are given with omitted proofs.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- The mathematical content of both the natural language statement and the Lean theorems is the same. No generalization or specialization has been introduced. Although the inequality for cosh is in fact false (e.g., at z = 0), our task is to check translation fidelity, not truth. The translation is exact.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line to natural language.
- Theorem hasDerivAt_complex_arctan (z : ℂ) : HasDerivAt Complex.arctan (1 / (1 + z^2)) z
  Translation: For every complex number z, the complex arctangent has derivative 1/(1 + z^2) at z.

- Theorem hasDerivAt_complex_log {z : ℂ} (hz : z ∈ Complex.slitPlane) : HasDerivAt Complex.log z⁻¹ z
  Translation: For any complex number z in the slit plane (the domain of the principal branch of log), the derivative of the complex logarithm at z is z⁻¹ (i.e., 1/z).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Original: ""Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that arctan' z = 1/(1+z^2) and log'(z) = 1/z where defined.""
- The log part: The Lean theorem includes the domain condition (z ∈ Complex.slitPlane), which matches the ""where defined"" clause. Using z⁻¹ for 1/z is standard and equivalent on this domain. This is faithful.
- The arctan part: The Lean theorem asserts the derivative formula at every z ∈ ℂ without any domain restriction. For the principal complex arctan, the derivative formula holds away from the singular points where 1 + z^2 = 0 (i.e., z = ±i). The natural language statement includes a domain caveat via ""where defined"" (reasonably understood to apply to both functions), while the Lean statement omits this restriction and claims it for all z. This is a stronger (and generally false at the singular points) statement, hence not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check.
- The log statement is faithful.
- The arctan statement is missing the necessary domain restriction (e.g., z ≠ i and z ≠ -i or equivalently 1 + z^2 ≠ 0). Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the original statement in full.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to the missing domain condition for arctan; otherwise accurate.

- `theorem maximum_modulus_local {U : Set ℂ} (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (hz0 : z0 ∈ U)`: We fix an open set U in the complex plane, a function f from ℂ to ℂ, and a point z0 in ℂ with z0 ∈ U. The function f is complex differentiable on U (i.e., holomorphic on U), and U is open.
- `(hmax : ∃ r > 0, ∀ z ∈ U ∩ ball z0 r, Complex.abs (f z) ≤ Complex.abs (f z0))`: There exists a radius r > 0 such that for all z in U near z0 (specifically in U ∩ ball z0 r), |f(z)| ≤ |f(z0)|; that is, |f| attains a local maximum at z0 relative to U.
- `: ∃ r > 0, ∀ z ∈ U ∩ ball z0 r, f z = f z0`: Conclusion: There exists r > 0 such that for all z in U ∩ ball z0 r, f(z) = f(z0). So f is constant on a neighborhood of z0 within U.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U is open, f: U → ℂ is holomorphic, |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U; conclude f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
- The Lean statement assumes f : ℂ → ℂ but only requires differentiability on U, which is a standard and harmless generalization of f : U → ℂ (it only uses f on U). The local maximum condition is expressed as |f z| ≤ |f z0| for all z in U ∩ ball z0 r, matching the notion of attaining a local maximum at z0 relative to U. The conclusion provides an r > 0 such that f is constant on U ∩ ball z0 r, which is indeed a neighborhood of z0 inside U (since both U and the ball are open and z0 ∈ U ∩ ball z0 r for r > 0). Thus, the Lean statement faithfully captures the local maximum modulus principle in the requested form.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: Lean takes f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U instead of f : U → ℂ. This is a slight generalization but equivalent for the purpose of the statement, since only values on U are used.
- The conclusion is on U ∩ ball z0 r rather than ball z0 r contained in U, but since U is open, U ∩ ball z0 r is an open neighborhood of z0 in U, so this matches the intended meaning of ""constant in a neighborhood of z0"".
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are present; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `def holomorphic_on (U : Set ℂ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate for holomorphicity on U; it is defined to be True for all inputs, so it is vacuous and not Mathlib’s actual notion (e.g., `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` or `HolomorphicOn` if available).

  Statement: If U is open, f is (placeholder-)holomorphic-on U, and f is nonconstant on U (witnessed by two points in U with different values), then the image f ″ U is open. No proof provided.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: “Let U ⊂ ℂ be open and f : U → ℂ be holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f is an open mapping.” Standard meaning: f maps every open subset V ⊆ U to an open subset of ℂ (i.e., f is an open map on its domain).
- Lean theorem only asserts a specific case: IsOpen (f ″ U), i.e., the image of U itself is open. It does not quantify over all open subsets V of U. Thus, it proves much less than the open mapping property.
- Additionally, the code uses a vacuous placeholder `holomorphic_on := True`, not Mathlib’s genuine holomorphic notion. This makes the hypothesis meaningless and is a red flag per the guidelines.

Step 3: Final check
- There are two major issues:
  1) The auxiliary definition `holomorphic_on` is vacuous, violating the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate.
  2) Even if we replaced `holomorphic_on` with the correct Mathlib predicate, the theorem only asserts openness of f(U), not that f is an open map (i.e., for all open V ⊆ U, f(V) is open). Hence, the statement is not faithful to the original.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation of the natural language theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem injective_holomorphic_deriv_ne_zero {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ}`: We fix an open subset U of the complex plane and a function f from ℂ to ℂ.
- `(hU : IsOpen U)`: Assume U is open.
- `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: Assume f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.

- `: ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`: Conclude that for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

This matches the usual interpretation that `deriv` is the complex derivative when the scalar field is ℂ, and `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` captures holomorphicity on U.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ open; f: U → ℂ holomorphic and injective; show f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U.
- Lean: Uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability only on U, and assumes global injectivity `Injective f`. The conclusion matches: derivative is nonzero for all z ∈ U.

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- The only discrepancy is the injectivity domain: the NL statement requires injectivity as a map U → ℂ (i.e., injective on U), while the Lean code assumes injectivity on all of ℂ. This is a stronger hypothesis than necessary, i.e., a slight specialization. Everything else aligns: open set U, holomorphic (differentiable on U), and the correct conclusion about nonvanishing derivative on U. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the theorem statement is legitimate and standard in Mathlib terms.

Given the guidelines allowing slight specialization/generalization, this counts as a faithful translation with a minor strengthening of assumptions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem discrete_set_of_deriv_eq_zero {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (h : ¬∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c) : ...` 
  Means: Let U be an open subset of ℂ, and f : ℂ → ℂ is complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic on U). Assume f is not constant on U.
- Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z = 0 → ∃ ε > 0, (Metric.ball z ε ∩ U ∩ {w | deriv f w = 0}) = {z}`
  Means: For every z in U such that the complex derivative of f at z is zero, there exists ε > 0 so that in the open ε-ball around z, when intersected with U, the set of points where the derivative vanishes is exactly {z}. Equivalently, each critical point is isolated within U.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f non-constant. Show the set {z ∈ U : f'(z) = 0} is discrete in U.
- Lean formalization: Uses f : ℂ → ℂ together with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` to represent holomorphic on U, and non-constancy on U via `¬∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c`. The conclusion expresses discreteness explicitly via isolation: for each critical point z ∈ U there is ε > 0 such that within U, the only point in a small ball with derivative zero is z. This is exactly the standard characterization of a discrete subset in the subspace U.
- The use of `Metric.ball z ε ∩ U ∩ {w | deriv f w = 0} = {z}` precisely captures discreteness in U. The derivative is the complex derivative (inferred by types). The minor technical shift from f : U → ℂ to f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability on U is standard and faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: natural language has f : U → ℂ; code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability on U. This is a standard formalization choice and does not change meaning.
- Holomorphic vs DifferentiableOn: In Mathlib, `DifferentiableOn ℂ` on an open set matches holomorphic. OK.
- Non-constant: Matches exactly as not constant on U.
- Discreteness notion: The code encodes the isolation property within U, which is equivalent to discreteness. OK.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary fake constructs.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib.
- variable {U : Set Complex} (hU : IsOpen U) {f g : Complex → Complex} (S : Set Complex) (x : Complex): We fix an open set U in ℂ (hU states U is open), functions f, g: ℂ → ℂ, a subset S of ℂ, and a point x ∈ ℂ. Note: hU, S, x are declared as variables in scope, but only some appear in the theorem.
- def holomorphic_on (f : Complex → Complex) (U : Set Complex) : Prop := True: Placeholder predicate; it always holds. Not the real notion of holomorphic on U.
- def has_accumulation_point (S : Set Complex) (x : Complex) : Prop := True: Placeholder predicate; it always holds. Not the real notion of x being an accumulation point of S (and it does not mention U).
- theorem identity_theorem (hf : holomorphic_on f U) (hg : holomorphic_on g U) (hS : S ⊆ U)
    (hacc : has_accumulation_point S x) (heq : ∀ z ∈ S, f z = g z) : ∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z := by sorry
  Translation: If f and g are ""holomorphic on U"" (with the placeholder predicate), S ⊆ U, x is an accumulation point of S (with the placeholder predicate), and f = g on S, then f = g on U.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Target statement: U ⊆ ℂ is open; f, g: U → ℂ are holomorphic; if S ⊆ U has an accumulation point in U and f = g on S, then f ≡ g on U.

Issues:
- The code uses vacuous placeholders for both holomorphic_on and has_accumulation_point. These make the hypotheses meaningless, violating the guideline that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous.
- The theorem does not use the openness assumption hU; the hypothesis IsOpen U does not appear in the theorem statement. The natural language requires U open.
- The code models functions as f, g : ℂ → ℂ with a predicate ""holomorphic_on f U"" rather than functions U → ℂ that are holomorphic. This is acceptable if holomorphic_on is the standard Mathlib notion, but here it is a vacuous placeholder.
- The statement ""S has an accumulation point in U"" in the natural language requires existence of some x ∈ U that is an accumulation point of S. The Lean statement uses a fixed x with has_accumulation_point S x but does not assume x ∈ U (nor does the placeholder carry this information). Therefore, even with a non-placeholder definition, the Lean statement would be missing the requirement x ∈ U.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable under the brief, but the problems above already break faithfulness.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code replaces key notions by vacuous True predicates and omits the necessary condition that the accumulation point lies in U, and it fails to enforce that U is open in the theorem. Hence, it is not a faithful translation.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem holomorphic_zero_isolated_or_constant takes:
  - U : Set Complex and hU : IsOpen U (U is open in ℂ).
  - f : Complex → Complex (a function on all of ℂ, not restricted to U).
  - z0 c : Complex (a point and a complex number).
  - hhol : True (placeholder standing in for “f is holomorphic on U” or similar; currently vacuous).
  - hnc : True (placeholder for “f is nonconstant”; vacuous).
  - hval : f z0 = c (value condition at z0).
  - hder : True (placeholder for “f'(z0)=0”; vacuous).
- Conclusion: (∀ z, f z = c) ∨ (∃ (m : ℕ) (V : Set Complex), 1 ≤ m ∧ IsOpen V ∧ z0 ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ True ∧ True).
  That is, either f is the constant function c on all of ℂ, or there exist a positive integer m and an open set V containing z0, with V ⊆ U, and two additional assertions both stated as True (placeholders), with no content.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ is a domain (open, connected; often nonempty too). The code only assumes IsOpen U, no connectedness or nonemptiness.
- f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant. The code has f : ℂ → ℂ (wrong domain), and replaces “holomorphic” and “nonconstant” with vacuous True hypotheses. It also does not assume z0 ∈ U (needed for derivative at z0 in this context), though the conclusion later forces z0 ∈ V ⊆ U.
- Hypotheses f(z0)=c and f'(z0)=0: the value at z0 matches, but the derivative condition is replaced by True.
- Conclusion: either f ≡ c on U or else z0 is a zero of f−c of order m and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity). The code’s first disjunct says f is constant on all of ℂ, not just on U. The second disjunct only asserts existence of m ≥ 1 and open V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, but the key mathematical content—“z0 is a zero of order m” and “the preimage consists of exactly m points counted with multiplicity”—is replaced by two vacuous True placeholders, giving no actual content.
- Additionally, the theorem is stated with by sorry (no proof), which is acceptable per instructions, but the placeholders (True) in hypotheses and conclusions are not.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- No. There are multiple discrepancies:
  - Domain mismatch for f (ℂ → ℂ vs U → ℂ) and scope of the constant conclusion (∀ z in ℂ vs on U).
  - Missing domain properties: connectedness (domain), possibly nonempty.
  - Holomorphic, nonconstant, and derivative zero conditions are vacuous (True), not encoded.
  - The central conclusions about order of zero and multiplicity of preimage points are not formalized; they are replaced by True.
  - z0 ∈ U is not assumed up front.
These issues render the translation unfaithful.

Given the extensive use of vacuous placeholders and several structural mismatches (domain of f, scope of constancy, missing core conclusions), this is not a faithful translation.

- import Mathlib; open Complex: Set up and open the Complex namespace.

  Translation: Assuming the placeholder hypotheses that U is a domain and f is holomorphic on U (both vacuous), the theorem asserts: for every z in U, there exist coefficients a : ℕ → ℂ and a real number r such that r = 0 and some trivial True holds. There is no mention of power series, convergence, equality to f, or any radius related to distance to a singularity/boundary; it explicitly forces r = 0.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is a domain and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic, then f is analytic on U; i.e., around each z ∈ U, f has a Taylor series with radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity, and the series sums to f on the disk.
- The code uses vacuous placeholders for both “domain” and “holomorphic,” violating the requirement for legitimate definitions.
- The theorem’s conclusion is drastically different: it claims existence of coefficients and a radius but forces r = 0 and provides no content about convergence or equality to f. This is not merely incomplete; it contradicts the intended radius condition and omits the essential analytic/summation assertions.
- Even ignoring the placeholders, the stated goal (∃ a r, r = 0 ∧ True) is not a faithful formalization of analyticity and the radius being the distance to the nearest singularity.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. Differences:
- The code makes the premises vacuous (Domain, HolomorphicOn are True) so it does not genuinely assume U is an open connected subset of ℂ nor that f is holomorphic.
- The conclusion in the code only asserts existence of a sequence and a radius equal to 0 with no relation to Taylor series, no convergence, no equality to f, and no radius characterization. This is in direct conflict with the original statement’s requirements.
- The comment in the docstring mentions “distance to the complement,” which is not enforced in the formal statement, and the actual formal statement says r = 0, not distance to any singularity/boundary.

Auxiliary definitions: Both are vacuous placeholders. The theorem also has a vacuous and incorrect target. Even if the placeholders were replaced by correct Mathlib notions, the theorem’s conclusion would remain unfaithful (r = 0).

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

  - Bijective g (g is a global bijection ℂ → ℂ),
  - ∀ z ∈ V, g z ∈ W (g maps V into W),

  - ∀ z ∈ W, f (g z) = z (g is a right-inverse of f on W),
  - DifferentiableOn ℂ g U (g is holomorphic on U).

- The original statement: For U open in ℂ, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for p ∈ U, there exist neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p) such that f : V → W is a bijection and f⁻¹ is holomorphic (on W).

Key discrepancies:
1) Domain of f:
   - Natural: f : U → ℂ.
   - Lean: f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. This generalization is acceptable only if the local result is restricted to V ⊆ U. However, the Lean statement never requires V ⊆ U.
2) Bijection/local inverse formulation:
   - Natural: f restricts to a bijection V → W with inverse g : W → V.
   - Lean: Introduces a global g : ℂ → ℂ that is Bijective on ℂ. This is far stronger and unrelated to the local inverse one needs.
3) Direction of g’s image condition:
   - Natural: g : W → V (so g(W) ⊆ V).
   - Lean: ∀ z ∈ V, g z ∈ W (so g(V) ⊆ W), which is the opposite direction and not what is needed for an inverse W → V.
4) Missing mapping condition for f:
   - Natural: f(V) ⊆ W.
   - Lean: No such condition is stated; instead, the identity g (f z) = z for z ∈ V relies on g being globally defined and does not force f(V) ⊆ W.
5) Holomorphy of the inverse:
   - Natural: f⁻¹ is holomorphic on W.
   - Lean: DifferentiableOn ℂ g U (g holomorphic on U), which is the wrong domain and does not express holomorphy of the inverse on W.
6) Neighborhoods openness:
   - Natural: neighborhoods (typically open). Lean uses V ∈ 𝓝 p and W ∈ 𝓝 f(p), which is acceptable as a formulation of neighborhoods. This point is fine.

Conclusion:
The Lean statement is not a faithful formalization. It imposes an irrelevant and overly strong global bijectivity of g, has the direction of g’s mapping reversed, fails to ensure f maps V into W, and puts the holomorphy of the inverse on the wrong set (U instead of W). It also doesn’t ensure V ⊆ U. These are substantive mismatches.

Final check: The two problems are different in multiple essential ways; the Lean code does not faithfully capture the inverse function theorem in the stated form.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: U : Set ℂ, z0 : ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ. Assumptions:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open in ℂ.
  - hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U — f is holomorphic on U.
  - h_nonconst : ∃ w ∈ U, f w ≠ f z0 — f is not constant on U (equivalently, there is some point in U where f takes a value different from f z0).
  - hz0 : z0 ∈ U — z0 lies in U.
  - hder : deriv f z0 = 0 — f′(z0) = 0.
- Conclusion: There exist n : ℕ, V : Set ℂ, g : ℂ → ℂ such that:
  - 0 < n — the order is a positive integer (finite and at least 1).
  - IsOpen V ∧ z0 ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U — V is an open neighborhood of z0 contained in U.
  - AnalyticOn ℂ g V — g is holomorphic on V.
  - g z0 ≠ 0 — g does not vanish at z0.
  - ∀ z ∈ V, deriv f z = (z - z0)^n * g z — on V, f′ factors as a power of (z − z0) times a holomorphic nonvanishing function.

This is exactly the standard definition that z0 is a zero of order n of the holomorphic function f′. The code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with AnalyticOn ℂ f U rather than f : U → ℂ, which is a common and faithful formalization strategy; the conclusion only concerns points in V ⊆ U, so values outside U are irrelevant. The non-const assumption is expressed as ∃ w ∈ U, f w ≠ f z0, which is equivalent to “f is not constant on U” given z0 ∈ U.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to show that if f is holomorphic on an open U, not constant, and f′(z0)=0, then z0 is a zero of f′ of some finite order. 
- The Lean statement precisely asserts the existence of n > 0 and a local factorization of f′ as (z − z0)^n times a holomorphic g with g(z0) ≠ 0 on a neighborhood V ⊆ U. This is the standard formal definition of “z0 is a zero of f′ of order n.”

Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain formalization (f : ℂ → ℂ with AnalyticOn on U vs f : U → ℂ) is a harmless formalization detail and does not change the meaning.
- The statement includes explicit existence of V and g, which is the canonical way to express “zero of finite order” formally. 
- Both the natural statement and the code use the same “not constant” assumption (no extra connectedness assumption is introduced or omitted differently between them). Thus, the code is faithful to the statement as written.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a legitimate and faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: U : Set ℂ, p : ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U — U is open in ℂ.
  - hp : p ∈ U — p belongs to U.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U — f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
  - hfp : deriv f p ≠ 0 — the complex derivative of f at p (as a function ℂ → ℂ) is nonzero.
- Conclusion:
  - ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ Set.InjOn f V — there exists an open set V in ℂ containing p such that f is injective on V.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, p ∈ U, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(p) ≠ 0. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that f restricted to V is injective. Since f is only defined on U, this implicitly means V ⊆ U (an open neighborhood of p in the subspace U) and the restriction f|_V is injective.

- Lean code differences:
  1) Domain of f: The code takes f : ℂ → ℂ and assumes DifferentiableOn f U. This is a standard formalization of “f : U → ℂ is holomorphic.” This part is fine.
  2) Derivative: The code uses deriv f p (global derivative). Given U is open and hf, this matches the intended f'(p). Fine.
  3) Missing inclusion V ⊆ U: The conclusion in Lean does not require V ⊆ U, whereas the natural statement (with f : U → ℂ) implicitly requires V ⊆ U so that the restriction f|_V is meaningful. Thus, the Lean statement is slightly weaker: it asserts the existence of some open neighborhood V (not necessarily contained in U) on which f (as a global function) is injective. While one can choose V ⊆ U in practice, the statement does not assert that. This is the key discrepancy.

Final check:
- Aside from omitting V ⊆ U, all other aspects faithfully reflect the original mathematical content. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; Mathlib notions are used appropriately. The omission makes the formal statement weaker than the original, so it is not perfectly faithful but is very close and in the standard direction of formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: load mathlib and open the complex namespace.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem holomorphic_on_analytic (U : Set ℂ) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (z0 : ℂ) (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) : AnalyticAt ℂ f z0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let U be an open subset of ℂ and f : ℂ → ℂ be complex differentiable on U. For any point z0 ∈ U, f is analytic at z0 (i.e., there exists a power series expansion of f around z0 that converges to f on some neighborhood of z0). No other auxiliary definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The code faithfully captures the part “If f is holomorphic on a domain U ⊂ ℂ, then f is analytic,” localized at an arbitrary z0 ∈ U. In mathlib, `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` is the standard formalization of “holomorphic on U,” and `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0` expresses “f has a convergent power series expansion at z0 whose sum equals f in some neighborhood of z0.” Also, the code assumes `IsOpen U`, and while the natural language uses “domain” (usually open and connected), connectedness is not required for the local analyticity conclusion, so this is a harmless generalization.
- However, the original statement contains additional, stronger assertions that the code does not formalize: (i) the existence of a Taylor series with radius of convergence R equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and (ii) that the series converges on the full disk {z : |z - z0| < R} and sums to f on that entire disk. The Lean statement merely asserts analyticity at a point (existence of a power series valid on some neighborhood), but does not address the exact radius of convergence nor its identification with the distance to the nearest singularity, nor the maximal domain of convergence.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: holomorphic implies analytic (locally at each point).
- Different: the code omits the key quantitative part about the radius of convergence being the distance to the nearest singularity and the precise domain of convergence and equality of the sum on that maximal disk. Also, it does not mention connectedness of U (minor, since not needed for the local implication).

Conclusion: The code captures only the first (local analyticity) portion of the natural language theorem, missing the essential radius-of-convergence/nearest-singularity claim. Hence it is not a fully faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, p : ℂ, f' : ℂ.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : IsOpen U (U is open in ℂ).
  - hp : p ∈ U (p is a point of U).
  - hder : HasDerivAt f f' p (f has complex derivative f' at p).
  - hneq : f' ≠ 0 (the derivative at p is nonzero).
- Conclusion: ∃ V : Set ℂ, such that
  - IsOpen V (V is open),
  - p ∈ V (p is in V),
  - V ⊆ U (V is contained in U),
  - IsOpen (f '' V) (the image f(V) is open in ℂ),
  - ∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y (f restricted to V is injective).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ is open; f : U → ℂ is holomorphic; pick p ∈ U with f'(p) ≠ 0. Then there is an open neighborhood V of p (implicitly V ⊆ U) such that f(V) is open and f|_V is injective.
- Matches:
  - U open, p ∈ U, and f'(p) ≠ 0 are reflected as IsOpen U, p ∈ U, HasDerivAt f f' p with f' ≠ 0.
  - Existence of an open neighborhood V of p, with V ⊆ U, and injectivity of f on V is correctly encoded.
  - The openness of f(V) is explicitly required: IsOpen (f '' V).
- Discrepancies:
  - Domain of f: The natural statement has f : U → ℂ, holomorphic on U. The Lean code has f : ℂ → ℂ but restricts the neighborhood V to lie in U. This modeling is acceptable.
  - Crucial missing hypothesis: The natural statement assumes f is holomorphic on U (i.e., complex differentiable on an open set), whereas the Lean code only assumes HasDerivAt f f' p, i.e., complex differentiable at the single point p. There is no assumption that f is holomorphic (or even differentiable/analytic) on a neighborhood of p or on U. This is a significant weakening of the hypotheses. The classical result (local injectivity/openness) relies on f being holomorphic in a neighborhood of p (e.g., via the holomorphic inverse function theorem or open mapping theorem), not merely differentiable at one point.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem asserts a stronger conclusion from weaker hypotheses than the natural statement, by dropping the key assumption that f is holomorphic on U. This is not a mere slight generalization; it changes the meaning materially. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem inj_on_ball_of_hasDerivAt_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {p f' : ℂ}`: We consider a function f defined on all of ℂ, a point p ∈ ℂ, and a complex number f' intended to be the complex derivative at p.
- `(h : HasDerivAt f f' p)`: f has (complex) derivative f' at p (pointwise differentiability at p).
- `(hne : f' ≠ 0)`: The derivative at p is nonzero.
- `: ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ Set.InjOn f (Metric.ball p δ)`: There exists δ > 0 such that f is injective on the open metric ball centered at p with radius δ (i.e., the open disc Δ_δ(p)).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let U ⊂ ℂ be open and f : U → ℂ holomorphic. If p ∈ U and f'(p) ≠ 0, then for sufficiently small δ > 0, f restricted to Δ_δ(p) is injective (implicitly Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U for small δ).

Lean code differences:
- Domain: The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ (entire domain), whereas the natural statement works on an open subset U ⊂ ℂ. The code does not mention U or the need for the ball to lie in U.
- Regularity assumptions: The natural statement assumes f is holomorphic on an open set U (i.e., complex differentiable in a neighborhood of p). The Lean code only assumes `HasDerivAt f f' p`, i.e., differentiable at the single point p, with no neighborhood holomorphy. This is a strictly weaker hypothesis; the theorem in this form is generally false without additional regularity (holomorphic/analytic in a neighborhood) and thus is not a faithful translation of the assumptions.
- Conclusion form: The code asserts existence of some δ > 0 making f injective on the ball. The phrasing ""for sufficiently small δ > 0"" is typically interpreted as there exists δ₀ > 0 such that for all 0 < δ ≤ δ₀, the property holds. Since injectivity is monotone under restriction to smaller sets, existence of one δ does imply the property for all smaller δ, so this part is essentially fine.

Step 3: Final check of sameness vs difference.
- Missing open set U and holomorphicity: The code removes the open-set context and holomorphic hypothesis, replacing it with pointwise differentiability only. This is a substantive change in assumptions.
- Domain issue: The code's domain is all ℂ, not an open subset U; it does not ensure the ball lies inside U (since U is absent). While one could specialize to the case U = ℂ, that is a specialization of the natural statement; however, the code also weakens the differentiability assumption, making the overall statement not a faithful translation.
- Conclusion target (injectivity on an open ball) matches the intended conclusion modulo the domain discrepancy.

Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation: it drops critical hypotheses (holomorphic on an open set) and changes the setting to a global function with only pointwise differentiability at p.

Theorem open_mapping_holomorphic:
- Inputs:
  - U : Set ℂ, hU : IsOpen U (U is open), hconn : IsConnected U (U is connected).
  - f : ℂ → ℂ (a function on the complex plane), hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (f is complex-differentiable/holomorphic on U), hnonconst : ¬ ∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c (f is not constant on U).
- Conclusion: IsOpen (f '' U) (the image f(U) is open in ℂ).
So this is the open mapping theorem for a nonconstant holomorphic function on an open, connected U (even though connectedness is not strictly necessary for openness, it matches the natural language hypotheses).

Theorem locally_injective_of_deriv_ne_zero:
- Inputs:
  - U : Set ℂ, hU : IsOpen U; p : ℂ with hp : p ∈ U.
  - f : ℂ → ℂ; hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (f is holomorphic on U).
  - hder : ∃ f', HasDerivAt f f' p ∧ f' ≠ 0 (the complex derivative of f at p exists and is nonzero).
- Conclusion: ∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y). That is, there is an open neighborhood V of p contained in U on which f is injective. This is exactly “f is locally injective at p when f'(p) ≠ 0”.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ is open and connected; f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant.
  - Then: (1) f(U) is open. (2) f is locally injective at all points where f'(p) ≠ 0.
- Lean version:
  - Uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This is a standard formalization of a map defined on U by extending it arbitrarily outside U; it’s equivalent for these statements.
  - Nonconstancy is expressed as “not (∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c)”, which precisely means f is not constant on U.
  - The first theorem asserts f(U) is open under those hypotheses: matches.
  - The second theorem asserts local injectivity at points with nonzero derivative: matches the intended meaning and even holds under weaker assumptions (doesn’t need connectedness or global nonconstancy), which is acceptable and faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Minor formalization differences:
  - f is taken as ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U instead of f : U → ℂ holomorphic. This is a standard and faithful way to encode holomorphicity on an open set.
  - The second theorem is stated with weaker hypotheses than the initial global setup, but it implies the desired statement in the original context. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.
- No discrepancies in mathematical meaning: both the open mapping part and the local injectivity where f'(p) ≠ 0 are correctly captured.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `open Filter` and the variables just set up notation: f : ℂ → ℂ and L : ℂ.
- The theorem statement: `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.cocompact ℂ) (nhds L)` means “f tends to L as z tends to ∞ in the one-point compactification (Riemann sphere) sense”; here the domain filter is the cocompact filter on ℂ (approaching infinity), and the target filter is `nhds L` (the usual neighborhood filter of L in ℂ).
- The right-hand side: `∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : ℂ, ‖z‖ > M → ‖f z - L‖ < ε` is exactly the ε–M characterization: for every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all z with |z| > M we have |f(z) − L| < ε. Here `Norm.norm` is the usual absolute value/norm on ℂ, so this matches |·|.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says “lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff the ε–M condition with |z| > M holds.” The Lean statement gives an exact equivalence between tending to L along the cocompact filter (which formalizes approaching ∞ in the one-point compactification/Riemann sphere sense) and the ε–M condition with |z| > M.
- The target is ℂ with its usual topology (`nhds L`), matching the intended meaning.
- The use of `>` rather than `≥` in the condition on |z| is a harmless conventional variation; the statements are equivalent.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct and uses standard Mathlib notions (`Filter.cocompact`, `nhds`).

3) Final check: The two statements are the same. Both assert the equivalence between the Riemann sphere limit at ∞ (formalized via the cocompact filter) and the ε–M condition stated with the complex norm. There are no mismatches or missing qualifications.

Right side: for every sequence u: ℕ → α and every point x ∈ α, if every term u n lies in s and u converges to x in α (expressed as Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)), then x ∈ s. In other words, every sequence in s that converges in α has its limit in s.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language claim is: In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S.
- The Lean right-hand side exactly formalizes “every sequence in s that converges in α has its limit in s,” using `Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)` to denote convergence of the sequence u to x in the ambient space α.
- The equivalence ↔ matches the “if and only if.”
- Quantifying over all x with `Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)` is equivalent to saying “the limit lies in s” in metric spaces (Hausdorff), since if u converges to x, that x is the (unique) limit.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions (IsClosed, Tendsto, atTop, nhds).
- The theorem statement faithfully matches the natural language statement with no substantive discrepancies.

  - f : Complex → Complex, hf : DifferentiableOn Complex f U — f is holomorphic on U.
  - p : Complex, hp : p ∈ U — p is a point in U.

  - DifferentiableOn Complex g W — g is holomorphic on W.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: If U ⊆ C is open, f : U → C holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U, then there exist open sets V, W ⊆ C with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, and f|_V is injective with a holomorphic inverse.

The Lean statement exactly encodes this:
- U open, f holomorphic on U, p ∈ U, f'(p) ≠ 0: matches hU, hf, hp, hfp.
- Existence of open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U and f(V) = W: matches IsOpen V, IsOpen W, p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f '' V = W.
- f|_V injective: encoded by the injectivity predicate on V.
- Existence of a holomorphic inverse: g with f ∘ g = id on W and g ∘ f = id on V, and DifferentiableOn g W (holomorphic on W). This is exactly a holomorphic inverse for the restriction of f to V.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The code uses DifferentiableOn Complex to represent holomorphic — standard in Mathlib.
- deriv f p ≠ 0 is the non-vanishing complex derivative at p — matches f'(p) ≠ 0.
- The inverse g is typed as Complex → Complex but specified to be an inverse only on W and holomorphic on W; this is a standard formalization and is equivalent to having g : W → V. From the provided identities and f '' V = W, one can deduce g maps W into V.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions. The statement is faithful and precise, possibly even a bit more explicit (two-sided inverse and holomorphicity).

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem parameters: real numbers a, b; functions γ : ℝ → ℂ and θ : ℝ → ℝ. The intended domain [a,b] is modeled by adding hypotheses on Set.Icc a b.
- h_cont: γ is ContinuousOn [a,b]. This is weaker than the stated “piecewise smooth.”
- h_nonzero: γ t ≠ 0 for all t ∈ [a,b]. This matches “does not go through the origin.”
- h_theta: for all t ∈ [a,b], exp(i θ(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)|. This matches the given relation.
- is_simple : Prop. This is just an arbitrary proposition, not tied to γ, and it is not used subsequently.
- origin_in_region : Prop. This is an arbitrary proposition intended to stand for “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ,” but it is not defined in terms of γ or any geometry/topology.
- Conclusion: there exists tilde_θ : ℝ → ℝ such that for all t ∈ [a,b], exp(i tilde_θ(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)|, and tilde_θ(a) = θ(a), and (tilde_θ(b) = tilde_θ(a) + 2π) ↔ origin_in_region.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Domain: The Lean code models functions on ℝ with constraints to [a,b], which is fine.
- Regularity: The statement assumes γ is piecewise smooth and simple (typically meaning a simple closed curve for the “region bounded by γ” to make sense). The Lean code only assumes continuity, and does not enforce simplicity or that the curve is closed (e.g., γ(a) = γ(b)). This is a substantive mismatch.
- Non-vanishing: Matches via h_nonzero.
- Angle relation: Matches via h_theta.
- Existence of a lift tilde_θ with tilde_θ(a) = θ(a): Matches the spirit, though continuity of tilde_θ is not asserted (the original doesn’t explicitly require continuity either).
- The crucial “iff the origin is inside the region bounded by γ” is replaced by an arbitrary proposition origin_in_region, not defined in terms of γ. This is a placeholder and not a faithful formalization of the geometric condition.
- The parameter is_simple is an unused arbitrary Prop and does not enforce simplicity.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is not faithful: it weakens the hypotheses (continuity instead of piecewise smooth; no simplicity; no closedness), and it replaces the geometric condition with an arbitrary, unrelated Prop. The key geometric content about the region bounded by γ is not formalized at all. Thus, the two problems are different in essential ways.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `theorem exists_compact_exhaustion_of_open (U : Set Complex) (hU : IsOpen U) :` states: For an open set U in the complex plane, there exists ...
- `∃ K : ℕ → Set Complex,` there exists a sequence (indexed by ℕ) of subsets of ℂ, K n.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n))` each K n is compact.
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))` the sequence is strictly increasing in the sense K_n is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.
- `(U = ⋃ n, interior (K n))` U is the union of the interiors of the K n.
- `(∀ n, ∃ m : ℕ, ∃ c : Fin m → Complex, ∃ r : Fin m → ℝ, K n ⊆ ⋃ i, Metric.closedBall (c i) (r i) ∧ (⋃ i, Metric.closedBall (c i) (r i)) ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))` for each n, there is a finite family of closed balls (disks) in ℂ covering K n and contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.
No auxiliary definitions are introduced; all concepts (IsOpen, IsCompact, interior, closedBall, union) are standard Mathlib.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural: U is open subset of ℂ. Matches `U : Set Complex, hU : IsOpen U`.
- There exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U: Code asserts compactness. Does it ensure K_n ⊆ U? Yes: from U = ⋃ n interior(K n), we have interior(K n) ⊆ U for each n (each term is contained in the union). Then K_n ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}) ⊆ U, so indeed K_n ⊆ U. Thus the code implies K_n are compact subsets of U.
- K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}^o: Exactly `K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))`.
- U = ⋃ K_n^o: Exactly `(U = ⋃ n, interior (K n))`.
- For each n there exists a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊆ ⋃ D_{kn} ⊆ K_{n+1}^o: Exactly modeled by finite index `Fin m` with centers `c` and radii `r`, using `Metric.closedBall (c i) (r i)`. The finiteness is captured by `Fin m`. Closed disks in ℂ correspond to metric closed balls.
The indexing starts at ℕ (0-based) rather than from 1, which is a harmless convention change.
Not requiring r ≥ 0 is fine, since existence allows choosing nonnegative radii; it does not weaken the statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only potential concern is not explicitly stating K_n ⊆ U, but as noted, it follows from the given properties. Everything else matches precisely.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The theorem has an omitted proof (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem outer_measure_union_null {α : Type*} (m : Set α → ENNReal)` defines a statement for an arbitrary type α and a set function m from subsets of α to extended nonnegative reals.
- `(m_mono : ∀ {s t : Set α}, s ⊆ t → m s ≤ m t)` assumes monotonicity of m: if s ⊆ t then m(s) ≤ m(t).
- `(m_union_add : ∀ s t : Set α, m (s ∪ t) ≤ m s + m t)` assumes finite subadditivity for unions: the measure of a union is at most the sum of the measures.
- `{A B : Set α} (hB : m B = 0) : m (A ∪ B) = m A` states the goal: if B has measure zero, then m(A ∪ B) = m(A).
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but the statement itself is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For the outer measure m* on ℝ^n, if B has outer measure 0, then m*(A ∪ B) = m*(A).
- The Lean statement is a slight generalization: it works for any type α and any set function m that is monotone and (finitely) subadditive on unions. Outer measures satisfy these properties (monotone and countably subadditive, hence finitely subadditive). Therefore, the Lean theorem directly applies to m* on ℝ^n and proves exactly the desired equality.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: The Lean code works in full generality (any α, any monotone subadditive m) rather than specifically an outer measure on ℝ^n. This is a benign generalization and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; there are no auxiliary definitions beyond the hypotheses, and all are legitimate.
- Conclusion: The formal statement faithfully captures the intended mathematical claim (indeed in a slightly more general form).

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code.
- `lemma tendsto_norm_atTop_iff {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ} :` We fix a complex-valued function f on ℂ and a point z0 ∈ ℂ.
- `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) atTop ↔ ...` The statement claims an equivalence: the norm of f tends to +∞ (in ℝ) as z tends to z0 with respect to the neighborhood filter `nhds z0` if and only if ...
- Right-hand side: `∀ M : ℝ, 0 < M → ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ ∀ z : ℂ, ‖z - z0‖ < δ → ‖f z‖ > M` For every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with |z − z0| < δ, we have |f(z)| > M.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The intended left-hand side in natural language is: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere.” This is equivalent to saying |f(z)| → ∞ as z → z0, but crucially with z approaching z0 in a punctured sense (i.e., excluding z0), corresponding to the filter 𝓝[≠] z0.
- The Lean statement uses `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) atTop`, which is the non-punctured neighborhood filter. This is too strong and in fact impossible for an ℝ-valued function defined at z0 (since any neighborhood contains z0, one would require ‖f z0‖ > M for all M). Thus it does not formalize the usual notion of limit as z→z0.
- The right-hand side in Lean uses the condition `‖z - z0‖ < δ` (non-punctured), whereas the standard ε-δ characterization of a limit as z→z0 should include `0 < ‖z - z0‖ < δ`. The natural-language quantifier also omitted the “0 <” part, but the phrase “lim as z→z0” implicitly means punctured neighborhoods. So the Lean RHS matches the literal text but not the intended limit notion.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Main discrepancy: The Lean left side uses `nhds z0` instead of the punctured filter `𝓝[≠] z0`. This fails to capture the Riemann sphere limit notion and makes the statement false for ordinary functions ℂ → ℂ.
- Secondary discrepancy: The Lean right side lacks the punctured condition `0 < ‖z - z0‖`, which is standard for limits. This mirrors the literal wording but not the intended meaning tied to limits.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the statement is otherwise well-typed and uses standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. A faithful version would be, for example:
- `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop ↔ ∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, 0 < ‖z - z0‖ ∧ ‖z - z0‖ < δ → ‖f z‖ > M`, or equivalently phrased via the Riemann sphere target.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `theorem zeros_are_isolated_and_local_factor {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) {c : ℂ} : ...`
  Means: Let U be an open subset of ℂ, f: ℂ → ℂ a function that is complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic on U), and c ∈ ℂ. Then the following two statements hold.

- First conjunct: `(∀ p, p ∈ U → f p = c → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, z ∈ U ∩ Metric.ball p δ → z ≠ p → f z ≠ c)`
  Means: For every p ∈ U with f(p) = c, there exists δ > 0 such that in U ∩ the open ball around p of radius δ, the only solution of f(z) = c is z = p. In other words, zeros of f − c are isolated in U.

- Second conjunct: `(∀ p, p ∈ U → f p = c → ∃ (δ : ℝ) (k : ℕ) (g : ℂ → ℂ), 0 < δ ∧ DifferentiableOn ℂ g (Metric.ball p δ) ∧ (∀ z ∈ Metric.ball p δ, f z - c = (z - p) ^ k * g z) ∧ g p ≠ 0)`
  Means: For every p ∈ U with f(p) = c, there exist δ > 0, a natural number k, and a function g: ℂ → ℂ that is complex-differentiable on the open ball of radius δ around p such that for all z in that ball we have f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z), and moreover g(p) ≠ 0. This is the standard local factorization of a holomorphic function around a zero: f(z) − c factors as (z − p)^k times a holomorphic function nonvanishing at p.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement asserts: given open U ⊆ ℂ and holomorphic f: U → ℂ and c ∈ ℂ, the zero set {z ∈ U : f(z) = c} is discrete; furthermore, if p ∈ U with f(p) = c, there exist δ > 0, k ∈ ℕ, and a holomorphic g on the disk Δ_δ(p) such that f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z) for all z in the disk, with g not identically zero and g(p) ≠ 0.
- The first conjunct of the Lean theorem exactly captures the discreteness: for each zero p, there is a punctured neighborhood in U with no other zeros. This is equivalent to discreteness of the zero set in U (and in fact in ℂ, since S ⊆ U and we obtain ball ∩ S = {p}).
- The second conjunct matches the local factorization: existence of δ, k, and a holomorphic g on the ball such that f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z) for all z in that ball, and g(p) ≠ 0. The condition “g not identically zero” is implied by g(p) ≠ 0.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain of f: The Lean code takes f: ℂ → ℂ with holomorphy only on U; the natural language has f: U → ℂ. This is a standard slight generalization and is acceptable.
- Scope of the equality in the factorization: Lean states it for all z in the ball (no intersection with U) because f is globally defined; in the classical statement, the ball is taken inside U anyway. This is a harmless strengthening and consistent with the intended result.
- Holomorphic vs DifferentiableOn: In mathlib, DifferentiableOn ℂ on an open set matches “holomorphic.”
- The condition “g not identically zero” is not stated explicitly but follows from g(p) ≠ 0. The NL statement also explicitly requires g(p) ≠ 0, which Lean includes.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (slight generalization in the function’s global domain and the scope of the equality), with no vacuous placeholders. It matches the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in dimension n.
- The theorem is stated for functions between Fin n → ℝ, which is Mathlib's standard model for ℝ^n.
- Hypotheses: `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)` and `hU : IsOpen U` (U is an open subset of ℝ^n). `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)` is a globally defined function, together with `hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U` (f is C^1 on U). `p : Fin n → ℝ` with `hp : p ∈ U`.
- Invertible derivative assumption: `h_deriv : ∃ (L : (Fin n → ℝ) ≃L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)), L.toContinuousLinearMap = fderivWithin ℝ f U p`. This says the (within-U) Fréchet derivative of f at p equals a continuous linear equivalence L, i.e., the derivative at p is invertible. Since U is open, `fderivWithin` coincides with the usual derivative at p.
- Conclusion: There exist open sets V, W in ℝ^n with `IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W ∧ p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ f '' V = W` and `Set.InjOn f V` (f restricted to V is injective). Moreover, there exists a global function `g : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)` such that on W, `f (g y) = y` for all `y ∈ W`, and on V, `g (f x) = x` for all `x ∈ V`, and `ContDiffOn ℝ 1 g W` (g is C^1 on W). From these properties and `f '' V = W`, one deduces that g maps W into V and is the inverse of f|_V: W → V.

Faithfulness check against the natural language statement:
- Domain/codomain: Fin n → ℝ faithfully represents ℝ^n. Using a global f with `ContDiffOn` on U instead of a function U → ℝ^n is a standard formalization and acceptable.
- U open, f C^1 on U, p ∈ U: matches perfectly.
- Invertible derivative at p: encoded via existence of a continuous linear equivalence equal to the derivative within U at p. Since U is open, this matches the usual Df|_p being invertible (det ≠ 0 in coordinates).
- Existence of open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, and injectivity of f on V: exactly present (`IsOpen V`, `IsOpen W`, `p ∈ V`, `V ⊆ U`, `f '' V = W`, `Set.InjOn f V`).
- Existence of g: The code gives a global g with two-sided inverse properties on V and W and C^1 regularity on W. This implies the intended g : W → V equals (f|_V)⁻¹. So this part matches.
- Missing piece: The natural statement includes the explicit formula for the derivative of the inverse, namely Dg|_y = (Df|_x)⁻¹ for all x ∈ V, y = f(x). The Lean statement explicitly says in a comment that it does not formalize this derivative equality and indeed does not include it in the theorem conclusion. This is a substantive part of the original statement and is omitted.

Final comparison:
- Everything up to and including existence, injectivity, and C^1 regularity of the local inverse is faithfully captured.
- The code omits the “furthermore” derivative formula Dg(y) = (Df(x))⁻¹. Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly weaker than the natural language statement.

Given that omission, the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's topology and analysis library.
- Docstring: States the intended meaning: for complex-valued f, convergence to L at infinity in the Riemann sphere sense is equivalent to the usual ε–M condition with |z| > M.
- The theorem `tendsto_at_infty_riemann_sphere_iff {f : ℂ → ℂ} {L : ℂ}` asserts an equivalence:
  Left side: `Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.cocompact (X := ℂ)) (nhds (L : ℂ))` means f tends to L along the cocompact filter on ℂ. The cocompact filter corresponds to approaching ∞ in the one-point compactification (the Riemann sphere viewpoint on the domain).
  Right side: `∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z > M → Complex.abs (f z - L) < ε` is exactly the ε–M definition: for every ε > 0 there exists M such that if |z| > M then |f(z) − L| < ε.
- `by sorry`: No proof is provided; only the statement matters for this audit.

2) Whole translation vs natural language:
The natural language statement says: For L ∈ ℂ, lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the Riemann sphere sense iff for every ε>0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M. The Lean LHS uses Tendsto along the cocompact filter on ℂ to the neighborhood filter at L in ℂ, which is the formalization of “limit as z→∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere (one-point compactification on the domain).” The RHS is the ε–M characterization. This matches exactly. L is explicitly typed as ℂ (finite), matching the hypothesis.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain approach: Using `Filter.cocompact` is the standard Lean encoding of approaching ∞ in the one-point compactification (Riemann sphere) of ℂ. This fits the phrase “in the sense of the Riemann sphere.”
- Codomain: Neighborhood filter `nhds L` in ℂ matches “L ∈ ℂ.”
- The ε–M side uses `>` (not ≥), consistent with the natural language. No extraneous or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement.
Therefore the translation is faithful.

- Context: U : Set Complex with hU : IsOpen U. This matches “Let U ⊂ C be open”.
- Claim: There exists K : ℕ → Set Complex such that:
  - (∀ n, IsCompact (K n)): each K_n is compact.
  - (∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1))): K_n is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.
  - U = ⋃ n, interior (K n): U is the union of the interiors of the K_n.
  - ∀ n, ∃ s : Finset (Complex × ℝ), K n ⊆ ⋃ p ∈ s, closedBall p.1 p.2 ∧ (⋃ p ∈ s, closedBall p.1 p.2) ⊆ interior (K (n+1)):

- Compactness: matches via ∀ n, IsCompact (K n).
- Nesting: matches via K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)).
- Exhaustion: matches via U = ⋃ n, interior (K n).
- Finite disk covers: matches via existence of Finset (Complex × ℝ) and unions of closedBall.
- Subset of U: Although not stated explicitly, from U = ⋃ n interior (K n) we have interior (K (n+1)) ⊆ U for each n, hence K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)) ⊆ U, so indeed each K_n ⊆ U as required. Thus the “subset of U” requirement is implied by the stated properties.
- Closed disks: closedBall in Complex with radius in ℝ is the standard closed disk; the code does not enforce r ≥ 0, but since it’s existential, one can choose nonnegative radii; allowing more general r does not harm faithfulness.
- Indexing: Lean indexes by ℕ starting at 0 instead of 1; this is a harmless reindexing.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No vacuous definitions; no placeholders. Conditions are standard Mathlib notions.
- All three structural conditions (compactness, nesting, exhaustion) are present and match the natural statement.
- The finite closed disk cover condition is present and matches.
- The “subset of U” condition is implied, as explained.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Right side: `∀ M : ℝ, M > 0 → ∃ δ : ℝ, δ > 0 ∧ ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs (z - z0) < δ → Complex.abs (f z) > M`
  means: for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with |z − z0| < δ, we have |f(z)| > M.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff ∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, |z − z0| < δ ⇒ |f(z)| > M.”
- The RHS of the Lean theorem matches the RHS of the natural language statement (they both use strict inequalities and do not exclude z = z0 in the condition |z − z0| < δ).
- The LHS intends to formalize “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere.” A standard equivalent formalization is: |f(z)| → ∞ as z → z0 (in the punctured sense). Using Lean filters, that is `Tendsto (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop` (the punctured neighborhood filter). The code instead uses `nhds z0` (unpunctured), which is strictly stronger: it forces the eventual bounds to hold also at z = z0.

Step 3: Are they the same?
- There is a critical discrepancy: the code uses `nhds z0` (unpunctured limit), whereas the standard notion of “lim_{z→z0} …” and especially the Riemann sphere limit should be taken along the punctured filter `𝓝[≠] z0` (excluding z0). Similarly, the epsilon–delta condition in the usual definition would be `0 < |z − z0| < δ`. The code’s (and the provided RHS text’s) omission of the `0 <` makes the condition strictly stronger and, in fact, impossible for an ℂ-valued f unless f(z0) itself is “infinite,” which cannot happen here. So the LHS as written in Lean is a strictly stronger and, in practice, untenable formalization for ℂ-valued functions.
- While the switch from “Riemann sphere limit to ∞” to “|f| → atTop” is conceptually fine, the use of the unpunctured filter breaks faithfulness to the intended mathematical statement. The RHS of the Lean theorem matches the text’s RHS but shares the same issue of not excluding z = z0.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation of the standard statement because it uses the unpunctured filter `nhds z0` instead of the punctured one `𝓝[≠] z0`. A faithful Lean statement would be
  Tendsto (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop ↔ ∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, 0 < |z − z0| ∧ |z − z0| < δ → |f z| > M.

Given this mismatch, the translation does not pass.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def RiemannIntegrableOn {X : Type*} (f : X → ℝ) (s : Set X) : Prop := True`
  This defines a predicate named RiemannIntegrableOn for a function f on a set s, but it is set to `True` for all inputs. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not capture any actual notion of Riemann integrability.

- `theorem riemann_integrable_of_continuous_on {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] {S : Set X} {f : X → ℝ} (hS : TotallyBounded S) (hf : ContinuousOn f S) : RiemannIntegrableOn f S := by sorry`
  This states: For a metric space X, a set S in X that is totally bounded, and a function f : X → ℝ that is continuous on S, then f is RiemannIntegrableOn on S. However, since RiemannIntegrableOn is defined as True, the conclusion is trivial and carries no mathematical content. The `sorry` means the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation checking, but the conclusion itself is meaningless due to the placeholder definition.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Let (X,d) be a metric space, S ⊂ X totally bounded, f : S → ℝ continuous. Prove that f is Riemann integrable.
- The Lean version uses f : X → ℝ with `ContinuousOn f S`, which is essentially the same as having a function defined on S (by restriction). That part is acceptable as a common formalization choice.
- The key issue: The code's notion of Riemann integrability is a placeholder `True`. This does not faithfully represent Riemann integrability. Hence, the theorem as stated in Lean is vacuously true and does not reflect the intended mathematical content.

Additional observations:
- Mathlib does not have a general Riemann integral on arbitrary totally bounded subsets of metric spaces; standard Riemann integrability is usually on intervals in ℝ (or boxes in ℝ^n). So introducing a new predicate is fine in principle, but it must be a faithful definition, not `True`.
- There are no other auxiliary definitions; the only auxiliary def is vacuous, triggering a failure under the guidelines.

Final check: The two problems are not the same. The Lean code asserts a trivial truth because of a vacuous definition, whereas the natural language statement asserts a substantive integrability claim. If the placeholder were replaced by a correct definition of Riemann integrability on S, the statement would match the natural language closely. Therefore this earns a mid-level score per the rubric for vacuous definitions with otherwise faithful structure.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Context: U ⊆ ℂ is a set with hU : IsOpen U (U is open) and hUconn : IsConnected U (U is connected). f : ℂ → ℂ is a complex-valued function, assumed to be complex differentiable on U: hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (holomorphic on U). Nonconstancy is expressed as h_nonconst : ∃ x y, x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ U ∧ f x ≠ f y (so f is not constant on U). We pick a point p ∈ U via hp : p ∈ U.
- Statement: There exists δ > 0 such that the function z ↦ f z, when viewed with domain the punctured open ball { z : ℂ // z ∈ ball p δ \ {p} }, is an open map (IsOpenMap).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and connected, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant, and p ∈ U, then there exists δ > 0 such that f restricted to Δ_δ(p) \ {p} is an open map.
- The code matches the hypotheses: U open and connected; f holomorphic on U (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U); f nonconstant on U; p ∈ U.
- The conclusion also matches in spirit: existence of δ > 0 so that the restriction of f to the punctured δ-ball around p is an open map. The code formalizes the restriction by making the domain a subtype {z : ℂ // z ∈ ball p δ \ {p}} and using IsOpenMap on that function.

Step 3: Check for discrepancies.
- The main stylistic difference is that the code takes f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, rather than f : U → ℂ, which is a standard Mathlib pattern.
- The only substantive omission is that the statement does not explicitly assert ball p δ ⊆ U (or equivalently, does not intersect the punctured ball with U in the domain). However, since U is open and p ∈ U, one can always choose δ small enough with ball p δ ⊆ U; thus, the existential δ can be chosen so that the domain considered in the code is in fact contained in U, making the two statements effectively equivalent. The code’s domain could have been {z | z ∈ ball p δ \ {p} ∧ z ∈ U} or could have added the side condition ball p δ ⊆ U, but this is a minor formalization choice and does not change the essence of the statement.
- All auxiliary components are legitimate Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsConnected, DifferentiableOn, IsOpenMap). No vacuous placeholders are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an essentially faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only a minor omission of an explicit inclusion ball p δ ⊆ U that is implicitly available and can be ensured by the choice of δ.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- Docstring: States the intended theorem: if (a_n) is absolutely summable and (b_n) is summable (over ℝ), then the Cauchy product c_n is summable.
- Theorem statement:
  - Context: `a b : ℕ → ℝ` are real sequences.
  - Hypotheses: `ha : Summable (fun n => abs (a n))` meaning the series of |a_n| converges (absolute convergence of a), and `hb : Summable b` meaning the series ∑ b_n converges (not necessarily absolutely).
  - Conclusion: `Summable (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k))`. This defines the Cauchy product terms c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} (the use of `Finset.range (n+1)` ensures k ≤ n, so `n - k` is the usual difference), and asserts that the series ∑ c_n converges (Summable), not that it is absolutely summable.
  - `by sorry`: No proof, but this is acceptable for the stated auditing task.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show the Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely.”
- The Lean theorem proves only that the Cauchy product converges (Summable), not that it converges absolutely. This corresponds to Mertens’ theorem (absolute convergence of one factor implies the Cauchy product converges), whereas the NL statement asks for absolute convergence of the product, which generally requires both series to converge absolutely.
- So the conclusion in Lean is strictly weaker than the natural language claim and does not include absolute convergence of the product.

3) Final comparison:
- Assumptions: match up to a small specialization to ℝ (acceptable).
- Conclusion: Lean says “convergent,” NL says “absolutely convergent.” These are different statements; the Lean code does not faithfully capture the NL statement.
- No vacuous/placeholder definitions; the single theorem statement is legitimate.

Given the substantial difference in the conclusion (absolute vs mere convergence), the translation is not faithful.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing by ℕ corresponds to a sequence. Using IsOpen and Dense from Mathlib is standard. The completeness assumption is present. The conclusion is exactly density of the intersection. No extra hypotheses or omissions. The use of `sorry` is only in the proof, not in definitions, and the task is about the statement/translation. No auxiliary vacuous definitions.

However, both Bounded and IsJordanMeasurable are defined as True, so the statement is trivially true; furthermore, the proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: “Prove that every bounded convex set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable.” The Lean theorem’s shape matches this sentence: given boundedness and convexity, conclude Jordan measurability for sets in ℝ^n. However, the code replaces both key notions (boundedness, Jordan measurability) with vacuous placeholders equal to True. This does not faithfully capture the intended mathematical meaning. Additionally, the proof is a `sorry`, but that is acceptable for auditing the statement; the real issue is the vacuous auxiliary definitions.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The original claim is a substantive statement about genuine boundedness and Jordan measurability in ℝ^n. The Lean code trivializes both predicates, making the theorem vacuously true. Also, it does not use Mathlib’s actual Bounded (from metric spaces) nor any accepted formalization of Jordan measurability. Representing ℝ^n as Fin n → ℝ is fine, and using Convex ℝ s from Mathlib is legitimate, but the crucial notions are placeholders. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Given that, while the high-level shape matches and would be faithful if the placeholders were replaced by proper definitions, the presence of vacuous definitions means it fails under the guidelines. This corresponds to a score where fixing the placeholders would make it faithful.

- `theorem det_permutation_matrix_eq_one_or_neg_one {n : Type} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n] {R : Type} [CommRing R] (σ : Equiv.Perm n) :` sets up a finite index type `n` for rows/columns (so we have an n×n matrix), with decidable equality, and a commutative ring `R` as the coefficient ring. It quantifies over a permutation `σ` on `n`.
- `Matrix.det (fun i j => if j = σ i then (1 : R) else 0)` defines the determinant of the matrix whose entries are 1 exactly when the column index `j` equals `σ i` for the row index `i`, and 0 otherwise. This is precisely a permutation matrix (specifically, the matrix of the permutation σ acting by permuting columns).
- The conclusion `= 1 ∨ ... = -1` states that the determinant of this permutation matrix is either 1 or −1 in the ring `R`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Let P be a permutation matrix. Prove that det(P) ∈ {−1, 1}.” The Lean statement handles exactly the matrices that are permutation matrices (given by some σ) and asserts their determinant is either 1 or −1. This matches the content.
- Using an arbitrary commutative ring `R` is a slight generalization (often the statement is given over ℝ or ℂ), but the result is still true (determinant equals the sign of σ, which is ±1 in any commutative ring), and such a generalization is acceptable.
- The encoding of a permutation matrix via `if j = σ i then 1 else 0` is one standard convention (permuting columns). Any permutation matrix is of this form for some permutation σ. Thus the Lean statement ranges over all permutation matrices.
- Expressing “det(P) ∈ {−1,1}” as the disjunction `det = 1 ∨ det = -1` is logically equivalent.
- The instruction “without Laplace formula” concerns the proof method; since the Lean snippet only states the theorem (with `sorry`), we only assess the statement, not the proof strategy.

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct and standard.
- The Lean theorem is a faithful (slightly generalized) formalization of the natural language statement. There are no substantive differences in mathematical meaning.

The code replaces “holomorphic on a neighborhood” by the existence of a power series representation f(z) = ∑ a(n) z^n for all |z| ≤ 1. Under the original assumption, the Taylor series at 0 converges on some disk of radius R > 1 and equals f on |z| ≤ 1, so the code’s assumption is a faithful way to encode the analyticity needed for the conclusion.
- The original conclusion uses the Taylor coefficients f^{(k)}(0)/k!; the code uses the coefficients a(k). Uniqueness of power series around 0 implies a(k) = f^{(k)}(0)/k! when the series equals f near 0 (which it does here), so the expressions match.
- The inequality and its quantifiers (exists C, for all m ∈ ℕ and |z| ≤ 1) match exactly, up to the reparametrization by a(k).

3) Final check for differences:
- The code assumes explicit series equality on the closed unit disk rather than stating holomorphy on a neighborhood of the closed disk. The latter implies the former (via the Taylor series with radius > 1), so this is a faithful reformulation for the purpose of the stated bound.
- The separate hypothesis h_a0 is redundant but consistent.
- No vacuous placeholders or made-up definitions are used; only standard Mathlib notions appear.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If `f : [a,b] → ℝ` is bounded and uniformly continuous, then `f` is Riemann integrable.
- The Lean code tries to mirror the hypotheses correctly (boundedness and uniform continuity on `[a,b]`). However, the conclusion uses a placeholder predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` defined as `True`, which does not encode Riemann integrability. Thus the formal statement is vacuous and not faithful to the intended mathematical meaning.

Final check:
- The two problems are different. The Lean conclusion asserts a trivially true proposition due to a vacuous definition, whereas the natural language statement asserts genuine Riemann integrability. This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders. There is also no use of Mathlib's actual Riemann integrability notion (Mathlib primarily formalizes Lebesgue integrability; if one wanted Riemann, one should use the appropriate Mathlib constructions rather than `True`).

Grade justification:
- Since a vacuous definition is used, the translation fails. If the placeholder were replaced with a legitimate integrability predicate and the theorem stated with that predicate, the structure of the statement would be faithful. According to the rubric, this corresponds to a 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open scoped BigOperators` bring in Mathlib and the notation for infinite sums `∑'` and finite sums over finsets.
- The theorem `summable_cauchy_product` is stated for a general normed field `α` and sequences `a b : ℕ → α`.
- Hypotheses: `ha : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)` and `hb : Summable (fun n => ‖b n‖)` say the series of norms of `a` and `b` converge, i.e., both series are absolutely convergent.
- Conclusion, first part: `Summable (fun n => ‖Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))‖)` asserts that the series formed by the norms of the Cauchy product terms is summable; that is, the Cauchy product series is absolutely convergent. Here the n-th term of the Cauchy product is defined as `∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}` via `Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1))`.
- Conclusion, second part: `(∑' n, Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))) = (∑' n, a n) * (∑' n, b n)` states that the sum of the Cauchy product equals the product of the sums of the original series.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing translation; no placeholder definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is absolutely convergent, and its sum equals the product of the sums.”
- The Lean theorem exactly assumes absolute convergence of the two series (via summability of the norms), concludes absolute convergence of their Cauchy product (via summability of the norms of the Cauchy product terms), and asserts the identity of the sum with the product of sums. The Cauchy product is expressed in the standard way `∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}`.
- The result is stated over a general `NormedField α`, which is a mild generalization (typically the statement is over ℝ or ℂ), and is acceptable.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The mathematical content matches precisely: same hypotheses (absolute convergence), same conclusions (absolute convergence of Cauchy product and equality of sums). The indexing and definition of the Cauchy product are standard and correct.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- The only difference is the generality of `α` being any normed field, which is a standard acceptable generalization.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and opens: Using Mathlib with Complex and Finset namespaces; no issue.
- The theorem statement `jirilebl_ca_ca_12552` takes `f : ℂ → ℂ` and hypotheses:
  • `h : ∃ U : Set ℂ, IsOpen U ∧ closedBall (0 : ℂ) 1 ⊆ U ∧ AnalyticOn ℂ f U` means: there exists an open set U containing the closed unit disk such that f is analytic (holomorphic) on U. This matches “holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed disk \overline{D}(0,1)”.
  • `hf0 : f 0 ≠ 0` matches f(0) ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: `∃ C : ℝ, ∀ m : ℕ, ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z ≤ 1 → ...` means: there exists a real constant C such that for all natural m and all complex z with |z| ≤ 1, the inequality holds.
- The inequality: `Complex.abs (1 - Finset.sum (Finset.range (m + 1)) fun k => (((iteratedDeriv k f 0) / (↑(Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) / f 0) * z ^ k) ≤ C * (Complex.abs z) ^ (m + 1)` translates to
  |1 − Σ_{k=0}^m ( (f^{(k)}(0)/k!) / f(0) ) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.
  Here `iteratedDeriv k f 0` is the k-th complex derivative at 0, `Nat.factorial k` is k!, the division by `f 0` gives the factor 1/f(0), and `Finset.range (m+1)` sums k = 0..m. This matches the summand f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0)) z^k.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
- Hypotheses: “holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk” and “f(0) ≠ 0” are captured exactly by the existence of an open U with closedBall(0,1) ⊆ U and AnalyticOn f U, and f 0 ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: Existence of a constant C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and |z| ≤ 1, the specified inequality holds. The Lean statement uses Complex.abs for modulus, natural-number exponents, and sums over k = 0..m, exactly as in the natural statement.
- Minor technicality: C is not explicitly constrained to be nonnegative, but the natural statement also just says “there exists a constant C,” so this is acceptable.

3) Final check: The two statements are the same. The Lean code faithfully formalizes the natural language theorem with the standard Mathlib notions (AnalyticOn, iteratedDeriv, factorial, etc.), no vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced, and the summation, bounds, and domain are all correct.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient space is (Fin n → ℝ), i.e., ℝ^n, and f : ℝ^n → ℝ.
- U, K ⊆ ℝ^n are sets. Hypotheses:
  - hU : Convex ℝ U — U is convex.
  - hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U — f is C^2 on the set U (in the sense of derivatives on a set), hence in particular its Hessian (second derivative) is continuous on U.
  - hK : IsCompact K — K is compact.
  - hKsub : K ⊆ U — K is contained in U.
- Conclusion: For every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x, y ∈ K with ‖y − x‖ ≤ δ,
  | f y − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) (y − x) − (1/2) * (iteratedFDeriv ℝ 2 f x) (fun _ => y − x) | ≤ ε * ‖y − x‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the (global) Fréchet derivative of f at x, and iteratedFDeriv ℝ 2 f x is the second Fréchet derivative (a bilinear map), evaluated at (y − x, y − x) via (fun _ => y − x). This is precisely the second-order Taylor polynomial at x with a remainder of order o(‖y − x‖^2), stated uniformly over x, y in the compact set K.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 with Hessian continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The code mirrors this: it assumes f is C^2 on U (ContDiffOn ℝ 2), U is convex, picks any compact K ⊆ U, and states the uniform second-order remainder estimate on K.
- The norm-squared scaling (ε * ‖y − x‖^2) is the usual uniform second-order remainder form, and the second derivative is evaluated at x with the symmetric bilinear form applied to (y − x, y − x) and multiplied by 1/2 — this matches the classical second-order Taylor polynomial at x.

3) Differences and possible issues:
- y ∈ K (not merely in U): The code requires both x and y lie in the compact set K, whereas many formulations of “uniform on compact subsets” quantify uniformly over x ∈ K and y ∈ U sufficiently close to x (not necessarily y ∈ K). This is a slight specialization. It still expresses a uniform statement on the compact subset K and is a standard acceptable strengthening/restriction of the usual uniformity, so this is a mild discrepancy.
- Use of global derivatives (fderiv, iteratedFDeriv) vs derivatives on a set (fderivWithin): The assumption is ContDiffOn on U (which need not be open in the statement), but the Taylor polynomial uses the global derivative at x. Typically, one either assumes U is open (so ContDiffOn reduces to usual ContDiff) or uses the within-derivative. The natural statement’s wording is a bit informal and usually understood with U open; the code does not assume U is open but still uses global derivatives. This is a technical mismatch: the hypotheses do not guarantee global differentiability at x from outside U. However, since f is defined on all of ℝ^n and the intended analytic statement is the classical one (usually with U open), this is a minor formalization nuance rather than a substantive change in meaning.
- The convexity of U is assumed but not explicitly used in the statement itself; it aligns with the natural language assumption and is harmless.

Overall, the code is a faithful formalization of the intended theorem up to standard formalization choices and a slight specialization (requiring y ∈ K). No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions are present; all terms are from Mathlib.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement says the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^k does not converge uniformly on (−1,1). Uniform convergence of a series is defined via uniform convergence of its sequence of partial sums to the pointwise limit. The theorem is precisely the negation of the uniform convergence definition for the partial sums s n to the function limit on the domain (−1,1). Thus it faithfully encodes the claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: both use (−1,1) (Lean’s `Ioo (-1) 1`).
- Objects: real-valued series in x, consistent with ℝ used in the code.
- Statement: explicit negation of the uniform convergence condition matches “does not converge uniformly.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `s` and `limit` are genuine definitions.
There are no discrepancies affecting meaning. The presence of `sorry` is about the proof, not the statement, and the task concerns faithful translation of the statement.

The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is clear: it negates uniform convergence on Ioo (-1, 1).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
The original statement: For any 0 ≤ c < 1, the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on the closed interval [-c, c]. Formally, this would be: ∀ c, 0 ≤ c < 1 → ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x ∈ Icc (-c) c, |s n x - limit x| < ε.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code asserts a negative statement (non-uniform convergence) on the larger open interval (-1, 1), i.e., ¬(uniform on Ioo (-1,1)).
- The natural language asks for a positive uniform convergence result on each compact interval [-c, c] with c < 1.
- Domains differ: Ioo (-1,1) vs Icc (-c, c) for arbitrary c < 1.
- Directions differ: code denies uniform convergence on (-1,1), while the original claims uniform convergence on every smaller closed subinterval [-c, c].
- Auxiliary definitions `s` and `limit` are legitimate and meaningful; no vacuous placeholders. However, the main theorem does not express the requested statement.

  • f ∘ g = id on V (i.e., ∀ w ∈ V, f (g w) = w),
  • and g is complex differentiable at f z0 (DifferentiableAt ℂ g (f z0)).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: Suppose f is analytic and f'(z0) ≠ 0. Show that f is a local diffeomorphism at z0, i.e., locally invertible with analytic inverse.
- Mismatches in hypotheses: The Lean code assumes only DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0, not that f is analytic (holomorphic) in a neighborhood of z0. Analyticity is a stronger, local condition (holomorphic on a neighborhood) than differentiability at a single point.
- Mismatches in conclusions: The Lean code concludes existence of a two-sided inverse between open sets (so a local inverse) and only asserts differentiability of g at a single point (f z0). The natural statement requires the inverse to be analytic (holomorphic) on a neighborhood (i.e., at least DifferentiableOn/AnalyticOn on V, or AnalyticAt at all points of V), not merely differentiable at one point.
- Further regularity gaps: The code does not assert f is differentiable (or analytic) on U, nor that g is differentiable on all of V or analytic. Thus it falls short of “local diffeomorphism with analytic inverse.” It encodes a local two-sided inverse, but with only pointwise differentiability of the inverse.

3) Final check — same or different?
- Different. The code both weakens the hypothesis (DifferentiableAt at a point vs. analytic in a neighborhood) and weakens the conclusion (inverse only DifferentiableAt at one point vs. analytic on a neighborhood). It also omits regularity statements that would justify calling it a local diffeomorphism in the analytic sense. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib’s standard analysis library.
- The docstring explains the intended meaning: If a real series ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent (i.e., summable but not absolutely summable), then for every ε > 0 the weighted series ∑ (n+1)^ε · |a_{n+1}| is not summable; the `n+1` shift is to avoid issues with 0^ε and to match indexing from 1.
- `theorem conditional_series_not_fast_enough (a : ℕ → ℝ) (h_sum : Summable a) (h_not_abs : ¬ Summable fun n => abs (a n)) : ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ¬ Summable fun n => (((n + 1 : ℕ) : ℝ) ^ ε) * abs (a (n + 1)) := by sorry`
  • Here, `a : ℕ → ℝ` is the sequence of real terms.
  • `h_sum : Summable a` asserts that the (unshifted) series ∑_{n=0}^∞ a(n) converges.
  • `h_not_abs : ¬ Summable (fun n => abs (a n))` asserts the absolute series ∑_{n=0}^∞ |a(n)| diverges. Together these encode conditional convergence.
  • Conclusion: for every real ε with 0 < ε, the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ ((n+1)^ε)·|a(n+1)| diverges (is not summable). The indexing via `n+1` simply reindexes to start effectively at 1 and avoids 0^ε.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language says: if ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent, then the terms do not tend to zero “fast enough” to ensure absolute convergence. A standard precise formalization of this idea is: for any ε > 0, the series ∑ n^ε |a_n| diverges. This is stricter than merely saying n^ε a_n does not tend to 0, and indeed implies that no polynomially faster decay of |a_n| can make the absolute series converge. The Lean statement exactly asserts this divergence (with a harmless index shift), given conditional convergence. It uses real-valued sequences, which is a standard and acceptable specialization.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is a direct formalization.
- The only technical deviation is indexing: Lean sums over ℕ starting at 0, and the conclusion uses `n+1` to emulate starting at 1. This is mathematically equivalent and faithful.
- The statement is a precise and standard strengthening of the informal phrase “not fast enough.” It correctly captures that any positive power weight would force absolute convergence, hence if the absolute sum diverges, the weighted series cannot converge. Thus the translation is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: Let X be a type with a metric space structure and assume X is compact (in the sense of every open cover has a finite subcover, encoded by `[CompactSpace X]`). For any sequence `u : ℕ → X`, there exists a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` (a subsequence selector) and a point `x ∈ X` such that the subsequence `u ∘ φ` converges to `x` (formalized as `Filter.Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)`).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language assumption ""every open cover of X has a finite subcover"" is exactly the compactness assumption encoded by `[CompactSpace X]` in Mathlib.
- The conclusion ""every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence"" is formalized by the existence of a strictly monotone `φ` and `x : X` such that `u ∘ φ` tends to `x` in the neighborhood filter `nhds x`. In a metric space, this is precisely convergence as ordinarily understood.

- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The use of filters is a standard faithful formalization of convergence.
- Restriction to metric spaces matches the natural language. The compactness assumption is encoded appropriately. No weakening/strengthening beyond the intended statement.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [CompleteSpace E]`
  Interprets E as a complete normed abelian group. This generalizes the usual real/complex setting and is standard for absolute convergence arguments.

- The theorem `summable_of_grouping_of_abs_summable` states: Given a sequence `a : ℕ → E` and an index map `N : ℕ → ℕ`, if
  (1) `h_abs : Summable fun n => ‖a n‖` (the series of norms converges, i.e., absolute convergence),

  (4) `hN_unbounded : ∀ m, ∃ k, N k ≥ m` (N tends to infinity, so all terms are eventually included),
  then the series obtained by grouping consecutive terms into blocks `[N k, N (k+1))`, namely `fun k => ∑ i in Finset.range (N (k+1) - N k), a (N k + i)`, is summable and its sum equals the original sum `tsum a`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural statement: If ∑ a_n is absolutely convergent, then any series obtained by grouping terms converges and has the same sum.
- The Lean statement exactly captures grouping by a strictly increasing, unbounded N with N 0 = 0, forming blocks of consecutive terms. This is the standard formalization of grouping.
- It asserts both convergence (Summable of the grouped series) and equality of sums (tsum of grouped series equals tsum a).
- The index starts at 0 in Lean, while the natural statement starts at 1; this is a harmless convention difference.
- The generality to any complete normed abelian group E is a benign (and standard) generalization. No vacuous definitions are used; there are no auxiliary fake placeholders.

Final comparison:
- The mathematical content matches the original statement faithfully: absolute convergence implies that any grouping into consecutive finite blocks yields a convergent series with the same sum.

Thus, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- Docstring: States the intended mathematical content: if f : ℂ → ℂ is complex-differentiable and injective, then its inverse on the image is differentiable; this expresses that f is conformal onto its image.
- `theorem injective_differentiable_conformal (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf : Differentiable ℂ f) (hfi : Function.Injective f) : DifferentiableOn ℂ (Function.invFun f) (Set.range f) := by sorry`
  • Hypotheses: `hf : Differentiable ℂ f` means f is holomorphic (complex differentiable) everywhere on ℂ (entire). `hfi : Function.Injective f` means f is injective.
  • Conclusion: `DifferentiableOn ℂ (Function.invFun f) (Set.range f)` says that the inverse function, defined via `Function.invFun f` (a choice of a preimage where it exists), is complex-differentiable at every point of the set `Set.range f` (the image of f). This is precisely expressing that the inverse function is holomorphic on the image of f.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f: ℂ → ℂ is analytic (holomorphic) and injective, then f is a conformal mapping onto its image, i.e., a holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse onto its image.
- The code assumes f is holomorphic (`Differentiable ℂ f`) and injective, and concludes that the inverse on the image is holomorphic (`DifferentiableOn ℂ (Function.invFun f) (Set.range f)`). Since injectivity implies bijection onto its image, together these provide exactly “holomorphic bijection with holomorphic inverse onto its image.” The docstring also clarifies that this is the intended interpretation.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is stated directly and cleanly.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The only slight formalization choice is using `Function.invFun f` restricted to `Set.range f` to represent the inverse. This is standard and correct: on the image of f, `invFun f` coincides (by choice) with an inverse of f. `DifferentiableOn` on `Set.range f` is exactly “the inverse is holomorphic on the image.”
- The natural language uses “analytic”; Lean uses `Differentiable ℂ`, which matches holomorphicity. The domain is ℂ in both. The requirement of bijectivity onto the image is satisfied by injectivity. The statement does not explicitly mention openness of the image, which is not necessary to state the holomorphicity of the inverse in this formalization.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Faithful, no red flags, no vacuous constructs, and the formalization captures the intended theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: Fix a natural number n (dimension).
- `variable (m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Introduce an arbitrary function m_star from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as `Fin n → ℝ`) to ℝ. No properties (like being an outer measure) are assumed.
- The docstring claims: Let m_star be the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles. Then for any sets A,B, subadditivity holds.
- `theorem outer_measure_via_rectangles_subadd (A B : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : m_star (A ∪ B) ≤ m_star A + m_star B := by sorry`: States that for any sets A,B, the inequality holds for the arbitrary function m_star, with no hypotheses. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language assumes m^* is a specific outer measure (constructed via countable covers by open rectangles). Subadditivity is a defining property of outer measures.
- The code does not encode that m_star is an outer measure, nor that it is defined via rectangles; it is merely an arbitrary set function. Thus the theorem claims a universally false statement (subadditivity for any function).
- Hence the key structural hypothesis is missing, making the translation unfaithful. The docstring describes the intended meaning, but the formal statement does not reflect it.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Same part: The inequality `m^*(A ∪ B) ≤ m^*(A) + m^*(B)` and the ambient space ℝ^n (modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`).
- Differences: The code lacks the crucial assumption that m_star is an outer measure (let alone the specific one built from open rectangles). Therefore it vastly overgeneralizes to an arbitrary function, which is not faithful. Additionally, the presence of `sorry` is acceptable under the ""no proofs"" instruction, but the missing structural assumptions make the statement itself incorrect.

If fixed by replacing `m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with `μ : OuterMeasure (Fin n → ℝ)` (or by defining m_star as that specific outer measure), the statement would be a faithful (even slightly more general) formalization.

The Lean statement assumes A is a linear map and takes as hypotheses an explicit C ≥ 0 satisfying the bound, and concludes continuity. This exactly captures the notion of “bounded implies continuous” for linear maps.
- The Lean setup corresponds to normed vector spaces over a normed field, matching the intended context. Using ℝ for C is standard since norms are ℝ-valued.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean theorem states: for any C ≥ 0 satisfying the inequality, A is continuous. The natural statement uses an existential: if there exists such C. The Lean version is a standard strengthening that still faithfully represents the original claim; one can apply the Lean theorem using a chosen witness C from the existential. No mismatch in meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions. The presence of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable per the task, since we are auditing the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language and assess it.
- Universe and structures: E is a real normed vector space that is finite-dimensional (so this models ℝ^n). f : E → ℝ.
- U, K : Set E with hypotheses:
  - hU : Convex ℝ U (U is convex),
  - hK : IsCompact K (K is compact),
  - hsub : K ⊆ U (K is a subset of U),
  - hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (f is C^2 on U, i.e., has continuous derivatives up to order 2 on U).
- Conclusion: For every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ ≤ δ and x + h ∈ U, we have the second-order Taylor error estimate
  | f(x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here:
  - fderiv ℝ f x : E →L[ℝ] ℝ is the Fréchet derivative at x (the gradient as a linear functional), applied to h for the linear term.
  - fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x : E →L[ℝ] (E →L[ℝ] ℝ) is the second derivative at x; applied to h it yields a linear functional E →L[ℝ] ℝ, which is then applied to h again, giving the bilinear evaluation D^2 f(x)(h, h). The factor (1/2) is present as in the standard second-order Taylor polynomial.
  - The ascription (… : E → ℝ) uses the coercion from continuous linear maps to functions, which is standard in Mathlib; so the types line up.
- The guard x + h ∈ U, together with x ∈ K ⊆ U and convexity of U, ensures the relevant segment stays in U, which is what is usually needed for Taylor's theorem on sets.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ of class C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U, show the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- Lean statement: For E finite-dimensional real normed vector space (ℝ^n), U convex, K compact subset of U, and f ∈ C^2 on U, the second-order Taylor approximation has a uniform remainder bound on K: ∀ ε > 0 ∃ δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ ≤ δ and x + h ∈ U, |remainder| ≤ ε‖h‖^2.
- This exactly captures “uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets of U.” The use of ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U is an appropriate formalization of f being C^2 with continuous second derivative (Hessian) on U. The finite-dimensional assumption matches ℝ^n. The quantifiers and inequality are the standard uniform little-o(‖h‖^2) formulation.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all are standard Mathlib notions.
- The structure allows any finite-dimensional E rather than explicitly ℝ^n, which is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- The statement quantifies uniformly over compact K ⊆ U and uses the correct second-order term with 1/2 and the bilinear second derivative applied to (h, h).
- The condition x + h ∈ U together with convex U and x ∈ U is the right geometric constraint for Taylor on U; this matches the spirit of the natural statement.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Complex; noncomputable section: standard setup, working over Complex numbers.
- def f (z : Complex) : Complex := 1 / (z ^ 2 + 1) ^ 2
  This defines the complex function f(z) = 1/(z^2 + 1)^2.
- def a (n : ℕ) : Complex := if n % 2 = 0 then (-1 : Complex) ^ (n / 2) * (Complex.ofReal (n / 2 + 1)) else 0
  This defines the coefficients a_n of a power series by: a_n = 0 if n is odd, and if n is even (n = 2m), then a_n = (-1)^m (m+1). This matches the expected coefficients of the Taylor series of 1/(1+z^2)^2 at 0.
- theorem power_series_at_zero (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : f z = ∑' n : ℕ, a n * z ^ n := by sorry
  Intended statement: For |z| < 1, f(z) equals the power series with coefficients a_n. However, it uses sorry (an admitted proof), which is a red flag per the guidelines. Still, the statement itself is the correct series expansion radius-at-least-1 claim.
- theorem coefficients_spec (n : ℕ) : a (2 * n) = (-1 : Complex) ^ n * (n + 1) ∧ a (2 * n + 1) = 0 := by sorry
  Restates the even/odd formula for coefficients. Again, uses sorry, but the statement is consistent with the intended coefficients.
- theorem radius_of_convergence : True := by trivial
  This is vacuous. It does not state that the radius of convergence is 1; it only proves True. The accompanying comment says “Radius of convergence is 1,” but the theorem does not encode that fact at all. This is a clear mismatch.

Comparing to the natural language statement:
- Target statement: For f(x) = 1/(x^2+1)^2, show f is analytic, find its power series at 0, and its radius of convergence.
- Differences and issues:
  1) Domain: The Lean code works over Complex, not explicitly over the reals. This is a harmless generalization and acceptable.
  2) Analyticity: The code does not state that f is analytic (holomorphic) in any domain or at 0. There is no theorem asserting analyticity. The series equality for |z|<1 would imply holomorphy there, but this implication is not stated.
  3) Power series: The code defines the coefficients matching the correct Taylor series and states the equality for |z|<1, but leaves the proof as sorry. The statement itself is fine, but per the auditing guidelines, the presence of sorry marks it as a vacuous placeholder.
  4) Radius of convergence: The code fails to state the radius equals 1; instead it has a vacuous theorem proving True. This is not a faithful translation of the requested “find the radius of convergence.”

Final check:
- The formal content does not faithfully encode “f is analytic,” and it does not state “radius = 1.” The series statement is present but unproven (sorry) and thus considered vacuous under the guidelines. Therefore, overall the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- There is a reasonable attempt to encode the correct series and coefficients, but key parts are missing or vacuous (analyticity not stated; radius theorem is vacuous; proofs are replaced by sorry). If those were fixed (replace sorry and state radius=1 and analyticity), it would be faithful. Hence a middling score.

- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib, which provides `Summable` and absolute value on ℝ.
- `def ConditionallyConvergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`: Define a real sequence `a` to be conditionally convergent exactly when the series ∑ a_n converges but the series ∑ |a_n| does not converge (i.e., is not summable).
- `theorem convergent_not_absolutely_convergent_conditional {a : ℕ → ℝ} : Summable a → ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|) → ConditionallyConvergent a := by ...`: States and proves that if `a` is summable and its absolute value sequence is not summable, then `a` is conditionally convergent. The proof introduces the hypotheses and forms the conjunction, matching the definition.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent.
- The Lean theorem asserts: Summable a and not Summable |a| implies ConditionallyConvergent a, where ConditionallyConvergent is defined as “summable but not absolutely summable.” This matches exactly.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- Domain/codomain: The code uses sequences `a : ℕ → ℝ`. The natural language does not specify the field; ℝ is a standard setting and is a mild specialization (acceptable).
- Indexing: Mathlib’s `Summable` is over ℕ (starting at 0). The statement uses ∑ from 1 to ∞. Summability is invariant under finite shifts, so this is a harmless technical difference.
- Divergence: The statement’s “diverges” is captured by `¬ Summable` in Lean, which is standard.
- No placeholders or vacuous definitions; no auxiliary dubious constructs; proof is a direct packaging of the hypotheses into the definition.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given statement, with only benign, standard formalization choices.

- Conclusion `IsCompact (univ : Set X)`: The whole space X is compact, i.e., every open cover of X has a finite subcover.
- `by sorry`: No proof provided; does not affect the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: Let X be a metric space such that every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence. Prove that every open cover of X has a finite subcover. In Lean, this is exactly the assumption `hseq` and the conclusion `IsCompact univ`. In topology in Mathlib, `IsCompact (univ : Set X)` is equivalent to “every open cover of X has a finite subcover.” The convergence is to a point `a : X`, matching the usual meaning of a convergent subsequence in the space, not in some completion.

- Scope of X: metric space in both.
- Sequential compactness: identical formalization (exists subsequence strictly increasing and converging to a point in X).
- Compactness: expressed as `IsCompact univ`, which is exactly the open cover characterization.

  This defines the axis-aligned closed rectangle [a, b] in ℝ^n (represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`) via coordinate-wise inequalities. This is a faithful formalization of a closed rectangle.
- `def volume (n : ℕ) (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := ∏ i, (b i - a i)`
  This defines the usual geometric volume of the rectangle as the product of side lengths. This is faithful.
- `theorem outer_measure_closed_rectangle (n : ℕ) (m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (a b : Fin n → ℝ) (hab : ∀ i, a i ≤ b i) : m_star (rectangle n a b) = volume n a b := by sorry`
  This states: for any function `m_star` from sets of ℝ^n to ℝ, for any `a, b` with `a ≤ b` coordinatewise, we have `m_star([a,b]) = ∏ (b_i - a_i)`. There are no assumptions that `m_star` is the outer measure on ℝ^n, nor any properties like subadditivity, countable coverings by open rectangles, etc. Thus, `m_star` is a completely arbitrary function, making the theorem statement unrelated to the intended measure-theoretic content.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Let m^* denote the (specific) outer measure on ℝ^n defined via countable coverings by open rectangles. Show that for any closed rectangle R, m^*(R) = V(R).
- The code’s theorem replaces the specific outer measure `m^*` with an arbitrary function `m_star : Set → ℝ` without any axioms or definition. This is a critical discrepancy: the core concept (outer measure via coverings) is not encoded at all.
- The auxiliary definitions for rectangle and volume are faithful, but the main theorem’s hypothesis is missing the necessary structure and properties for `m_star`. Also, the codomain is `ℝ` (not `ℝ≥0∞`), which could be acceptable in this specific case since the volume is finite for finite `a, b`, but the lack of outer measure properties remains the key issue.

Final check:
- The math problems are different. The code asserts an equality for any arbitrary set-function `m_star`, which is not the same as asserting it for the outer measure. The definition of outer measure via coverings is absent. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- While the rectangle and volume definitions are legitimate and faithful, the central concept (outer measure) is replaced by a vacuous placeholder (an arbitrary function). According to the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful.” Thus a mid-level score is appropriate.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context and objects:
  - a, b : ℝ are real numbers; Icc a b denotes the closed interval [a, b].
  - U : Set ℂ, with hU : IsOpen U (U is an open subset of ℂ).
  - f : ℂ → ℂ is a complex-valued function defined on all of ℂ, together with hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (i.e., f is holomorphic on U).
  - α : ℝ → ℂ is a curve, with hα : DifferentiableOn ℝ α (Icc a b) (α is C¹ on [a, b]).
  - hα_range : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, α t ∈ U ensures α maps [a, b] into U.
  - hα'_nonzero : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, deriv α t ≠ 0 requires α′(t) ≠ 0 for all t ∈ [a, b]. Here deriv is the real derivative of α.
  - hderiv_nonzero : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, deriv f (α t) ≠ 0 requires the complex derivative of f at α(t) to be nonzero for all t ∈ [a, b]. Here deriv is the complex one-variable derivative because the domain is ℂ.

- Statement:
  - Left-hand side: (StrictMonoOn (Complex.arg ∘ f ∘ α) (Icc a b) ∨ StrictAntiOn (Complex.arg ∘ f ∘ α) (Icc a b)) says that the principal argument of f(α(t)) is strictly monotone (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) on [a, b].
  - Right-hand side: ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, Complex.arg (deriv f (α t) * deriv α t) = c says that the principal argument of the product f′(α(t)) · α′(t) is constant on [a, b].
  - The theorem asserts an if and only if (↔) between these two statements.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Matches:
  - U is open in ℂ and f is holomorphic on U: hU and hf capture this.
  - α is a smooth curve [interpreted as C¹], with α′(t) ≠ 0: hα and hα'_nonzero capture this.
  - α maps [a, b] into U: hα_range captures this.
  - The left side formalizes “f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a, b]” as strict monotonicity (increasing or decreasing) of Complex.arg ∘ f ∘ α on Icc a b.
  - The right side formalizes “arg(f′(α(t)) α′(t)) is constant.”

- Differences and nuances:
  1) Nonconstancy of f: The natural statement assumes f is nonconstant. The Lean code does not include this assumption; instead it assumes the stronger local condition hderiv_nonzero: f′(α(t)) ≠ 0 on the entire curve. This is a strengthening (specialization) of the original hypothesis. It is reasonable for ensuring the right-hand side’s argument is well-behaved (and also preventing the composition’s velocity from vanishing), but it is an extra assumption not stated in the original.
  2) Domain and arg conventions: The code uses Complex.arg (the principal branch), both for f ∘ α and for f′(α(t)) α′(t). The natural language also uses arg, which is typically the principal argument, though the statement about “changes argument strictly monotonically” in informal mathematics usually presupposes a continuous choice of argument along the curve and often implicitly excludes zeros. The code does not explicitly forbid f(α(t)) = 0; however, Complex.arg is defined at 0 (as 0) in mathlib, so the formal statement still makes sense. This is a conventional formalization choice, but it may differ subtly from the informal expectation of a continuous branch of the argument.
  3) f’s domain: The informal f : U → ℂ is represented as a total f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U and a range condition α(t) ∈ U; this is a standard and faithful formalization.
  4) Smoothness: The code requires DifferentiableOn on Icc (C¹), which matches the intended smoothness needed for derivatives; no issue.

Final assessment:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms come from mathlib.
- The statement is a direct logical “iff” between the monotonicity of arg(f ∘ α) and constancy of arg(f′(α(t)) α′(t)), under natural smoothness and holomorphicity assumptions.
- The main deviation is the added assumption that f′(α(t)) ≠ 0 along the curve (and the implicit use of the principal arg everywhere). This is a mild strengthening and a standard way to make the statement precise and well-defined, not a misrepresentation.

Given these points, the translation is essentially faithful, with small, reasonable technical strengthenings/choices. Hence it deserves a high grade, slightly below perfect due to the extra nonvanishing-derivative hypothesis and the principal-arg convention not being spelled out in the natural language.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 1 / (1 + x ^ 2)` defines the real function f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2).
- `theorem f_analytic_at_zero : ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ ∀ x : ℝ, |x| < r → f x = ∑' (n : ℕ), ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * x ^ (2 * n)` states that there exists some radius r > 0 such that for all real x with |x| < r, f(x) equals the (pointwise) infinite sum Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n}. This is precisely the power series 1 − x^2 + x^4 − x^6 + ... around 0, converging (at least) on some neighborhood of 0.
- `theorem series_convergence_radius_one : (∀ z : ℝ, |z| < 1 → Summable (fun n : ℕ => ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * z ^ (2 * n))) ∧ (∀ z : ℝ, |z| > 1 → ¬Summable (fun n : ℕ => ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * z ^ (2 * n)))` asserts that the series Σ (-1)^n z^{2n} converges for all |z| < 1 and does not converge for any |z| > 1. This characterizes the radius of convergence as 1 (no claim is made about the boundary |z| = 1, which is not needed to determine the radius).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The function matches exactly f(x) = 1/(x^2 + 1).
- ""Show that f is analytic"" is captured by the existence of a power series representation in a neighborhood of 0; the first theorem provides an explicit series and a positive radius r on which it equals f. This is a standard way to state real-analyticity at 0.
- ""find a power series for f at 0"" is satisfied by explicitly giving Σ (-1)^n x^{2n}.
- ""and its radius of convergence"" is addressed by the second theorem, which shows convergence for |z| < 1 and divergence for |z| > 1, hence radius 1.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code gives the correct function, the correct power series at 0, and identifies the radius of convergence as 1. It expresses analyticity at 0 (which is the natural target given the request to produce the local power series at 0). There are no vacuous placeholders or auxiliary fake definitions. The only mild nuance is that it doesn’t assert global analyticity on ℝ, but the original task focuses on analyticity and the power series at 0 with its radius, which the code covers faithfully. Therefore, the translation is legitimate and faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def IsConditionallyConvergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`:
  This defines ""the series with terms a_n (a sequence of real numbers) is conditionally convergent"" to mean that the series ∑ a_n converges (Summable a) and the series of absolute values ∑ |a_n| does not converge (¬ Summable (|a_n|)). This matches the standard definition of conditional convergence for real series.
- `theorem conditional_convergence_of_convergent_not_abs ... : IsConditionallyConvergent a` with hypotheses `h1 : Summable a` and `h2 : ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|`:
  This states: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| does not converge, then the series is conditionally convergent. This is exactly the intended implication.

2) Overall faithfulness:
The natural language statement says: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent. The Lean code formalizes this for real series by defining conditional convergence as convergence without absolute convergence, and the theorem proves (modulo the omitted proof) precisely that implication. Using `¬ Summable` for divergence is standard and correct in this context.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code specializes to real-valued series (ℝ), which is a reasonable and faithful specialization given the natural language context.
- No auxiliary definitions are vacuous; the only new definition is a faithful conjunction of existing Mathlib notions. The theorem statement directly matches the natural language claim. The use of `sorry` is only in the proof, not in definitions, and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.

  This states: For a real sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` and a bijection `σ : ℕ → ℕ`, if the series of absolute values `∑' n, |a n|` is summable (i.e., the series converges absolutely), then the infinite sum `∑' n, a n` equals the infinite sum of the rearranged series `∑' n, a (σ n)`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then any rearrangement has the same sum.
- Lean: Assumes absolute summability (Summable of |a n|) and any bijection σ on ℕ (a rearrangement), and concludes equality of sums via `tsum`.
- This matches the classical theorem precisely: absolute convergence implies rearrangement invariance of the sum.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Indexing: Natural language uses n = 1 to ∞; Lean uses ℕ (starting at 0). This is a harmless indexing shift and is standard in formalizations.
- Target space: Lean specializes to ℝ, while the statement could also hold in ℂ or more general complete normed abelian groups. This is a benign specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms (`Summable`, `tsum`, `Function.Bijective`) are standard Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language theorem.

- `theorem cauchy_product_summable {a b : ℕ → ℝ} (ha : Summable fun n => |a n|) (hb : Summable b) : ... := by sorry`:

  - Hypothesis `hb`: ∑ b n converges.
  - Conclusion (first part): `Summable (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k))` meaning the sequence `c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}` is summable. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` denotes k = 0, ..., n; `n - k` is natural subtraction, which is exact since k ≤ n in the range.
  - Conclusion (second part): `(∑' n, Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)) = (∑' n, a n) * (∑' n, b n)` stating the sum of the series with terms `c_n` equals the product of the sums of `a` and `b`.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges, then the Cauchy product c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} defines a convergent series with sum equal to the product of sums.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes absolute convergence of a (via `Summable (|a n|)`) and convergence of b (`Summable b`), defines the Cauchy product using the finite sum from 0 to n, asserts summability of that series, and asserts the equality of its sum with the product of sums.
- Domain: Lean uses ℝ; the natural language is unspecified, but interpreting over ℝ is a standard and acceptable specialization.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is a direct formalization (proof omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Final check: The two problems are the same. Indexing (0 to n) and convolution form are correct, the summability/absolute summability hypotheses align, and the conclusion states exactly the expected result.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def a (n : ℕ) : ℝ := ...` defines coefficients a(n) for a power series via a finite sum over k = 0..n, taking only even k. Concretely, a(n) = ∑_{0 ≤ k ≤ n, k even} (-1)^{k/2} / ((n - k)! k!). This matches the Cauchy product of the Maclaurin series for e^x and cos x, so these are the intended Maclaurin coefficients of e^x cos x.
- `noncomputable def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := Real.exp x * Real.cos x` defines f(x) = e^x cos x on the reals.
- `theorem f_eq_power_series : ∀ x : ℝ, (∑' n : ℕ, a n * x ^ n) = f x := by sorry` states (without proof) that for every real x, the series with coefficients a(n) sums to f(x). This asserts global equality of f with its Maclaurin series, which in particular implies the series converges for all real x and that f is real-analytic with infinite radius of convergence.
- `theorem radius_of_convergence_infinite : True := by sorry` is a vacuous statement. It does not assert anything about the radius of convergence; it merely states `True`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original asks: show f(x) = e^x cos x is analytic, find a power series at 0, and its radius of convergence.
- The code provides a concrete coefficient formula a(n) that matches the Maclaurin coefficients of e^x cos x, and a theorem stating the resulting series equals f for all real x. That is a correct and even stronger formulation than “analytic at 0” or “analytic on R”.
- However, the radius of convergence part is not faithfully formalized: the separate theorem is just `True`, not a statement about the radius (e.g., infinite radius). This is a red flag per the guidelines: it replaces the required content with a vacuous truth.
- The code does not explicitly state “f is analytic,” but the equality to a power series on all x implies analyticity. This is acceptable as a stronger statement. The major issue remains the vacuous radius theorem.

Final check:
- Are the two problems the same? Not entirely. While the series and equality are correctly specified, the radius-of-convergence claim is not encoded (replaced by `True`). Therefore the translation is not fully faithful.

Conclusion: Fails due to the vacuous radius theorem. If that theorem were corrected to assert infinite radius, the rest would be a good formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]` sets up a general real normed vector space E (not necessarily ℝ^n, but includes it as a special case).
- The theorem `differentiable_on.lipschitz_on_of_bounded_fderiv` states: Let f : E → ℝ and s : Set E. If
  • `h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f s` (f is differentiable on s, in the within-sense),
  • `h_bound : ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧ ∀ x ∈ s, ‖fderiv ℝ f x‖ ≤ C` (there exists a nonnegative uniform bound C on the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative fderiv at every x ∈ s), and
  • `h_compact : IsCompact s` (s is compact),
  then there exists a nonnegative constant K such that `LipschitzOnWith K f s` (i.e., f is K-Lipschitz on s).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be differentiable with ∇f continuous. Show that f is Lipschitz on compact subsets if ∇f is bounded on those subsets.”
- The Lean theorem captures the key conditional: if the derivative (here expressed as the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative) is bounded on a compact subset s, then f is Lipschitz on s. It also allows a more general domain E (a real normed space), which is a benign generalization and acceptable.
- The statement in Lean does not explicitly assume continuity of the gradient/derivative. This is fine because the natural language uses continuity of ∇f to ensure boundedness on compact sets; the theorem only needs the boundedness assumption itself to conclude Lipschitzness.

3) Notable technical differences:
- Domain generalization: E instead of ℝ^n. This is a harmless generalization consistent with Mathlib notions and the intended result.
- Derivative notion: Lean uses the Fréchet derivative `fderiv` (operator norm) rather than the Euclidean gradient; for ℝ^n → ℝ these coincide in norm, so this is faithful.
- Differentiability hypothesis: Lean assumes `DifferentiableOn ℝ f s` (within-s differentiability) rather than global differentiability. The natural statement assumes global differentiability. This is a slight generalization. However, the bound hypothesis is stated using `fderiv ℝ f x` (the unrestricted derivative), not `fderivWithin`. In Mathlib, `fderiv` is only guaranteed to coincide with the actual derivative if `DifferentiableAt` holds; otherwise it defaults to 0. So, as a formalization, one would usually either assume differentiability at points of s (or that s is open), or use `fderivWithin` for a within-s bound. Since the original problem assumes global differentiability, this technical mismatch disappears in the intended setting. Still, it's a minor formal mismatch in the Lean statement relative to the minimal hypotheses.
- Compactness: The theorem requires `IsCompact s`, which matches the “compact subsets” phrasing.

Overall, the Lean statement faithfully expresses: bounded derivative on a compact set implies Lipschitz on that set, which is exactly the thrust of the natural language claim (with acceptable generalization and a small technical nuance about `fderiv` vs `fderivWithin`). There are no vacuous placeholders or fake definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. Hence it passes, with a minor caveat noted above.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {n : ℕ} {K : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} {f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ} {x0 : Fin n → ℝ}` sets up the ambient space as ℝ^n represented by `Fin n → ℝ`, a subset K ⊆ ℝ^n, a function f : ℝ^n → ℝ, and a point x0 ∈ ℝ^n.
- The theorem `fderiv_eq_zero_at_interior_max` assumes:
  • `hK : IsCompact K`: K is compact.
  • `hf_cont : ContinuousOn f K`: f is continuous on K.
  • `hf_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K)`: f is differentiable on the interior of K.
  • `hx0 : x0 ∈ interior K`: the point x0 lies in the interior of K.
  • `hmax : ∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x0`: f attains a (global) maximum on K at x0.
  Conclusion: `fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0`, i.e., the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map ℝ^n → ℝ) at x0 is the zero map.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ, continuous on a compact K ⊆ ℝ^n and differentiable on int(K), if f attains a maximum at x0 ∈ int(K), then Df(x0) = 0.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: same domain/codomain, same regularity assumptions (continuous on K, differentiable on interior K), same hypothesis that x0 ∈ int(K) and is a maximizer on K, and the same conclusion that the derivative at x0 is zero (as a linear map).

3) Final check for differences:
- The representation of ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ` is standard in mathlib; no change in meaning.
- The hypothesis `hmax` explicitly states the global maximum on K, matching “attains a maximum at x0.” Since `hx0 : x0 ∈ interior K`, it follows x0 ∈ K, as desired.
- The conclusion uses `fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0`, which is the correct formal counterpart of Df(x0) = 0.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization.

No substantive differences found; the code is a faithful translation of the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in mathlib.
- `/-- The derivative operator on polynomials over ℝ is a linear map. -/`: A docstring paraphrasing the intended statement.
- `def D : Polynomial ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] Polynomial ℝ := by sorry`: Attempts to define a specific ℝ-linear map from ℝ-polynomials to ℝ-polynomials, purportedly the derivative operator, but leaves the definition/proof as `sorry` (a placeholder), so no actual construction is provided.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: Define D to be the derivative operator on ℝ[t] and show that D is linear. A faithful Lean formalization would either:
- Construct the linear map explicitly from the derivative function (e.g., using `Polynomial.derivation ℝ` and taking its `toLinearMap`), or
- Provide a theorem stating that the derivative is an ℝ-linear map and either reference or build the structure without placeholders.
Here, the code merely declares a definition of type `Polynomial ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] Polynomial ℝ` with `sorry`. It does not define D as the derivative, nor prove linearity; it’s an unfilled placeholder. Thus, it is not a legitimate, faithful translation.

3) Comparison and discrepancies:
- The natural statement explicitly refers to the derivative operator and its linearity. The code neither defines the derivative operator nor proves linearity; it only promises a linear map named `D` with no content.
- The use of `sorry` makes the definition vacuous, violating the guideline against vacuous placeholders. If replaced by a proper construction like `(Polynomial.derivation ℝ).toLinearMap`, it would be faithful, but as given, it is not.

Conclusion: Not faithful. While the type signature matches the intended conclusion, the absence of an actual definition/proof (use of `sorry`) makes it a non-solution.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex` just bring in Mathlib and open the Complex namespace; no mathematical content changed.
- The theorem statement:
  - `{f : ℂ → ℂ}`: f is a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers.
  - `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f univ)`: f is complex-differentiable on the whole set `univ` (i.e., on all of ℂ). In complex analysis in Mathlib, `DifferentiableOn ℂ` corresponds to being holomorphic on the set, and since `univ` is open, this means f is entire/holomorphic on ℂ.
  - `(hf_ne_zero : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0)`: f is nowhere zero on ℂ.
  - Conclusion: `∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, DifferentiableOn ℂ g univ ∧ f = Complex.exp ∘ g`: There exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ that is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on all of ℂ and such that f equals the composition of Complex.exp with g, i.e., for all z, f z = exp (g z).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Let f: ℂ → ℂ be analytic and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show that there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.”
- The Lean statement encodes exactly this: f is holomorphic on ℂ (DifferentiableOn over univ), f is nonvanishing everywhere, and the conclusion is the existence of a holomorphic g on ℂ with f = exp ∘ g (i.e., f = e^g). No extra hypotheses or weakenings are introduced, and no parts are omitted.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Domain/codomain: both ℂ → ℂ.
- Regularity: “analytic/holomorphic” in the natural statement is rendered as `DifferentiableOn ℂ _ univ`, which is the standard Mathlib way to state holomorphic on all of ℂ.
- Nonvanishing: both require f z ≠ 0 for all z.
- Conclusion: existence of entire g with f = e^g is exactly `∃ g, DifferentiableOn ℂ g univ ∧ f = Complex.exp ∘ g`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem has a `sorry` proof placeholder, which is allowed per the task.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem seq_min_limit_nonpos {x : ℕ → ℝ} {l : ℝ} (h : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, |x n - l| < ε) : ...`: We have a real sequence x : ℕ → ℝ and a real number l such that x_n → l in the ε-N sense.
- Conclusion part 1: `(∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, |min (x n) 0 - min l 0| < ε)`: The sequence y_n := min(x_n, 0) converges to min(l, 0) (again in the ε-N sense).
- Conclusion part 2: `∧ min l 0 ≤ 0`: The number min(l, 0) is ≤ 0 (a simple order fact).
So the theorem states: If x_n → l and y_n = min(x_n, 0), then y_n → min(l, 0), and in particular min(l, 0) ≤ 0.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
Natural language: Let {x_n} be convergent and define y_n = min{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≤ 0.
The code assumes an explicit limit l with x_n → l, and proves the stronger statement that y_n → min(l, 0) and min(l, 0) ≤ 0. From this, it follows that lim y_n = min(l, 0) ≤ 0, which is exactly the desired conclusion.

3) Final check of faithfulness:
- Domain: The code works over ℝ, which is a natural and acceptable specialization for the statement involving min with 0.
- Strength: The code proves a stronger result (identifies the limit of y_n), which implies the requested inequality lim y_n ≤ 0.
- No vacuous definitions, no placeholders; a single theorem with standard ε-N convergence. The proof is omitted (sorry), but per instructions we evaluate the statement, not the proof.
Conclusion: The code is a faithful (indeed, stronger) formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The code defines f(n, x) := x / (1 + (n x)^2) as a real-valued function on ℝ, matching f_n(x) in the statement.
- It defines g(a, n, x) := sum over k in Finset.range n of (1 / 2^(k+1)) * f(n, x - a(k+1)), where a : ℕ → ℚ.
  • Finset.range n = {0, 1, ..., n-1}. Reindexing by j = k+1 shows this is ∑_{j=1}^n 2^{-j} f_n(x - a_j), exactly as in the statement.
- The theorem g_tends_to_zero_uniform states: for any a : ℕ → ℚ, for all ε > 0 there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ ℝ, |g a n x| < ε. This is the standard ε–N definition of uniform convergence of g_n to 0 on ℝ.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: given {a_k} an enumeration of ℚ and definitions f_n and g_n as above, show g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ.
- The code matches the definitions exactly, including the index shift and the weights 2^{-k}.
- The theorem statement precisely asserts uniform convergence of g_n to 0 on ℝ.
- The parameter a : ℕ → ℚ is not required to be an enumeration (surjective), but that property is not used in the proof of uniform convergence; the result holds for any sequence a_k in ℚ. Thus the Lean statement is a harmless generalization and still faithful to the intended claim.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; f and g are genuine definitions, and the theorem states the correct property. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Slight generalization: the code assumes only a sequence a : ℕ → ℚ, not that it is an enumeration of all rationals. This does not change the mathematical content of the claimed convergence and is acceptable under the guidelines.
- All other aspects (definitions, domain ℝ, form of uniform convergence) match exactly.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n k : Nat}`: Introduces two natural numbers. In context, `n` will be the dimension of R^n and `k` the number of rectangles.
- `variable (mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Declares an arbitrary function mstar from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as `Fin n → ℝ`) to real numbers. No properties (like being an outer measure) are assumed.
- `def IsOpenRectangle (s : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “open rectangle” that is always True, i.e., every set qualifies. This is vacuous and not a faithful definition.
- `theorem mstar_union_disjoint_open_rectangles ... : mstar (⋃ i : Fin k, R i) = Finset.univ.sum fun i => mstar (R i) := by sorry`: States that for any family `R : Fin k → Set (Fin n → ℝ)`, if each `R i` satisfies the vacuous `IsOpenRectangle` and the family is pairwise disjoint, then mstar of the union equals the sum of mstar over the parts. There is no proof (`sorry`), but the statement is made.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let m^* be the outer measure on ℝ^n. Suppose R_1,...,R_n (rectangles) are pairwise disjoint open rectangles. Then m^*(⋃ R_k) = ∑ m^*(R_k).
- Discrepancies:
  - The code treats `mstar` as an arbitrary function from sets to ℝ, not as the (Lebesgue) outer measure. It lacks any assumption that `mstar` is an outer measure (or even an outer measure structure). This is a major mismatch.
  - The codomain is ℝ rather than the usual ℝ≥0∞ for outer measures in Mathlib. Another mismatch.
  - The “open rectangle” predicate is defined as `True`, so the hypothesis that the `R i` are open rectangles is vacuous and imposes no restriction. This is a blatant placeholder and not a faithful definition.
  - The code uses `k` for the number of rectangles and `n` for the dimension. The natural statement reuses `n` for both. The code’s separation is a harmless and reasonable clarification, not a problem.
- Because of the vacuous predicate and the missing outer measure structure/hypotheses, the statement in Lean is not a faithful formalization of the given theorem.

3) Final comparison:
- Same core mathematical claim intended: finite additivity of m^* on pairwise disjoint open rectangles in ℝ^n.
- Differences breaking faithfulness:
  - `mstar` is not required to be the outer measure; no properties are assumed.
  - Wrong codomain type (ℝ instead of ℝ≥0∞), conflicting with standard outer measure formalization.
  - “Open rectangle” predicate is vacuous.
  - The theorem is thus stated far more generally (and incorrectly) for any function mstar and any sets, due to the vacuous predicate.
Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.

Given that if the vacuous predicate were replaced by a correct definition and `mstar` were an OuterMeasure on ℝ^n, the shape of the theorem would match the natural statement, I assign a mid-level grade reflecting vacuous placeholders but potentially fixable structure.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def box (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := { x | ∀ i, a i ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ b i }`
  Interprets a closed rectangle in ℝ^n as all points x whose i-th coordinate lies in [a_i, b_i] for every i. This matches a standard closed box; it does not enforce `a i ≤ b i` globally, but still yields the intended set (possibly empty if some `a_i > b_i`).

- `def has_zero_side (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Prop := ∃ i, a i = b i`
  Says the box has a degenerate side of length zero if some coordinate interval collapses to a point. This correctly captures “one side of length 0.”

- `def bounded_on {α} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : Prop := ∃ M : ℝ, 0 ≤ M ∧ ∀ x ∈ s, |f x| ≤ M`
  A standard boundedness predicate on a set. This matches the natural language assumption that f is bounded on R.

- `def Riemann_integrable_on {α} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : Prop := True`
  This is a placeholder and makes every function “Riemann integrable on s.” This is vacuous and not faithful to the intended notion of Riemann integrability.

- `def integral_on {α} (f : α → ℝ) (s : Set α) : ℝ := 0`
  This is a placeholder that defines the integral to be 0 for all functions and sets. This is also vacuous and not faithful.

- The main theorem:
  `theorem degenerate_box_integral (a b : Fin n → ℝ) (h : has_zero_side a b)
    (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (hf : bounded_on f (box a b)) :
    Riemann_integrable_on f (box a b) ∧ integral_on f (box a b) = 0 := by sorry`
  In words: for a closed box with a zero-length side and any function bounded on that box, f is Riemann integrable on the box and the integral is 0. This mirrors the intended statement structurally, except:
  - It uses a function `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with boundedness restricted to the box. This is a standard and acceptable formalization choice compared to `f : R → ℝ`.
  - However, because `Riemann_integrable_on` is defined as `True` and `integral_on` is always `0`, the statement is vacuous: the conclusion holds regardless of `f`, `a`, `b`, or `hf`.

Faithfulness check to the original statement:
- The original statement: If R ⊆ ℝ^n is a closed rectangle with one side of length 0, then every bounded function f : R → ℝ is Riemann integrable on R and ∫_R f = 0.
- The Lean code sets up a box and the zero-side condition correctly and encodes boundedness on that box. However, the crucial notions of Riemann integrability and integral are replaced by vacuous placeholders (`True` and constant 0). Thus the formal statement does not capture the real content.
- Additionally, the proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions, but the key issue remains the placeholder definitions.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to vacuous placeholder definitions for integrability and integral. If those were replaced by legitimate Mathlib notions, the theorem statement would closely match the original (the domain presentation is a standard acceptable formalization). Hence this fits the rubric case: vacuous definitions but the intended final theorem would be faithful if fixed.

- Natural statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2 and the Hessian H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- Lean statement: In a finite-dimensional real normed space E (a generalization of ℝ^n), with U convex, and f ∈ C^2 on U (ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, which entails the existence and continuity of all derivatives up to order 2), the second-order Taylor expansion (expressed via the formal Taylor series p) has a remainder bounded by ε‖h‖^2 uniformly on compact K ⊆ U for small ‖h‖, provided x + h ∈ U.
- This captures exactly the uniform second-order remainder estimate on compact subsets. The convexity of U, together with x ∈ U (since x ∈ K ⊆ U) and x + h ∈ U, ensures the segment is in U (useful for standard proofs), and the code makes this assumption explicit.
- The existence of p and HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 is a standard reformulation of having derivatives up to order 2 and does not weaken or distort the claim; it merely packages the derivative data used in the Taylor expansion.

3) Comparison and potential differences:
- Domain generalization: E is any finite-dimensional normed real vector space instead of ℝ^n; this is a harmless generalization and is standard in Mathlib.
- Regularity assumptions: The natural statement mentions C^2 and continuity of the Hessian on U; ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U implies both, so the Lean assumptions are fully aligned (possibly slightly stronger formulation but equivalent in spirit).
- Explicit requirement x + h ∈ U: This is implicit in the natural statement (you must be able to evaluate f(x + h) and use convexity along the segment). Including it is appropriate, not a discrepancy.
- Extra existential (p): This is additional structure but fully faithful and helpful for expressing the Taylor terms; it does not render the claim vacuous or different.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts are from Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful (slightly more general) formalization of the natural language statement about uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets of a convex set.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {K : Type _} [Field K]` sets the scalar field K. The problem is set over an arbitrary field, which is standard.
- `variable {n : Nat} {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) K}` declares A as an n-by-n matrix over K.
- `lemma det_eq_zero_implies_cols_linear_dependent (h : Matrix.det A = 0) : ∃ c : Fin n → K, c ≠ 0 ∧ A.mulVec c = 0` states: If det(A) = 0, then there exists a nonzero vector c in K^n such that A c = 0. This is exactly: there is a nontrivial linear relation among the columns of A (a nontrivial combination of columns gives the zero vector), i.e., columns are linearly dependent.
- `lemma det_ne_zero_implies_cols_linear_independent (h : Matrix.det A ≠ 0) : ∀ c : Fin n → K, A.mulVec c = 0 → c = 0` states: If det(A) ≠ 0, then the only solution to A c = 0 is c = 0. This is precisely the definition that the columns are linearly independent.
Both statements use `mulVec` to represent matrix-vector multiplication, so they refer to linear dependence/independence of columns.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First part: det(A) = 0 implies the columns are linearly dependent. Matches the first lemma exactly.
- Second part: det(A) ≠ 0 implies the columns are linearly independent. Matches the second lemma exactly.
- The natural language mentions ""columns (or rows)"". The code formalizes the column version. The parenthetical ""or rows"" indicates either version is acceptable; the column version is a standard and faithful choice.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The code relies entirely on Mathlib's matrix, determinant, and matrix-vector multiplication.
- The code generalizes to any field K and any n (including n = 0, which is harmless and consistent). This is a standard, acceptable generalization.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only difference is that the code does not explicitly state the analogous row statements. Given the phrasing ""columns (or rows)"", choosing columns is faithful.
- The instruction about not using Laplace formula is a proof method constraint; since we are only checking the statement, this is irrelevant.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful formalization of the natural language claims about columns. No auxiliary vacuous definitions; the translation is correct.

- “Entire” and “holomorphic on ℂ” are used consistently via `Differentiable ℂ`.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line into natural language.
- The theorem `rademacher_on_convex` is stated for a type `E` that is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space: `[NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`. It also assumes measurable/measure/Borel/second-countable structure: `[MeasurableSpace E] [MeasureSpace E] [BorelSpace E] [SecondCountableTopology E]`. This is the standard setting to talk about Lebesgue (volume) measure and differentiation in finite-dimensional spaces; it generalizes ℝ^n.
- `f : E → ℝ` is a real-valued function, and `U : Set E` is a subset.
- `hU : Convex ℝ U` assumes U is convex.
- `L : NNReal` and `hL : LipschitzOnWith L f U` assert that f is L-Lipschitz on U.
- Conclusion: `∀ᵐ x ∂volume, x ∈ U → DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f U x`. This means: for volume (Lebesgue) measure on E, for almost every x, if x ∈ U then f is differentiable within U at x. Equivalently, with respect to the measure restricted to U, f is differentiable within U almost everywhere.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ, Lipschitz on a convex set U ⊆ ℝ^n, show f is differentiable almost everywhere on U (Rademacher's theorem in this context). The text says “differentiable and Lipschitz,” but that would make the conclusion trivial; this looks like an accidental redundancy, and the intended content is the standard Rademacher result.
- The Lean statement generalizes from ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E, which is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- It uses “DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f U x” rather than “DifferentiableAt ℝ f x.” For a function Lipschitz on a set U (not assumed open), the within-version is the correct formulation. It captures “differentiable on U almost everywhere” in the sense appropriate for subsets. This matches the usual formalization of Rademacher on (possibly non-open) convex sets.
- The measure used is `volume`, i.e., Lebesgue measure in this context. The code introduces `[MeasureSpace E]` explicitly; in Mathlib, for finite-dimensional real normed spaces, the canonical `volume` is Lebesgue measure (up to the standard normalization). The statement is thus with respect to Lebesgue measure, as intended.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain/codomain: ℝ^n → ℝ vs. E → ℝ with E finite-dimensional over ℝ. This is a benign generalization matching the intent.
- Hypotheses: The natural statement redundantly says “differentiable and Lipschitz” on U; the Lean version requires only Lipschitz on U. This makes the Lean statement strictly stronger than the (likely intended) theorem. This is acceptable as a slight generalization and does not misrepresent the theorem.
- Conclusion: The Lean code asserts almost-everywhere differentiability within U, which is the right notion for a subset; this aligns with the intended “on U” phrasing.
- Measure: The theorem is stated with respect to `volume` on E. Although `[MeasureSpace E]` is taken as an instance parameter, in the intended usage this is the canonical Lebesgue measure on finite-dimensional real normed spaces. This matches the natural language’s “with respect to Lebesgue measure.”

No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no vacuous placeholders. The statement is a faithful and slightly more general formalization of the intended Rademacher theorem on a convex set.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` and `variable {R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)}`: We are working in ℝ^n, modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`. `R` is a subset of ℝ^n.
- `variable (riemann_integrable_on : ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate that is supposed to mean “Riemann integrable on a set,” but it is just a variable placeholder, not Mathlib’s notion.
- `variable (riemann_integral_on : ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Introduces an arbitrary function that is supposed to represent the Riemann integral of a function over a set, but again is a placeholder.
- `variable (closed_set : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)`: An arbitrary predicate intended to mean “closed set,” but not Mathlib’s `IsClosed`.
- `variable (outer_measure_zero : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)`: An arbitrary predicate intended to mean “outer measure zero,” but not tied to Lebesgue outer measure or any Mathlib definition.

The theorem:
- `theorem integral_eq_of_eq_off_null {f g : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ} ...`: States that if `f` and `g` are “Riemann integrable on R” per the placeholder predicate, and there exists a set `E` with `closed_set E` and `outer_measure_zero E`, and `f = g` on `R \ E`, then `riemann_integral_on f R = riemann_integral_on g R`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n; f,g: R → ℝ are Riemann integrable. There exists a closed set E ⊆ R with (Lebesgue) outer measure zero such that f = g on R \ E. Conclude the integrals over R are equal.
- Code issues:
  - The code does not enforce or even mention that R is a closed rectangle. It treats R as an arbitrary set with no constraints. This is at best a generalization, but more crucially, the meaning of integrability depends on R being a rectangle in Riemann theory.
  - The code’s key notions are arbitrary placeholders: `riemann_integrable_on`, `riemann_integral_on`, `closed_set`, `outer_measure_zero`. They are not Mathlib’s definitions. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous placeholders.
  - The code does not require E ⊆ R; the original statement does. While the conclusion may still hold without explicitly assuming E ⊆ R (since only R \ E is used), the original hypothesis is stricter.
  - The domain of f and g in the code is all of ℝ^n, not just R. That is a standard formalization choice (restricting integration to R via the set parameter), so this part is acceptable.
  - No connection to Lebesgue outer measure is made; `outer_measure_zero` is an arbitrary predicate and could denote anything.

Final check:
- The code is not a faithful translation because it replaces all the substantive mathematical notions with arbitrary placeholders and omits the essential structural assumption on R (closed rectangle) and the specific nature of outer measure. Even if the theorem were later proved, as stated it asserts a property about arbitrary predicates/functions, not about Riemann integration and Lebesgue outer measure.
- If these placeholders were replaced with Mathlib’s actual notions (e.g., `IsClosed`, a proper definition of Riemann integrability on a rectangle, and Lebesgue outer measure zero), and optionally adding E ⊆ R (or noting it’s not needed), then the statement would likely be faithful. As written, it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Grade justification:
- Vacuous/placeholder predicates are used instead of Mathlib concepts, so it fails faithfulness (score 0). If fixed, the final theorem could be faithful to the natural language statement, so a mid-level grade per rubric is appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem riemann_integrable_on_algebra {n : Nat} (R : Set (Fin n -> ℝ)) ...` introduces a natural number `n`, a set `R` of points in `ℝ^n` (represented as `Fin n → ℝ`).
- `(is_riemann_integrable_on : Set (Fin n -> ℝ) -> ((Fin n -> ℝ) -> ℝ) -> Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate taking a set `R` and a function `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` and returning a proposition. This is intended to stand in for “is Riemann integrable on R,” but it is completely abstract here.
- `(f g : (Fin n -> ℝ) -> ℝ) (a : ℝ)` declare two functions and a scalar.
- `(hf : is_riemann_integrable_on R f) (hg : is_riemann_integrable_on R g)` assume that the predicate holds for `f` and `g` on `R`.
- Conclusion: `is_riemann_integrable_on R (fun x => a * f x) ∧ is_riemann_integrable_on R (fun x => f x + g x) ∧ is_riemann_integrable_on R (fun x => f x * g x)` asserts closure of the predicate under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication. The proof is `by sorry` (left as a placeholder), which is acceptable for this task if the statement itself is faithful.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For a closed rectangle `R ⊆ ℝ^n`, the set of Riemann integrable functions on `R` is an algebra: if `f, g` are Riemann integrable on `R` and `a ∈ ℝ`, then `af`, `f+g`, and `fg` are Riemann integrable on `R`.
- Discrepancies:
  - The code does not encode that `R` is a closed rectangle; `R` is an arbitrary subset of `ℝ^n`.
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s notion of Riemann integrability (or any concrete integrability predicate). Instead, it quantifies over an arbitrary predicate `is_riemann_integrable_on`, with no properties assumed. This makes the theorem statement claim closure for any predicate whatsoever, which is not faithful to the intended meaning.
  - Thus, the theorem as stated is far more general (and in fact unjustified) than the original, and not a faithful formalization of “Riemann integrable on a closed rectangle.”

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement asserts closure under operations for an arbitrary predicate and arbitrary `R`, not specifically Riemann integrability on a closed rectangle. It omits the key mathematical structure and uses no Mathlib definition corresponding to Riemann integrability. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Given these issues, the code is not faithful. If one were to replace `is_riemann_integrable_on` by the correct Mathlib predicate for Riemann integrability on a closed rectangle (and actually assume `R` is such a rectangle), the statement would become faithful. As written, however, it is not.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- The theorem `power_series_zero_of_accumulation` takes coefficients `a : ℕ → ℂ`, a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, and a sequence `zseq : ℕ → ℂ`.
- Assumption 1: `∃ r > 0, ∀ z, |z| < r → f z = ∑' k, a k * z^k`. This means there is a radius r such that on the punctured open disk of radius r around 0, f equals the power series with coefficients a. This captures that f is given by the convergent power series in a neighborhood of 0.
- Assumption 2: `∀ n, zseq n ≠ 0`. The sequence terms are all nonzero.
- Assumption 3: `Tendsto zseq atTop (nhds 0)`. The sequence converges to 0.
- Assumption 4: `∀ n, f (zseq n) = 0`. Each sequence term is a zero of f.
- Conclusion: `∀ k, a k = 0`. All coefficients vanish.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness.
- The natural language statement says f is a convergent power series f(z) = ∑ a_k z^k (i.e., equal to that power series near 0), there is a sequence of nonzero complex numbers z_n → 0 with f(z_n) = 0, then all a_k = 0. The Lean hypothesis precisely formalizes “f equals the power series on a neighborhood of 0” via the existence of r > 0 and an equality on |z| < r. The sequence conditions match exactly: nonzero, converging to 0, and f(z_n) = 0 for all n. The conclusion matches: all coefficients are zero.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing of the sequence from ℕ (including 0) vs {1,2,...} is a harmless formalization choice.
- The Lean statement is slightly more explicit about the neighborhood where the series equals f, which is standard for a convergent power series representation. No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced. No mismatch in mathematical meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {a b : ℝ} {f : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ} {f_lim g : ℝ → ℝ}`: We work on the real line. We have an interval endpoints a, b ∈ ℝ. We have a sequence of real-valued functions (f n) on ℝ and a limit function f_lim : ℝ → ℝ, and a function g : ℝ → ℝ.
- The theorem statement:
  Hypotheses:
  • `h : TendstoUniformlyOn (fun n => f n) f_lim atTop (Set.Icc a b)` means f_n → f_lim uniformly on the closed interval [a, b].
  • `hg : ContinuousOn g (Set.Icc a b)` means g is continuous on [a, b].
  Conclusion:
  • `Tendsto (fun n => intervalIntegral (fun x => f n x * g x) a b) atTop (𝓝 (intervalIntegral (fun x => f_lim x * g x) a b))` means the sequence of integrals ∫_a^b f_n(x) g(x) dx converges to ∫_a^b f_lim(x) g(x) dx. Here `intervalIntegral` is the (Lebesgue) integral over the interval [a, b] (with orientation, so it also makes sense if a > b), and `Tendsto ... atTop (𝓝 ...)` denotes usual convergence of real numbers.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f_n → f uniformly on [a,b] and g is continuous on [a,b], then lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n g = ∫_a^b f g.
- The Lean theorem matches this: it assumes uniform convergence on [a,b] and continuity of g on [a,b], and concludes that the integrals of the products f_n·g converge to the integral of f·g on [a,b]. The use of `intervalIntegral (fun x => f n x * g x) a b` exactly captures ∫_a^b f_n g. The limit formulation via `Tendsto` corresponds to lim_{n→∞}. The domain [a,b] is represented by `Set.Icc a b` and the integral is over that interval.

3) Differences and potential caveats:
- The Lean code uses the Lebesgue interval integral (defined for all functions, returning 0 for non-integrable functions), while the natural language statement is typically interpreted for Riemann integrals (or Lebesgue integrals with integrability understood). The code does not include explicit measurability/integrability assumptions. This is a minor formalization nuance: as a statement, it asserts the same convergence of integrals under the same topological hypotheses. It can be viewed as a slight generalization in the sense of using the standard Mathlib integral notion; the natural language did not specify the integral type. This is acceptable as a faithful translation per the guidelines.
- The code handles the oriented interval integral (works also if a > b), while the natural statement typically assumes a ≤ b. This is a harmless generalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Overall, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim: same hypotheses (uniform convergence on [a,b], continuity of g on [a,b]) and same conclusion (convergence of ∫ f_n g to ∫ f g over [a,b]). The slight differences (Lebesgue vs possibly Riemann, allowance of a > b) are acceptable generalizations and do not alter the essence of the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library of mathematics.

  Natural language: For any natural numbers n and m, any ℝ-linear map A from (Fin n → ℝ) to (Fin m → ℝ) (i.e., from ℝ^n to ℝ^m), and any point x in ℝ^n, the function underlying A is Fréchet differentiable at x with derivative equal to A, viewed as a continuous linear map.

  Natural language: For any such A and x, the Fréchet derivative fderiv of the function A at x is exactly A (as a continuous linear map).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean code models ℝ^n and ℝ^m as (Fin n → ℝ) and (Fin m → ℝ), which is standard in Mathlib.
- It uses the Fréchet derivative notion `HasFderivAt` and `fderiv` appropriate for functions between normed vector spaces, which matches the usual differentiability in ℝ^n.
- The derivative is expressed as a continuous linear map `→L[ℝ]`, and `A.toContinuousLinearMap` is the canonical way to view a linear map between finite-dimensional spaces as continuous (which is mathematically equivalent to saying the derivative equals A as a linear map).
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only theorem statements. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the instructions since we only audit the translation, not the proof.
- The statements assert differentiability at every x and that the derivative equals A, precisely matching the natural language statement.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Original: A: ℝ^n → ℝ^m linear operator; prove differentiable everywhere and DA(x) = A as a linear map.
- Lean: For A: (Fin n → ℝ) →ₗ[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ) and any x, `HasFderivAt` holds with derivative `A.toContinuousLinearMap`; equivalently `fderiv` at x equals `A.toContinuousLinearMap`.
- No differences in substance. The Lean formalization uses the standard Mathlib framework and is a faithful translation.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in R^n where n is a natural number.
- `theorem graph_has_measure_zero (U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (hU : IsOpen U) (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (hf : ContinuousOn f U) : ... = 0`:
  • U is a subset of R^n (represented as `Fin n → ℝ`), and `hU : IsOpen U` states that U is open.
  • f is a function from R^n to R, and `hf : ContinuousOn f U` says f is continuous on U (with respect to the subspace topology).
  • The set `{ x : (Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ | x.1 ∈ U ∧ x.2 = f x.1 }` is the graph of f over U, viewed as a subset of R^n × R ≃ R^{n+1}.
  • `MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume (...) = 0` asserts that the Lebesgue measure (volume) of this graph is zero in R^{n+1}.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- The natural language statement: U ⊆ R^n is open, f: U → R is continuous, and G = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈ U} has measure zero in R^{n+1}.
- The Lean statement: Exactly the same set G (as a subset of R^n × R) is defined and asserted to have Lebesgue measure zero. The use of `ContinuousOn f U` with f defined on all of R^n is a standard way in Lean to model a function defined on U only. The measure used is the canonical Lebesgue (Haar) measure `volume` on R^{n+1} (here represented as the product space `(Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ`).

3) Final check for differences:
- The only minor difference is that Lean takes f to be a total function on R^n with continuity assumed only on U (`ContinuousOn f U`), rather than a function with domain U. This is a harmless formalization detail: the graph uses only values on U, so it faithfully represents the intended graph of a function defined on U. Everything else (openness of U, continuity on U, graph set, and measure zero conclusion in R^{n+1}) matches precisely.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib. No direct effect on the statement.
- `axiom RiemannIntegrableOn {n : ℕ} (f : (Fin n → Real) → Real) (R : Set (Fin n → Real)) : Prop`: Introduces an uninterpreted predicate symbol `RiemannIntegrableOn f R` asserting that `f` is “Riemann integrable on R”. This is a new axiom (placeholder), not tied to Mathlib’s real notion of (Riemann) integrability.
- The theorem `max_min_riemann_integrable` states: For any `n`, any set `R : Set (Fin n → Real)`, and functions `f, g : (Fin n → Real) → Real`, if `RiemannIntegrableOn f R` and `RiemannIntegrableOn g R`, then both `x ↦ max (f x) (g x)` and `x ↦ min (f x) (g x)` are `RiemannIntegrableOn` on `R`. The proof is omitted using `sorry`.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n, and f, g: R → ℝ are Riemann integrable. Then φ(x) = max{f(x), g(x)} and ψ(x) = min{f(x), g(x)} are Riemann integrable on R.
- Key mismatches:
  - The code does not assert or encode that `R` is a closed rectangle. It treats `R` as an arbitrary set.
  - The predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` is an uninterpreted axiom, not Mathlib’s notion of Riemann integrability on a rectangle. It has no properties and could mean anything. This is a vacuous placeholder, not a faithful definition.
  - The functions in the code have domain ℝ^n with an “on R” predicate; in the statement, f and g have domain R. That difference could be acceptable if `RiemannIntegrableOn` were properly defined (it often is formulated as integrable on a set), but here it is not.
  - No mathematical structure for closed rectangles (e.g., boxes, `Icc` products) is used or referenced.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code replaces “Riemann integrability on a closed rectangle” with a completely unspecified predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` on an arbitrary set `R`. The essential assumption that `R` is a closed rectangle is not present, and the integrability concept is not defined using Mathlib. This fails the faithfulness requirement.

Other notes per guidelines:
- The auxiliary definition (axiom) is vacuous/uninterpreted and not a faithful Mathlib concept.
- The theorem statement is also more general (any set) and relies on the placeholder predicate, so even if the placeholder were replaced, the missing closed-rectangle assumption would still need to be encoded.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:

- `variable {α : Type _} [MetricSpace α]`: Work in an arbitrary type α equipped with a metric space structure; this matches the context “in a metric space”.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: In a metric space, S is open iff for every p ∈ S there exists ε > 0 with B(p, ε) ⊆ S. In Mathlib, `Metric.ball p ε` denotes the open ball {x | dist x p < ε}, which corresponds to B(p, ε) as typically used in the statement.

- Conclusion: There exist a natural number k and functions a, b : Fin k → Fin n → ℝ such that for each i, the set Set.Icc (a i) (b i) (the closed order interval in the product order on Fin n → ℝ, i.e., an axis-aligned closed rectangle/box) is closed; S is contained in the finite union ⋃ i, Set.Icc (a i) (b i); and the interiors of these rectangles are pairwise disjoint, formalized as interior (Icc (a i) (b i)) ∩ interior (Icc (a j) (b j)) = ∅ whenever i ≠ j.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The target statement: Given U ⊆ ℝ^n open and S ⊆ U compact Jordan measurable, there exist finitely many closed rectangles P_j ⊆ U covering S, with mutually disjoint interiors.
- The code captures: finite family of closed rectangles in ℝ^n whose interiors are pairwise disjoint and whose union covers S.
- However, it omits a crucial requirement: each rectangle P_j should be contained in U. The Lean statement does not include P_j ⊆ U. It only ensures S ⊆ U and S ⊆ ⋃ P_j, with no constraint that the P_j lie within U.
- Additionally, the natural language hypothesis includes that S is Jordan measurable; the Lean hypotheses do not include any Jordan measurability assumption. This is a generalization (stronger claim) and could be acceptable per the guidelines if everything else matched, but combined with the missing containment-in-U condition, it deviates materially from the original statement.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - Missing requirement P_j ⊆ U in the Lean theorem (significant).
  - The Lean code does not assume S is Jordan measurable (generalization of the hypothesis).
- Other aspects match: R^n model, finite union of axis-aligned closed rectangles via Icc, pairwise disjoint interiors, coverage of S.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to the missing constraint that the rectangles lie inside U. The omission is essential to the original statement.

Here `∑'` denotes the infinite sum (tsum) and absolute convergence is expressed as `Summable (fun n => |·|)` for ℝ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement assumes absolute convergence of ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n, defines c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}, and concludes that ∑ c_n converges absolutely and its sum equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- The Lean code exactly encodes these hypotheses and conclusions for real sequences a, b: it defines c_n as the finite convolution sum, assumes absolute summability of a and b via `Summable (|a n|)` and `Summable (|b n|)`, and concludes absolute summability of c together with the product-of-sums identity using `tsum`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is a slight specialization to ℝ (real sequences) in Lean, whereas the natural language statement does not specify the field (often ℝ or ℂ). This is an acceptable slight specialization per the guidelines.
- No vacuous placeholders are used; the auxiliary definition `c` is the correct finite sum. The theorem statement matches the mathematical content. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem lim_y_nonneg (l : ℝ) (h : Filter.Tendsto x Filter.atTop (nhds l)) : 0 ≤ (max l 0) := by sorry`: States simply that 0 ≤ max(l,0). This is true regardless of h and does not explicitly mention y or its limit, despite the docstring claiming it concludes about the limit of y_n.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The main mathematical content needed to prove “lim y_n ≥ 0” is that if x_n → l, then y_n → max(l,0), and max(l,0) ≥ 0. The first theorem directly formalizes the stronger statement that y_n converges and identifies its limit as max(l,0). From this, the desired conclusion lim y_n ≥ 0 follows immediately.
- The second theorem’s statement does not explicitly mention the limit of y_n and is weaker/trivial, but it’s not harmful. The essential translation is already provided by the first theorem.
- The auxiliary definition `y` is legitimate (not vacuous), and Mathlib notions (Filter.Tendsto, atTop, nhds, max) are used appropriately. Proofs are omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable per the auditing instructions.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: Given a convergent sequence x_n and y_n = max{x_n,0}, show lim y_n ≥ 0.
- Lean: If x_n → l, then y_n → max(l,0). This implies lim y_n exists and equals max(l,0) ≥ 0. Thus, the Lean statement is a slight strengthening that entails the original claim.
- Minor mismatch: The second theorem’s docstring claims the “in particular” conclusion but its formal statement doesn’t mention y_n or the limit. Nonetheless, the first theorem already captures the core statement needed.

Conclusion: Overall, the code provides an essentially faithful translation (indeed a stronger one) of the natural language statement, with a small mismatch in the “in particular” lemma’s formalization. Hence it passes, with a minor deduction.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code to natural language:
- `variable {α : Type _} [CommRing α]`: We are working over a commutative ring α (entries of matrices lie in α).
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type for rows/columns is a finite type n with decidable equality; thus matrices are n-by-n where |n| is the size.
- `open Matrix`: Open the Matrix namespace.
- `theorem det_adjugate (A : Matrix n n α) : Matrix.det (Matrix.adjugate A) = Matrix.det A ^ (Fintype.card n - 1) := by sorry`: For any n-by-n matrix A over α, the determinant of the adjugate of A equals (det A)^(|n| − 1).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If A is n-by-n and B is the matrix of cofactors of A, show det(B) = det(A)^{n−1}. The matrix of cofactors is, in standard conventions, the cofactor matrix; the adjugate (classical adjoint) is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Determinant is invariant under transpose, so det(cofactor matrix) = det(adjugate A). Thus the Lean statement using `Matrix.adjugate A` matches the intended target for B up to transpose, which does not affect the determinant.
- The exponent matches: Lean writes `Fintype.card n - 1`, which is the size of the index set minus one, corresponding exactly to the n−1 in the statement.
- The ring of coefficients is a general commutative ring, which is a standard and acceptable generalization of the usual field/commutative ring context for adjugate identities.

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the code directly states the theorem using Mathlib's `Matrix.adjugate` and `Matrix.det`.
- The only potential subtlety is the cofactor matrix vs adjugate (transpose), but since determinant is unchanged by transpose, the equality is the same. Hence the formal statement faithfully captures the natural language statement.
- Slight generalization to any commutative ring and arbitrary finite index type is acceptable and standard.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given mathematical statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem takes data: c : ℕ → ℝ (coefficients), a, ρ : ℝ with hρ : 0 < ρ, defines I := { x | |x - a| < ρ }, and a function f : ℝ → ℝ.
- Assumption hf: for every x ∈ I, the series ∑ c n (x - a)^n sums to f x, i.e. HasSum (fun n => c n * (x - a) ^ n) (f x).
- Conclusion: (i) f is differentiable at every x ∈ I (DifferentiableAt ℝ f x). (ii) For every x ∈ I, there exists s such that the termwise derivative series ∑ (n+1) c(n+1) (x - a)^n sums to s, and HasDerivAt f s x holds. This asserts that the derivative exists at x and equals the sum of the derived series.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Given a power series with radius of convergence 0 < ρ ≤ ∞, define I = {x : |x - a| < ρ} and let f be its sum on I. Then f is differentiable and f'(x) = ∑ (n+1) c_{n+1} (x - a)^n, with radius of convergence equal to ρ for the derivative series.
- The code correctly captures: defining I as the open ball of radius ρ, requiring that on I the series sums to f, proving differentiability on I, and that the derivative equals the sum of the termwise derivative series.
- Missing/changed aspects:
  - The code does not encode that the original series has radius of convergence ρ. It only assumes convergence on I; no statement about behavior near the boundary or outside I.
  - The conclusion does not state that the derivative series has radius of convergence equal to ρ. It only asserts convergence for x ∈ I (i.e., at points strictly inside radius ρ), giving no global radius statement nor any optimality/equality claim.
  - The natural language allows ρ = ∞; the code treats ρ as a real number and does not address the ∞ case.

3) Final comparison:
- The differentiability and the formula for f'(x) are faithfully captured.(Good.)
- The crucial clause “with radius of convergence equal to ρ” for the derivative series is not present in the formal statement; only convergence on I is asserted. Also, the hypothesis that the original series has radius exactly ρ is not encoded.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly weaker than the natural language statement and omits the radius equality part.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholders; the main differentiability/termwise differentiation component is correct, but the radius-of-convergence equality is missing. This is a significant omission, so not faithful overall.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` and using `(Fin n → ℝ)` model ℝ^n as functions from `Fin n` to ℝ. The codomain is ℝ, so f : ℝ^n → ℝ.
- The lemma is named `taylor_remainder_o2_uniform_on_compact` and takes:
  - `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)`: a subset of ℝ^n.
  - `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`: the function.
  - `hU : Convex ℝ U`: U is convex.
  - `hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U`: f is C^2 on U (in the standard Mathlib sense of 2-times continuously Fréchet differentiable on the set U).
- The conclusion: For every compact set `K ⊆ U`, and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all `x ∈ K` and for all `h` with `‖h‖ < δ` and `x + h ∈ U`, one has the estimate
  | f(x+h) - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) h - (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here:
  - `fderiv ℝ f x` is the Fréchet derivative at x (a continuous linear map), so `(fderiv ℝ f x) h` is the usual first-order term.
  - `fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x` is the second derivative at x, valued in bilinear form via currying: it takes `h` to a linear map which is then applied to `h` again, i.e., the quadratic term given by the Hessian applied to (h, h).
  - The factor `(1/2)` matches the standard Taylor expansion of order 2.
- The quantifiers are uniform in x over K because δ depends only on ε and K, not on x.
- The guard `x + h ∈ U` ensures evaluations remain in the domain where derivatives are defined; combined with `K ⊆ U` and convexity of U, this is the standard setup for Taylor's theorem along the line segment from x to x+h.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: f : ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2, and H_f (the Hessian) is continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor remainder is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- Lean assumptions: `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` expresses that f is C^2 on U, which entails existence and continuity of the second derivative (Hessian) on U in finite-dimensional spaces. Thus it faithfully captures “f is C^2 and Hessian continuous on U.” The convexity hypothesis `Convex ℝ U` is included, matching the statement.
- Lean conclusion: The ε-δ inequality with the quadratic bound ε‖h‖^2, uniform in x ∈ K, is exactly the uniform little-o formulation on compact subsets. The presence of `x + h ∈ U` aligns with working on a possibly non-open convex set U and is standard; it does not weaken the uniform little-o claim.
- The second-order term is written via the second Fréchet derivative in Mathlib; this is the precise formal version of the Hessian quadratic form evaluated at (h, h) with the 1/2 factor.

Final check — same or different?
- Domain/codomain, regularity, convexity: match.
- Uniform-on-compact formulation: matches, with standard ε-δ phrasing.
- Second-order Taylor polynomial and remainder: matches exactly, with correct 1/2 factor and use of the Hessian/second derivative.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- Minor phrasing difference: the Lean code assumes `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` rather than separately stating “f is C^2 and Hessian continuous,” but this is equivalent/appropriate in this context.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `def RiemannIntegrableOn (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True` defines a predicate for Riemann integrability on [a,b], but sets it to True for all inputs. This is a vacuous placeholder: every function is “Riemann integrable” under this definition.
- `def riemannIntegral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0` defines the Riemann integral on [a,b] but sets it identically equal to 0 for all functions and intervals. Another vacuous placeholder.
- `theorem uniform_limit_of_riemann_integrables ...` states: given
  • `h_int : ∀ n, RiemannIntegrableOn (f_n n) a b`
  • `h_unif : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x, a ≤ x → x ≤ b → |f_n n x - f x| < ε` (this encodes uniform convergence on [a,b])
  then
  • `RiemannIntegrableOn f a b` and
  • `Tendsto (fun n => riemannIntegral (f_n n) a b) atTop (nhds (riemannIntegral f a b))`.
Because of the placeholders, the first conclusion is trivially True, and the second reduces to `Tendsto (fun _ => 0) atTop (nhds 0)`, which is trivially true as well. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The original statement: If each `f_n` is Riemann integrable on [a,b] and `f_n → f` uniformly on [a,b], then `f` is Riemann integrable and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n.

The code attempts to state this, using a topological Tendsto formulation for convergence of integrals, and an explicit ε–N uniform convergence on x ∈ [a,b]. However, the crucial predicates/objects (integrability and integral) are replaced by vacuous placeholders (`True` and `0`). Thus the statement proved in Lean is contentless and does not capture the real theorem.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Major discrepancy: integrability and integral are placeholders (vacuous and wrong). This violates faithful translation.
- Minor technicality: no assumption `a ≤ b`. In many frameworks the integral over [a,b] can be defined for any `a,b` (with orientation), but given the placeholders this is secondary.
- The uniform convergence is correctly encoded on [a,b] via the quantifiers.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation because it uses vacuous placeholder definitions for the key notions. If those placeholders were replaced by the real mathlib notions for Riemann integrability and the Riemann integral on [a,b], the theorem statement would match the natural language well. According to the rubric, this merits a grade where vacuous definitions are used but the final intended statement would be faithful once fixed.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Nat}`: We work in R^n, represented in mathlib as `Fin n → ℝ`.
- The theorem `convex_on_implies_convex_combination` is stated for:
  - `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)`: a subset U of R^n.
  - `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`: a real-valued function defined on the whole space (not just on U), but with differentiability and convexity assumptions restricted to U.
  - Hypotheses: `hU : IsOpen U` (U is open), `hd : DifferentiableOn ℝ f U` (f is differentiable on U), `hconv : ConvexOn ℝ U f` (f is convex on U, in mathlib's sense).
  - Conclusion: For all `x, y ∈ U` and all `t ∈ [0,1]`, we have the convexity inequality `f (t • x + (1 - t) • y) ≤ t * f x + (1 - t) * f y`.
  - Here `•` is scalar multiplication in the vector space `Fin n → ℝ`, so `t • x + (1 - t) • y` represents the convex combination of x and y. On the right-hand side, `*` is real multiplication (which coincides with scalar multiplication on ℝ), matching the standard convexity inequality.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let U ⊂ ℝ^n be open and f : U → ℝ differentiable. If f is convex on U, then for all x,y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], f(tx+(1−t)y) ≤ t f(x) + (1−t) f(y).
- The Lean statement matches this exactly, with a standard mathlib convention: f is defined on the ambient space but restricted assumptions on U via `DifferentiableOn` and `ConvexOn`. This is a mild, acceptable generalization and does not change the meaning.
- The additional assumptions `IsOpen U` and `DifferentiableOn` are present (as in the natural language), though not needed to derive the inequality from convexity; their presence is consistent with the original statement.
- `ConvexOn ℝ U f` in mathlib encodes precisely the inequality for convex combinations of points in U (and, depending on the exact definition, either includes or implies the needed convexity-in-U condition). Thus the conclusion stated is exactly the usual convexity inequality.

3) Final comparison and potential discrepancies:
- Domain of f: NL has `f : U → ℝ`, Lean has `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with properties restricted to U. This is a standard formalization pattern and does not change the content.
- All other aspects (openness, differentiability, convexity, inequality for all x,y in U and t ∈ [0,1]) align perfectly.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof, which is allowed per the auditing instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Faithfulness check:

- A literal reading of ""K is the union of finitely many open balls"" could suggest equality K = ⋃ balls, which is generally false unless K is open.

- There are no vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions; all concepts (MetricSpace, IsCompact, Metric.ball, Finset) are standard Mathlib components. No extraneous or misleading definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the intended mathematical statement (covering K by finitely many ε-balls for each ε > 0).

- Natural language: A convergent monotone sequence with limit equal to one of its terms `x_k` is eventually constant from `k` onward.
- Lean: Precisely that, with the following specifics: (a) the sequence is over `ℝ`; (b) monotone means nondecreasing (`Monotone` in Mathlib). Convergence is encoded by `Tendsto x atTop (nhds (x k))` which is exactly “lim x_n = x_k”. The conclusion `∀ n, k ≤ n → x n = x k` exactly matches “x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k”.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Specialization to reals: The Lean statement works over `ℝ`, while the natural language did not explicitly specify the codomain. This is a standard and acceptable specialization.
- Direction of monotonicity: The natural language says “monotone sequence,” which in some contexts can mean either nondecreasing or nonincreasing. The Lean code assumes nondecreasing (`Monotone`). This is a slight specialization but still faithful to one standard interpretation of “monotone.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions.

Overall, the translation is faithful up to slight specializations (reals and nondecreasing). It matches the mathematical meaning and intended conclusion.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- Docstring: States the setting: 𝕜 is a normed field; X and Y are complete normed 𝕜-vector spaces; A is a continuous linear map. If A is bijective, then its inverse is a bounded (continuous) linear map, i.e., there exists B : Y →L[𝕜] X which is the inverse of A.
- `theorem bounded_inverse_of_bijective ...`: Formally states the theorem with assumptions:
  - `𝕜` is a normed field.
  - `X, Y` are types with structures of normed additive commutative groups and normed 𝕜-vector spaces, and both are complete (Banach spaces).
  - `A : X →L[𝕜] Y` is a continuous (bounded) linear map.
  - `h : Function.Bijective (A.toLinearMap : X → Y)` assumes A is bijective as a linear map (equivalently one-to-one and onto as a function).
  - Conclusion: There exists `B : Y →L[𝕜] X` (a bounded/continuous linear map) such that `B ∘ A = id` on X and `A ∘ B = id` on Y, expressed as equations of linear maps. This exactly means B is the inverse of A in the category of continuous linear maps.
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but for our task we only check the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For normed vector spaces X, Y and a bounded linear operator A ∈ L(X,Y), if A is injective and surjective, then A^{-1}: Y → X is bounded. It suggests using the open mapping theorem (which requires completeness), or alternatively assuming completeness of X and Y for a proof.
- Lean theorem: Assumes X and Y are complete normed spaces over an arbitrary normed field 𝕜, A is a continuous (bounded) linear map, A is bijective, and concludes there exists a bounded linear map B serving as the inverse. This is precisely the Banach inverse mapping theorem statement and matches the natural language conclusion that A^{-1} is bounded.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Scalar field generality: Lean allows any normed field 𝕜, whereas the natural statement implicitly suggests ℝ or ℂ. This is a harmless generalization.
- Completeness: Lean explicitly assumes X and Y are complete (Banach), which aligns with the suggested approach via the open mapping theorem or the alternative assumption of completeness. The natural statement invites a proof under completeness; the Lean statement builds completeness into the hypotheses, which is consistent.
- Formulation: Lean produces a continuous linear inverse `B : Y →L[𝕜] X` with two-sided inverse properties as linear maps, exactly encoding that A^{-1} is bounded and is the inverse of A.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions: The code uses standard Mathlib structures (`→L[𝕜]`, `LinearMap`, completeness typeclasses) and introduces no fake placeholders.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a standard precise version) of the natural language claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem maximum_principle_harmonic {U : Set (ℝ × ℝ)} {f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ}`: We are stating a theorem about a set U in R^2 and a real-valued function f on R^2.
- `(hU : IsOpen U) (hconn : IsConnected U)`: U is assumed open and connected.
- `(hC2 : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U)`: f is C^2 on U.
- `(hlap : True)`: Placeholder hypothesis intended to represent that the Laplacian vanishes on U; but as written, it is literally the proposition True, i.e., imposes no condition at all.
- `{p : ℝ × ℝ} (hp : p ∈ U) (hmax : ∀ q ∈ U, f q ≤ f p)`: There exists a point p in U at which f attains a maximum over U (formalized as: for all q in U, f(q) ≤ f(p)).
- Conclusion: `∀ q ∈ U, f q = f p`: f is constant on U with value f(p).

2) Faithfulness to the natural-language statement:
- The natural statement requires: U ⊆ ℝ^2 is open and connected, f is harmonic (C^2 and f_xx + f_yy = 0 on U), and if f attains a maximum at p ∈ U then f is constant on U.
- The Lean code matches openness, connectedness, C^2 regularity, and the attainment of a maximum at p.
- Critical discrepancy: the harmonicity assumption is replaced by `hlap : True`, which is a vacuous placeholder and does not enforce f_xx + f_yy = 0 on U. Thus the theorem as stated in Lean claims the maximum principle for any C^2 function attaining a maximum on an open connected set, which is strictly stronger and not faithful to the harmonicity requirement.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced besides this placeholder; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per instructions, but the placeholder makes the statement itself incorrect relative to the intended meaning.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: domain ℝ^2 (as ℝ × ℝ), U open and connected, f C^2, maximum at p implies constancy.
- Different: harmonicity is missing; replaced by `True`.
- Therefore, the formal statement is not a faithful translation. If `hlap` were replaced by a proper hypothesis expressing vanishing Laplacian on U, it would be faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in ℝ^n, represented as `(Fin n → ℝ)`.
- `theorem differentiable_continuous_derivative_uniform_o_on_compacts ...`: States a theorem.
- `{U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} (hU : Convex ℝ U)`: U is a subset of ℝ^n that is convex.
- `{F : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)}`: F is a map from ℝ^n to ℝ^n.
- `(hF : ∀ x ∈ U, HasFDerivAt F (fderiv ℝ F x) x)`: For every x in U, F is Fréchet differentiable at x, and its derivative is `fderiv ℝ F x`.
- `(hcont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ F x) U)`: The derivative map `x ↦ fderiv ℝ F x` is continuous on U.
- Conclusion: `∀ K, IsCompact K → K ⊆ U → ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x ∈ K, ∀ h, ‖h‖ < δ → x + h ∈ U → ‖F (x + h) - F x - fderiv ℝ F x h‖ ≤ ε * ‖h‖`.
  This says: For every compact K contained in U and every ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for all x in K and all h with ‖h‖<δ and with x+h∈U, one has the estimate `‖F(x+h) - F(x) - DF(x) h‖ ≤ ε ‖h‖`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let F: ℝ^n → ℝ^n be differentiable and assume DF exists and is continuous on a convex set U. Show that `‖F(x+h) - F(x) - DF(x) h‖ = o(‖h‖)` uniformly on compact subsets of U as h→0.
- The Lean theorem assumes: differentiability at every x∈U (via `HasFDerivAt`), continuity of the derivative on U, and U is convex. It concludes a uniform small-o estimate on any compact K⊆U: for each ε, there is a δ working for all x∈K and all small h (with the technical requirement x+h∈U) giving the inequality `≤ ε‖h‖`. This is exactly the uniform little-o formulation.
- The requirement `x + h ∈ U` is a standard technical restriction when the differentiability/continuity assumptions are only guaranteed on U; it ensures the segment from x to x+h lies in U (helped by convexity), and is consistent with “uniform on compact subsets of U as h→0.” This does not change the mathematical content of the claim.
- Using `(Fin n → ℝ)` for ℝ^n, `HasFDerivAt`, `fderiv`, `ContinuousOn`, `Convex`, `IsCompact`, and the norm are all standard Mathlib notions; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement precisely formalizes the uniform little-o estimate on compact subsets of U under the given hypotheses. The explicit `x+h ∈ U` condition is a harmless and natural technical detail given the domain of assumptions, and matches the intended meaning of “as h→0” within U. There are no extraneous or missing assumptions that change the mathematical meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `differentiable_at_of_deriv_tendsto` is stated over the real numbers with parameters `a b c L : ℝ` and hypotheses:
  - `hab : a < b` ensures the interval `(a,b)` is nonempty.
  - `hc : c ∈ Ioo a b` says the point `c` lies in the open interval `(a,b)`.
  - `f : ℝ → ℝ` is a real-valued function (total on ℝ, but all hypotheses restrict to `(a,b)`).
  - `hcont : ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b)` says `f` is continuous on the open interval `(a,b)`.
  - `hdiff : ∀ x ∈ (Ioo a b \ {c}), DifferentiableAt ℝ f x` says `f` is differentiable at every point of `(a,b)` except possibly at `c`.
  - `hlim : Filter.Tendsto (fun x => deriv f x) (nhdsWithin c (Ioo a b \ {c})) (nhds L)` says the derivative `f'` tends to `L` as `x → c` within `(a,b)` with `x ≠ c`. This matches the usual meaning of `lim_{x→c} f'(x) = L` restricted to the domain `(a,b)`.
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableAt ℝ f c ∧ deriv f c = L`, i.e., `f` is differentiable at `c` and its derivative there equals `L`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- NL: `f : (a,b) → ℝ` continuous and differentiable on `(a,b) \ {c}`, and `lim_{x→c} f'(x) = L` exists. Conclude `f` is differentiable at `c` and `f'(c) = L`.
- Lean: Models `f` as a function on ℝ, with continuity on `(a,b)` and differentiability on `(a,b) \ {c}`. The limit is taken along `nhdsWithin c (Ioo a b \ {c})`, which exactly matches the two-sided limit within `(a,b)` excluding `c`. The conclusion matches precisely.

3) Final comparison:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only mild formalization difference is that `f` is a total function ℝ → ℝ with properties restricted to the set `(a,b)`, which is standard and faithful.
- The continuity assumption `ContinuousOn f (Ioo a b)` matches “`f` is continuous on (a,b)”. Everything else aligns.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The theorem `compact_exists_finite_epsilon_net {X : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace X] {K : Set X} (hK : IsCompact K)` states: For a type X equipped with a pseudometric space structure, and a subset K of X that is compact, we have the following.
- `∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ s : Finset X, K ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ s, Metric.ball x ε`: For every ε > 0, there exists a finite set s of points in X such that K is contained in the union of the open ε-balls centered at the points of s.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: In a metric space (X, d), if K ⊆ X is compact, then for every ε > 0 there exists a finite ε-net for K. A finite ε-net is a finite subset S of X such that K ⊆ ⋃_{x ∈ S} B(x, ε).
- The Lean statement exactly captures this: existence of a finite set s (a Finset) whose ε-balls cover K.
- Minor differences:
  - The Lean code assumes a PseudoMetricSpace instead of a MetricSpace. This is a slight generalization and acceptable under the guidelines.
  - The centers of the ε-balls are allowed to be anywhere in X (not necessarily in K). The natural statement does not require centers in K, so this matches standard usage of ε-net.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement itself directly formalizes the claim.

Final check: The mathematical content matches the original statement (up to a harmless generalization from metric to pseudometric). Therefore the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem is stated for any natural number n, modeling ℝ^n as Fin n → ℝ.
- mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is an arbitrary set function on all subsets of ℝ^n.
- mstar_nonneg: for every set s, 0 ≤ mstar s (nonnegativity).
- mstar_mono: if s ⊆ t, then mstar s ≤ mstar t (monotonicity).
- X : Set (Fin n → ℝ) is the given subset.
- h: For every ε > 0, there exists a set Y with X ⊆ Y and mstar Y ≤ ε.
- Conclusion: mstar X = 0.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: For X ⊆ ℝ^n, if for every ε > 0 there exists Y ⊇ X with m*(Y) ≤ ε (m* is an outer measure on ℝ^n), then m*(X) = 0.
- The code matches the quantifiers and the inclusion relation (X ⊆ Y vs Y ⊇ X are equivalent).
- It parameterizes m* as any nonnegative, monotone set function, which is a slight generalization of an outer measure but sufficient for the argument and fully compatible with the statement (outer measures satisfy these properties). The generalization is acceptable and does not change the meaning of the conclusion.
- Domain ℝ^n is represented as Fin n → ℝ, standard in mathlib, matching the intended space.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions; assumptions are legitimate and minimal for the conclusion.
- The conclusion mstar X = 0 matches m*(X) = 0.
- The code does not introduce extraneous restrictions or omit necessary conditions.
- The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions, as we only check the statement’s faithfulness.

Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully captures the natural language statement (indeed, in a slightly more general form that remains correct).

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- Context: S : Set ℝ, c, L, M, a : ℝ, f g : ℝ → ℝ. We work with filters (open Filter).
- hc : c ∈ closure (S \ {c}) asserts that c is a cluster (accumulation) point of S.
- hf : Tendsto f (nhdsWithin c S) (nhds L) means f(x) → L as x → c with x restricted to S.
- hg : Tendsto g (nhdsWithin c S) (nhds M) means g(x) → M as x → c with x restricted to S.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The mathematical content matches: the code formalizes the limit along S (via nhdsWithin), the cluster point condition (via closure (S \ {c})), and concludes that scaling by a constant preserves the limit.
- The code includes g and its limit M as a hypothesis, which the conclusion does not use. This mirrors the natural-language setup (which mentions g and M) and does not affect the correctness of the stated conclusion.
- The only minor technical difference is that the code takes f, g : ℝ → ℝ instead of f, g : S → ℝ, but the use of nhdsWithin c S precisely captures limits along S and is a standard, slightly more general formalization. This is acceptable and faithful.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain of f, g: S → ℝ in prose vs ℝ → ℝ in code with nhdsWithin. This is a harmless generalization and faithfully represents “limit along S.”
- Extra hypotheses (g, M, and the cluster point condition) are present in both the prose and the code; even if unused for the conclusion, they do not create a mismatch.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {x lam : ℕ → ℝ}`: We have two real sequences x(n) and lam(n), indexed by natural numbers (starting at 0).
- The theorem `jirilebl_ra_ch_seq_ser_4414` assumes:
  - `h_bound`: There exists a real constant C such that for every n, the absolute value of the partial sum of x from i = 0 to i = n is at most C; formally, |∑_{i=0}^n x_i| ≤ C. In Lean this is `abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) (fun i => x i)) ≤ C`.
  - `h_lam`: `lam` tends to 0 as n → ∞; i.e., lim lam_n = 0.
  - `h_diff`: The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ |lam_{n+1} − lam_n| is summable (convergent).
- Conclusion: `Summable fun n => lam n * x n`, i.e., the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ lam_n x_n converges.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let ∑_{n=1}^∞ x_n be a series with bounded partial sums, and let {λ_n} satisfy lim λ_n = 0 and ∑_{n=1}^∞ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges. Show ∑_{n=1}^∞ λ_n x_n converges.
- The Lean version uses indices starting at 0 instead of 1 for both the partial sums and the target series; this is a harmless indexing shift. Boundedness of partial sums from 1 to N is equivalent to boundedness from 0 to N up to adding/subtracting the single term x_0, which does not affect boundedness. Similarly, summability/convergence of ∑_{n=1}^∞ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| is equivalent to that of ∑_{n=0}^∞, since adding/removing finitely many terms does not affect convergence. The limit lam_n → 0 is stated identically. The conclusion ∑ lam_n x_n converges matches the intended result, again up to the 0/1 indexing shift, which is immaterial for convergence.
- The codomain is ℝ (real numbers), which is a reasonable specialization of the typical context; the natural statement did not specify a more general field, so this is acceptable.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all hypotheses are meaningful Mathlib notions (bounded partial sums expressed explicitly, Tendsto to 0, Summable, etc.). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the task, since we are auditing the formulation, not the proof.

3) Final comparison:

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- Comment: ""/-- Two outer measures on R^n: m_star and mu_star (definitions omitted). -/"" — This indicates the intended meaning, but no actual definitions are provided.
- `theorem mu_star_eq_m_star {n : ℕ} (m_star mu_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : mu_star S = m_star S := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n, for any two functions m_star and mu_star from subsets of R^n (encoded as Fin n → ℝ) to ℝ, and for any set S, we have mu_star(S) = m_star(S). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does this match the original statement?
- The original statement defines two specific set functions m^* and μ^* on ℝ^n using infima over coverings by open rectangles (countable vs finite/countable), and claims that for every S, μ^*(S) = m^*(S).
- The Lean code does not define m_star or mu_star at all, nor does it encode anything about coverings by open rectangles, countability, or outer measures.
- Worse, the theorem as stated claims equality for arbitrary functions m_star and mu_star with no hypotheses, which is not only unrelated to the specific definitions but also false in general.
- The presence of `sorry` indicates no proof, but more importantly, the statement itself is not the intended one.

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are different. The natural language statement is a specific equality between two explicitly defined outer measures. The Lean theorem asserts equality for arbitrary functions from sets to reals without any structure or definition tying them to the intended constructions. It omits all crucial definitions and conditions, and its statement is overly general and incorrect.
- Additional discrepancies:
  - No definitions of open rectangles, coverings, or infima are provided.
  - No restriction to outer measures; mere arbitrary set functions.
  - The theorem incorrectly quantifies over arbitrary m_star and mu_star.
  - Uses `sorry` for the proof and provides no auxiliary faithful definitions.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedAddCommGroup Y] [NormedSpace ℝ X] [NormedSpace ℝ Y]`
  This sets X and Y to be real normed vector spaces (normed additive commutative groups with an ℝ-vector space structure).

- `theorem opNorm_add_le (A B : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖A + B‖ ≤ ‖A‖ + ‖B‖ := by sorry`
  For bounded (continuous) linear maps A, B : X → Y, the operator norm satisfies the triangle inequality: ‖A + B‖ ≤ ‖A‖ + ‖B‖. The expression `A + B` is itself of type `X →L[ℝ] Y`, so this also implicitly uses that the sum of bounded linear maps is a bounded linear map.

- `theorem opNorm_smul (c : ℝ) (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖c • A‖ = |c| * ‖A‖ := by sorry`
  For c ∈ ℝ and a bounded linear map A, the operator norm scales: ‖c • A‖ = |c| ‖A‖. Again, `c • A` is a bounded linear map by typing, so this also implies scalar multiples are bounded.

- `theorem opNorm_nonneg (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : 0 ≤ ‖A‖ := by sorry`
  Operator norm is nonnegative.

- `theorem opNorm_eq_zero_iff (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖A‖ = 0 ↔ A = 0 := by sorry`
  Operator norm is definite: ‖A‖ = 0 iff A is the zero operator.

- `theorem operator_norm_is_norm : ... := by sorry`
  Collects the norm axioms on L(X,Y): nonnegativity, definiteness, triangle inequality, and absolute homogeneity.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: (1) If A, B are linear and bounded then A + B is bounded. (2) If α ∈ ℝ then αA is bounded. (3) The operator norm is a norm on L(X,Y).
- In Lean, bounded linear maps are represented by `X →L[ℝ] Y`. The theorems are stated for such A, B and c ∈ ℝ, and the expressions `A + B` and `c • A` are of the same type, demonstrating closure (boundedness) under addition and scalar multiplication. Moreover, the code proves the stronger norm inequalities/equalities, which imply boundedness.
- The final theorem explicitly states the norm axioms on `X →L[ℝ] Y`, i.e., that ‖·‖ on L(X,Y) is a norm.

Final check for discrepancies:
- Scalars are over ℝ, matching the natural language (α ∈ ℝ). No extra or missing hypotheses.
- The code does not introduce vacuous definitions; it uses Mathlib’s standard `ContinuousLinearMap` (`→L[ℝ]`) and norm.
- The presence of `sorry` only omits proofs; the statements themselves are exactly the intended mathematical claims and, if anything, slightly stronger (norm inequalities) than merely asserting boundedness.

Conclusion: The code faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The definition `integral_op (k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (y : ℝ) : ℝ := MeasureTheory.integral (MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume (α := ℝ)) fun x => k (x, y) * f x` says: Given a kernel k on ℝ × ℝ, a function f : ℝ → ℝ, and a parameter y ∈ ℝ, define (integral_op k f) y to be the Lebesgue integral over the entire real line of x ↦ k(x, y) f(x) with respect to Lebesgue measure on ℝ.
- The theorem `integral_op_maps_continuous (k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ) (hk : Continuous k) : ∀ f : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous f → Continuous (fun y => integral_op k f y)` asserts: If k is continuous on ℝ × ℝ, then for any continuous f : ℝ → ℝ, the function y ↦ ∫(over ℝ) k(x,y) f(x) dx is continuous on ℝ. Proof omitted via sorry.
- The theorem `integral_op_linear ...` asserts linearity in f and g: For all f, g : ℝ → ℝ and scalars a, b, the function y ↦ integral_op k (a f + b g) y equals y ↦ a * integral_op k f y + b * integral_op k g y, i.e., linearity of the operator in the input function, again over the integral on ℝ.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original statement: k : [0,1]^2 → ℝ continuous; L : C([0,1], ℝ) → C([0,1], ℝ) defined by (Lf)(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x, y) f(x) dx. Show L is well-defined (Lf is continuous on [0,1] when f is) and linear.
- Lean code differences:
  - Domain of integration: The code integrates over the entire real line ℝ using Lebesgue measure, not over the interval [0,1]. There is no restriction to [0,1] or use of a restricted measure. This is a substantive change, not just a harmless generalization.
  - Domains of k and f: The code assumes k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ and f : ℝ → ℝ, rather than k defined on [0,1]^2 and f on [0,1]. There is no restriction of y to [0,1] either; the resulting function is on ℝ, not on [0,1].
  - Target space: The original map is L : C([0,1], ℝ) → C([0,1], ℝ). The code does not use the type of continuous maps on [0,1]; it phrases continuity as a predicate on functions ℝ → ℝ and outputs a function ℝ → ℝ. Thus, it does not define an operator between the intended function spaces.
  - Well-definedness: The code claims continuity of y ↦ ∫ℝ k(x,y) f(x) dx for continuous k and f on ℝ, which is generally false without integrability/dominating conditions. More importantly for faithfulness, the original requires continuity on [0,1] under integration over [0,1], which is not what is stated.
  - Linearity: While the code states a linearity identity, it is for integration over ℝ and for functions ℝ → ℝ, not for [0,1] and not within the C([0,1]) framework.

Final check: The mathematical problems are different. The Lean code changes the domain and measure from [0,1] to ℝ, does not encode the operator between C([0,1], ℝ) spaces, and asserts continuity on ℝ rather than on [0,1]. No vacuous definitions are made (the definitions use actual mathlib constructions), but the translation is not faithful to the original statement.

- Theorem integral_zero_implies_zero_outside_measure_zero:
  - Context: n : ℕ, ambient space is Fin n → ℝ (i.e., ℝ^n). R : Set (Fin n → ℝ) is assumed to be a closed rectangle (h_rect : is_closed_rectangle R). f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is a function on ℝ^n, nonnegative on R (h_nonneg), Riemann integrable on R (h_int), and its integral on R is zero (h_zero).
  - Conclusion: There exists a set E : Set (Fin n → ℝ) with outer_measure_zero E and such that ∀ x ∈ R \ E, f x = 0.
  - Proof: by sorry (omitted).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement:
- Let R ⊂ ℝ^n be a closed rectangle.
- f : R → ℝ is Riemann integrable and f(x) ≥ 0 on R.
- If ∫_R f = 0, then there exists E ⊂ R of outer measure zero such that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R \ E.

How the code matches:
- Domain/space: The code uses Fin n → ℝ for ℝ^n. That is fine.
- Function and integrability: The code takes f : ℝ^n → ℝ and a predicate Riemann_integrable_on f R. This is a standard way to encode “f is Riemann integrable on R” even though the natural language said f : R → ℝ. This is acceptable as a formalization choice.
- Nonnegativity: Encoded as ∀ x ∈ R, 0 ≤ f x. Matches.
- Zero integral: Encoded as integral_on f R = 0. Matches in spirit.
- Conclusion: The code states ∃ E ⊂ ℝ^n with outer_measure_zero E and f = 0 on R \ E. The natural language requires E ⊂ R in addition to having outer measure zero (in ℝ^n).

Step 3: Faithfulness assessment and discrepancies
- Major issue: All key notions (Riemann integrable on, integral, closed rectangle, outer measure zero) are introduced as axioms/placeholders with no content. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.
- Additional mismatch: The code does not require E ⊆ R, while the natural language explicitly requires E ⊂ R. In a correct measure-theoretic setting this can be fixed by replacing E with E ∩ R, but since outer_measure_zero is an unconstrained predicate here, the code’s statement is strictly weaker and not equivalent to the original.
- Otherwise, the logical form (nonnegativity + zero integral implies f = 0 outside a null set) is captured.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It relies on vacuous axioms instead of Mathlib definitions, and it misses the requirement E ⊆ R in the conclusion.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The context sets E to be a finite-dimensional real normed vector space: [NormedAddCommGroup E], [NormedSpace ℝ E], [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]. This generalizes ℝ^n.
- f : E → ℝ, U : Set E. Assumptions: hU : IsOpen U (U is open), convU : Convex ℝ U (U is convex), hcont : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (f is C^2 on U; i.e., twice continuously differentiable on U).
- The theorem states: For every compact K ⊆ U and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ ≠ 0 and ‖h‖ < δ, we have x + h ∈ U and
  | f (x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
- Here, fderiv ℝ f x : E →L[ℝ] ℝ is the Fréchet derivative at x, which in ℝ^n corresponds to the dot product with ∇f(x). The term fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the derivative of the derivative, i.e., the bilinear second derivative (the Hessian viewed as a symmetric bilinear map); applying it as ((...) h) h computes hᵀ H_f(x) h.
- The inequality is uniform in x ∈ K because δ depends only on K and ε, not on x.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable and H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Conclude that f(x+h) = f(x) + ∇f(x)·h + 1/2 hᵀ H_f(x) h + o(‖h‖^2) as h → 0 uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean statement is in a slightly more general setting (finite-dimensional real normed space E rather than ℝ^n) and assumes U is open and convex, and f is C^2 on U (ContDiffOn ℝ 2), which is the standard formalization of “Hessian continuous” in Mathlib. This is a standard, faithful strengthening.
- The conclusion in Lean is an ε–δ estimate yielding |remainder| ≤ ε‖h‖^2 for small ‖h‖, uniformly in x ∈ K, which is precisely the uniform little-o(‖h‖^2) statement on compact subsets.
- The technical side condition x + h ∈ U is natural and ensures evaluations make sense; it’s consistent with working on compact K ⊆ U and choosing δ small enough. The condition ‖h‖ ≠ 0 is harmless (at h = 0 the inequality holds trivially), and aligns with little-o estimates.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain generalization: E finite-dimensional vs ℝ^n. Acceptable strengthening.
- Openness of U: The natural statement doesn’t explicitly require U open, but the formalization does. This is a mild strengthening often implicit when discussing differentiability and Taylor’s theorem; it does not change the intended meaning on compact subsets of U.
- Regularity assumption: “differentiable with continuous Hessian” vs ContDiffOn ℝ 2. In Euclidean/finite-dimensional settings, these are essentially equivalent assumptions for Taylor’s theorem and the Hessian notion; no issue.
- Form of conclusion: ε–δ inequality vs little-o; they are equivalent definitions of o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact sets.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions are standard Mathlib (ContDiffOn, fderiv, IsCompact, Convex, etc.). The theorem is a faithful and slightly more general/formal version of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language theorem, with standard formal refinements.

- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type n is finite with decidable equality, so `Matrix n n R` are square matrices of size |n| over R, and determinant is defined.

The Lean theorem states exactly this equality for square matrices over a commutative ring, which is the standard setting for determinants. The hint about proof strategy is not part of the formal statement, so its absence is fine.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is a single theorem statement.
- The only specialization is assuming `R` is a `CommRing`, while the natural language did not specify the scalar ring; determinants are typically considered over commutative rings (or fields), so this is a standard and acceptable context. This is a slight explicit assumption rather than a mismatch.
- Therefore, the Lean code faithfully states the intended theorem.

3) Final check for differences:

The natural language statement explicitly includes the polynomial case and then notes a more general version. Specializing to the polynomial case is acceptable as a faithful formalization of that part.
- All other details (domain, inequalities, and conditions) match exactly. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the instructions since we are checking the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the polynomial portion of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We work over a commutative ring R.
- `variable {n : Type _} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: The index type n is finite and has decidable equality; matrices are n-by-n.

Definitions:
- `def swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix n n R := (Matrix.reindex (Equiv.refl n) (Equiv.swap j k)).toFun A`
  This defines the matrix obtained from A by swapping columns j and k. It uses reindexing with identity on rows and the transposition (swap) on columns.
- `def swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) (i j : n) : Matrix n n R := (Matrix.reindex (Equiv.swap i j) (Equiv.refl n)).toFun A`
  This defines the matrix obtained from A by swapping rows i and j, using the transposition on rows and identity on columns.

Theorems:
- `theorem det_swap_cols {A : Matrix n n R} {j k : n} (hj : j ≠ k) : Matrix.det (swap_cols A j k) = - Matrix.det A`
  If j ≠ k, then the determinant changes sign when swapping columns j and k.
- `theorem det_swap_rows {A : Matrix n n R} {i j : n} (hi : i ≠ j) : Matrix.det (swap_rows A i j) = - Matrix.det A`
  If i ≠ j, then the determinant changes sign when swapping rows i and j.
- `theorem det_eq_zero_of_row_eq {A : Matrix n n R} {i j : n} (hi : i ≠ j) (h : Matrix.row A i = Matrix.row A j) : Matrix.det A = 0`
  If two distinct rows i and j are equal as row vectors, then det A = 0.
- `theorem det_eq_zero_of_col_eq {A : Matrix n n R} {i j : n} (hi : i ≠ j) (h : Matrix.col A i = Matrix.col A j) : Matrix.det A = 0`
  If two distinct columns i and j are equal as column vectors, then det A = 0.

All auxiliary definitions (swap_cols, swap_rows) use standard Mathlib constructions (Matrix.reindex with Equiv.swap) and are legitimate, not vacuous.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language asks to show: swapping columns j and k negates the determinant; swapping rows j and k negates the determinant; if a matrix has two equal rows or two equal columns then its determinant is zero. The Lean statements match these exactly. The requirement j ≠ k is explicitly included in the Lean theorems; this is implicitly understood in the natural language by the word ""switching"" (swapping the same index would do nothing and not negate the determinant), so this is a faithful formalization.
- The setting is slightly more general (any commutative ring rather than a specific field), which is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- The instruction to avoid Laplace expansion concerns proof methods; since we are auditing the statement/translation (and proofs are omitted with `sorry`), this is not a mismatch.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- No vacuous placeholders; all terms are from Mathlib.
- The content aligns perfectly. The only explicit technical additions are the distinctness hypotheses (i ≠ j), which are implicit in the natural description of swapping, and the generality over a commutative ring, which is a harmless and standard generalization.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but the rest of the code does not actually use Mathlib's Riemann integration notions.
- The theorem declares parameters a, b : ℝ, f : ℝ → ℝ; then introduces a number of entirely abstract parameters:
  - Partition : Type — an arbitrary type, not specified to be the type of partitions of [a,b].
  - upper_sum : Partition → (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ and lower_sum : Partition → (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ — arbitrary functions; not tied to upper and lower sums along partitions in Mathlib.
  - RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop — an arbitrary predicate; not Mathlib’s notion of Riemann integrability on [a,b].
  - integral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ — an arbitrary function; not Mathlib’s Riemann integral over [a,b].
- h_bounded: ∃ M, ∀ x, a ≤ x → x ≤ b → |f x| ≤ M — expresses boundedness of f on [a,b]. This matches the natural-language boundedness assumption.
- P : ℕ → Partition — a sequence in this arbitrary Partition type, purportedly partitions, but with no link to [a,b] or any partition axioms.
- h_diff_to_zero: ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ k ≥ N, |upper_sum (P k) f - lower_sum (P k) f| < ε — the gap between the two arbitrary functions along the sequence tends to 0. Intended to reflect U(P_k,f) - L(P_k,f) → 0.
- Conclusion: RiemannIntegrableOn f a b ∧ (upper_sum (P k) f → integral f a b) ∧ (lower_sum (P k) f → integral f a b) in ε-δ terms. This asserts integrability and that both ""upper_sum"" and ""lower_sum"" limits equal the ""integral"".
- The proof is by sorry, but we are judging only the statement and definitions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural statement: For a bounded f on [a,b], if there exists a sequence of partitions P_k of [a,b] with U(P_k,f) - L(P_k,f) → 0, then f is Riemann integrable and ∫_a^b f = lim U(P_k,f) = lim L(P_k,f).
- Intended alignment: The code tries to express the same high-level theorem: boundedness on [a,b], existence of a partition sequence with upper-lower sums gap → 0, then integrability and equality of limits to the integral.

Step 3: Faithfulness check and discrepancies
Major issues (red flags per guidelines):
- All core mathematical notions are replaced by arbitrary parameters not connected to Mathlib or any definitions:
  - Partition is an arbitrary type, not the type of partitions of [a,b]. No condition that P k are partitions of [a,b].
  - upper_sum and lower_sum are arbitrary functions with no relation to upper and lower Riemann sums.
  - RiemannIntegrableOn and integral are arbitrary; not Mathlib’s definitions.
- Because these are unconstrained placeholders, the theorem statement is not a faithful formalization of the natural statement. It asserts a result for any such structures satisfying only the one convergence hypothesis, which is not the same as the Riemann integration context.
- Missing standard conditions: no a ≤ b; no requirement that the ""partitions"" actually partition [a,b]; no link between f|_[a,b] and the sums.
- While the epsilon-limit formulations for convergence are fine in spirit, they are applied to arbitrary upper_sum/lower_sum functions, not the canonical U(P,f), L(P,f).

Conclusion: The code does not faithfully translate the natural language theorem. It relies on vacuous/abstract placeholders rather than Mathlib’s notions, so it fails the legitimacy requirement for auxiliary definitions. If these placeholders were replaced by appropriate Mathlib definitions (partitions of [a,b], upper/lower sums, Riemann integrability, and integral) and the condition that P_k are partitions of [a,b], then the final theorem statement would match the natural language statement.

Grade rationale: Vacuous placeholders are used, but if fixed, the final theorem would be faithful. Hence a mid-level score.

  Hypotheses:

  • hg_cont : Continuous g means g is continuous on ℝ.
  • hg_zero : ∀ t, t < a ∨ t > b → g t = 0 means g vanishes outside the closed interval [a,b].
  Conclusion:
  • For every x ∈ ℝ, the function t ↦ f(t) * g(x − t) is Lebesgue integrable; hence the integral defining the convolution exists (is well-defined).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Original: f is a Riemann integrable function with ∫ |f| < ∞; g is continuous and equals 0 outside [a,b]; show the convolution (g * f)(x) = ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt is well-defined for all x.
- Lean: Assumes f is Lebesgue integrable (Integrable f), g continuous, g = 0 outside [a,b], and concludes that for every x, the integrand is integrable, i.e., the convolution integral is well-defined.
- This matches the intended result: existence (well-definedness) of the integral for all x.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean hypothesis uses Lebesgue integrable f rather than explicitly Riemann integrable with absolutely convergent improper integral. This is a slight generalization: absolute Riemann integrability implies Lebesgue integrability, and the conclusion remains the same. This is acceptable per the guidelines.
- The condition “g equals zero outside [a,b]” is correctly encoded as g t = 0 whenever t < a or t > b.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; there are no auxiliary definitions; only the theorem statement is given (proof omitted, which is allowed).

Conclusion: The code faithfully formalizes the statement (modulo a standard generalization from Riemann to Lebesgue integrability).

",5,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work over an index type n with Fintype and DecidableEq, and over a commutative ring R. Matrices are Matrix n n R.
- Theorem `matrix_adjugate_mul (A : Matrix n n R) : A * Matrix.adjugate A = Matrix.det A • 1`:
  This states the classical identity A · adj(A) = det(A) · I (I is the identity matrix). Here Matrix.adjugate is the classical adjugate (transpose of the cofactor matrix), det is the determinant, and • denotes scalar multiplication of a matrix by a scalar.
- Theorem `adjugate_transpose_inverse_of_det_unit {A} (h : IsUnit (Matrix.det A)) : (...)`:
  Assuming det(A) is a unit, the statement asserts that the matrix ((unit inverse of det(A)) • (adj(A))^T) is both a left and right inverse of A^T. Equivalently, (A^T)^{-1} = (det(A))^{-1} · (adj(A))^T. Since (adj(A))^T is the cofactor matrix B, this is exactly the familiar formula (A^T)^{-1} = (1/det A) · B when det(A) is invertible.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language has two parts:
  (i) Define S by S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j} and show that A S A^T is a diagonal matrix.
  (ii) If A is invertible then (A^T)^{-1} = (1/det(A)) B, where B is the cofactor matrix; hint: use Laplace formula.
- The Lean code does not mention or define S at all, nor does it assert anything about A S A^T being diagonal. So the first requested result is missing entirely.
- The second part is captured faithfully: the code proves (under the natural and equivalent assumption that det(A) is a unit) that (A^T)^{-1} equals (det(A))^{-1} times (adj(A))^T, i.e., (1/det A) · B, since B is by definition the cofactor matrix and adj(A) is its transpose. Presenting it as a two-sided inverse is a standard algebraic formalization of the inverse formula.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- No. The Lean code includes the classical adjugate identity and the inverse formula for A^T, but it does not address or encode the first statement about A S A^T being diagonal with S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j}. There is no S in the code, and no diagonal claim. The second part matches; the first part is absent.

Other notes:
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all constants and notions are standard Mathlib. Proofs are omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for this audit.
- The assumption IsUnit (det A) is the correct algebraic analogue of “A is invertible” over a commutative ring.

Conclusion: Part (ii) is faithfully translated; part (i) is missing. Overall, the translation is not faithful to the full natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_riemann_626 {a b : Real} {f : Real → Real}` introduces real numbers a, b and a real-valued function f.
- `(RiemannIntegrableOn : (Real → Real) → Real → Real → Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate symbol meant to represent “f is Riemann integrable on [a,b]”, but it is just a parameter with no properties.
- `(Riemann_integral : (Real → Real) → Real → Real → Real)` introduces an arbitrary function symbol intended to represent the Riemann integral of f over [a,b]. Again, just a parameter.
- `(Riemann_sum : (Real → Real) → List Real → List Real → Real)` introduces an arbitrary function symbol intended to represent the Riemann sum given a list P (meant to be a partition) and a list cs (meant to be sample points). Also just a parameter.
- `(h_int : RiemannIntegrableOn f a b)` assumes that f is integrable in the sense of the arbitrary predicate.
- `{ε : Real} (hε : ε > 0)` fixes ε > 0.
- Conclusion: `∃ P : List Real, ∀ cs : List Real, cs.length = P.length.pred → abs (Riemann_integral f a b - Riemann_sum f P cs) < ε` states there exists a list P such that for all lists cs of length one less than P’s length, the absolute difference between the arbitrary “integral” and arbitrary “Riemann_sum” is < ε.
- The proof is `by sorry` (omitted), but that does not affect the statement auditing.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural statement: f : [a,b] → ℝ is Riemann integrable. For any ε > 0 there exists a partition P = {x_0,...,x_n} of [a,b] such that for every choice of sample points c_k ∈ [x_{k−1},x_k], the Riemann sum ∑ f(c_k) Δx_k approximates the integral within ε.
- Discrepancies:
  • The code replaces standard Mathlib notions (Riemann integrable on [a,b], the integral, and Riemann sums) with completely arbitrary parameters with no axioms. This is vacuous and not faithful to the intended mathematical content.
  • The code’s P is just `List Real`, with no constraints that it is a partition of [a,b] (sorted, with endpoints a and b, nonempty subintervals, etc.).
  • The code’s quantification over cs imposes only a length condition `cs.length = P.length.pred`; it does not enforce that each c_k lies in its corresponding subinterval [x_{k−1}, x_k].
  • The expression for the Riemann sum is a black-box `Riemann_sum f P cs`, not the concrete ∑ f(c_k) Δx_k.
- Therefore, the formal statement is not a faithful formalization of the given theorem.

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical problems are different. The Lean statement is an abstract claim about arbitrary symbols and unconstrained lists; it does not enforce the core structural conditions of partitions and sample points or the standard definitions of Riemann integrability, integral, or Riemann sums. Even if one swapped in genuine Mathlib definitions for the three parameters, the theorem still fails to assert P is a partition of [a,b] and c_k ∈ [x_{k−1}, x_k]. Hence it is not faithful.

Given these issues, the translation fails by the rubric: it uses vacuous placeholders and omits essential constraints; even if those placeholders were replaced, the final statement remains incorrect due to missing partition/sample-point conditions.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context sets E and F as normed real vector spaces: [NormedAddCommGroup E], [NormedSpace ℝ E], and similarly for F.
- L : E ≃L[ℝ] F means L is a continuous linear equivalence (a bounded linear operator with a bounded inverse). Its inverse is L.symm : F →L[ℝ] E.
- A : E →L[ℝ] F is a bounded (continuous) linear operator.
- The hypothesis h: ‖A - (L : E →L[ℝ] F)‖ < 1 / ‖(L.symm : F →L[ℝ] E)‖ requires A to be within distance 1/‖L⁻¹‖ of L in operator norm.
- Conclusion: There exists e : E ≃L[ℝ] F such that e.toContinuousLinearMap = A (so A is invertible as a continuous linear equivalence) and the norm of its inverse satisfies
  ‖(e.symm).toContinuousLinearMap‖ ≤ ‖L.symm‖ / (1 - ‖L.symm‖ * ‖A - L‖),
  which matches the stated Neumann-series bound.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let L be a linear operator between normed vector spaces, invertible with bounded inverse. Then there exists δ > 0 such that if ‖A - L‖ < δ, then A is invertible and ‖A⁻¹‖ ≤ ‖L⁻¹‖/(1 - ‖L⁻¹‖‖A - L‖).
- The Lean theorem encodes precisely the standard Neumann perturbation result for bounded linear operators: it assumes L is a continuous linear equivalence (hence linear, invertible, and both L and L⁻¹ are bounded), and for any A with ‖A - L‖ < 1/‖L⁻¹‖ it concludes A is invertible with the same quantitative bound on the inverse norm. This is exactly the content of the natural statement with the explicit choice δ = 1/‖L⁻¹‖.

Notes on potential differences:
- Field: Lean specializes to ℝ, while the natural statement does not specify (it often holds over ℝ or ℂ). This is a benign specialization per the guidelines.
- Existence of δ vs explicit hypothesis: The code uses the explicit threshold 1/‖L⁻¹‖ in the hypothesis instead of existentially quantifying δ > 0. This is an equivalent, standard formulation.
- No vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement uses Mathlib's standard types (continuous linear maps and equivalences). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but per the task we only judge the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We work in a real normed vector space E (a NormedAddCommGroup with a NormedSpace ℝ E structure). The function is f : E → ℝ, the point is x0 : E, and the derivative at x0 is a continuous linear map f' : E →L[ℝ] ℝ.
- Hypothesis hf : HasFDerivAt f f' x0 means f is Fréchet-differentiable at x0 with derivative f'.
- The theorem asserts: For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all h : E with ‖h‖ < δ, we have |f (x0 + h) − f x0 − f' h| ≤ (‖f'‖ + ε) * ‖h‖.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: for f : ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable at x0, show |f(x0+h) − f(x0) − Df(x0) h| ≤ ‖Df(x0)‖ ‖h‖ + o(‖h‖) as h → 0.
- The Lean statement is a standard quantifier form of the little-o bound with an explicit ‖f'‖ term: for every ε > 0, for small h, |error| ≤ (‖f'‖ + ε)‖h‖, i.e., |error| ≤ ‖f'‖‖h‖ + ε‖h‖. This exactly matches the little-o formulation “≤ ‖f'‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖)”.
- The Lean code generalizes the domain from ℝ^n to an arbitrary real normed vector space E. This is a benign (standard) generalization and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the only item is a theorem statement (with an unfilled proof), which is allowed.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. Both assert that, under differentiability at x0, the Taylor remainder is bounded by ‖Df(x0)‖‖h‖ plus a term that is o(‖h‖). The Lean statement uses the equivalent ε–δ form with (‖f'‖ + ε)‖h‖ on the right-hand side.
- The only difference is the generality of the domain (E vs ℝ^n), which is an acceptable generalization.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language claim.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [MetricSpace X]`: We fix a type X equipped with both a topology and a metric. In Lean, a metric space induces a topology, so having both as independent instances is atypical and potentially inconsistent (the continuity in BoundedContinuousFunction uses the TopologicalSpace instance, which may not be the one induced by the metric).
- `abbrev Cb := BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ`: Define Cb as the type of bounded continuous functions X → ℝ (continuity is with respect to the chosen TopologicalSpace X).
- `theorem cb_metric_space : MetricSpace Cb := by sorry`: Asserts that there exists a metric space structure on Cb. The docstring mentions the sup metric, but the statement itself does not specify which metric; it merely asserts existence of some metric structure.
- `theorem tendsto_iff_uniform (u : ℕ → Cb) (f : Cb) : Tendsto u atTop (𝓝 f) ↔ (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : X, |u n x - f x| < ε) := by sorry`: States that convergence of a sequence u to f in the topology on Cb is equivalent to the ε–N uniform convergence condition: for every ε > 0, eventually in n, |u n x − f x| < ε for all x ∈ X.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural statement: Given a metric space (X, d), let C_b(X, ℝ) be bounded continuous functions X → ℝ with metric d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x) − g(x)|. Show that (C_b, d) is a metric space and that convergence in d is equivalent to uniform convergence.
- The code correctly uses BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ as C_b(X, ℝ). It then claims Cb is a metric space (which in Mathlib indeed has the canonical sup-metric/norm structure). However, the theorem `cb_metric_space : MetricSpace Cb` does not specify the metric is d(f,g) = sup |f − g|; it merely asserts existence. The docstring mentions “sup metric,” but the statement itself does not enforce this.
- The second theorem precisely captures “convergence in the (sup-metric) topology” on Cb is equivalent to uniform convergence: the right-hand side is the ε–N definition of uniform convergence; the left-hand side uses the topology on Cb, which in Mathlib corresponds to the sup metric structure. So this part is essentially faithful.

Step 3: Differences and issues
- Potential mismatch of structures on X: the code assumes both `[TopologicalSpace X]` and `[MetricSpace X]` simultaneously without stating the topology is the one induced by the metric d. In the natural statement, continuity is with respect to the topology from d. In Lean, this discrepancy can be significant: BoundedContinuousFunction uses the TopologicalSpace instance, which might not coincide with the one from the MetricSpace. This is a genuine divergence from the natural language statement.
- The first theorem only asserts existence of some metric structure on Cb, rather than explicitly the sup metric d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x)−g(x)|. While Mathlib indeed equips Cb with the sup metric by default, the formal statement does not tie the result to that particular metric, relying only on a docstring.

Conclusion: The second part (equivalence to uniform convergence) is faithful in intent and content. The first part is too vague formally (existence vs. the specific sup metric), and there is a structural mismatch on X (independent topology vs. the metric-induced topology). Therefore it is very close but not fully faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- The natural statement says: ""Every proper map f : X → Y to a locally compact Hausdorff space Y is a closed map."" The Lean theorem exactly encodes: if Y is locally compact Hausdorff (via typeclass assumptions) and f is proper (Mathlib's `IsProperMap`), then f is closed (`IsClosedMap f`). This matches the quantification and conditions precisely.
- `T2Space Y` in Mathlib denotes Hausdorff, so the Hausdorff assumption is present. `LocallyCompactSpace Y` provides local compactness. `IsProperMap f` and `IsClosedMap f` are standard Mathlib predicates with their usual topological meanings; there are no placeholder or vacuous definitions.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is not weakened or strengthened beyond the intended one; it's neither a specialization nor a generalization. It is a direct formalization of the given natural language theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`: bring in Mathlib and Filter namespace.
- `variable {α : Type _} [ConditionallyCompleteLattice α]`: Work over an arbitrary type α equipped with a conditionally complete lattice structure. This is the standard structure in Mathlib allowing definitions of liminf/limsup in an order-theoretic sense.
- Theorem `liminf_le_liminf_of_le`: For sequences `x y : ℕ → α`, if `hle : ∀ n, x n ≤ y n`, then `Filter.liminf x atTop ≤ Filter.liminf y atTop`. This is exactly: if x_n ≤ y_n for all n, then liminf x ≤ liminf y.

Both theorems are stated with `sorry` proofs (placeholders), which is acceptable for auditing the statement translation.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Suppose {x_n} converges and x_n ≤ y_n for all n. Show liminf x ≤ liminf y and limsup x ≤ limsup y.
- Lean: Assumes only x_n ≤ y_n for all n, and concludes liminf x ≤ liminf y and limsup x ≤ limsup y. No convergence hypothesis is used. The results hold in full generality without convergence, so the Lean statements are a slight generalization (stronger statements) of the natural language claims.
- The Lean code also generalizes from real sequences to sequences in any conditionally complete lattice, which is an acceptable strengthening.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
- The essential mathematical content—monotonicity of liminf and limsup under pointwise inequality—is faithfully captured. The extra “x_n converges” hypothesis in the natural language is superfluous for these inequalities; omitting it in Lean is a harmless generalization. No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used. The indexing (ℕ with atTop) matches the sequence setting. Therefore, the translation is faithful (indeed, slightly stronger) to the original statement.

No discrepancies that would invalidate the translation.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `E` and `F` are real normed vector spaces (`[SeminormedAddCommGroup _] [NormedSpace ℝ _]`), with the extra assumption that `E` is finite-dimensional (`[FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`). `F` is arbitrary (not necessarily finite-dimensional). This generalizes the natural language setting of `R^n` (domain) and `R^m` (codomain) endowed with any norms, since any finite-dimensional real normed space is isomorphic to `R^n` with some norm, and we do not actually need `F` to be finite-dimensional for the stated equalities.
- Statement: For any continuous linear map `A : E →L[ℝ] F`, the theorem asserts three equalities, conjoined by `∧`:
  1) `‖A‖ = ⨆ (x : E) (h : ‖x‖ = 1), ‖A x‖`. This says the operator norm equals the supremum over the unit sphere.
  2) `‖A‖ = ⨆ (x : E) (h : ‖x‖ ≤ 1), ‖A x‖`. This says the operator norm equals the supremum over the closed unit ball.
  3) `‖A‖ = ⨆ (x : E) (h : ‖x‖ < 1), ‖A x‖`. This says the operator norm equals the supremum over the open unit ball.
  Here `⨆` (iSup) denotes the supremum over the indicated sigma-type of pairs `(x,h)` encoding the constraint on `x`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For any norm on `R^n`, on `L(R^n, R^m)` the operator norm satisfies
  `‖A‖ = max{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ = 1} = sup{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} = sup{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ < 1}`, using compactness of the unit sphere in finite dimensions.
- Match:
  - Domain generalization: The code allows any finite-dimensional real normed space `E`, which is equivalent to `R^n` with an arbitrary norm. This is a benign and faithful generalization.
  - Codomain generalization: The code allows any real normed space `F`, which includes `R^m` and is not harmful to the truth of the statement; the equalities still hold.
  - Equalities with closed and open unit balls: The code states exactly the sup equalities matching the natural language.
- Slight discrepancy:
  - The natural language explicitly states a “max” over the unit sphere (attainment of the sup on the compact sphere), whereas the Lean statement uses only a supremum `⨆` for the sphere, not explicitly asserting existence of a maximizer. Thus the first equality is slightly weaker in the formal statement: it proves equality with the supremum but does not claim the supremum is achieved. This is a small loss of information compared to “max”.

Auxiliary definitions/proofs:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated directly (with `by sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing). All terms used are standard Mathlib notions.

Final check:
- The mathematical content (operator norm equals the sup over the unit sphere, the closed unit ball, and the open unit ball in finite dimensions) is faithfully captured. The only difference is that the code does not assert “maximum” on the sphere, only “supremum.” This is a minor weakening, given the intended use of compactness in the natural proof. Everything else aligns.

Conclusion: Essentially faithful, with a small omission of the attainment (“max”) on the unit sphere.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The environment: `import Mathlib` sets up Mathlib.
- The theorem `det_row_add` is stated for a natural number `n`, a commutative ring `R`, an index `i0 : Fin n`, and three matrices `M, M1, M2 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R`.
- Hypothesis `h_rows : ∀ i j, i ≠ i0 → M i j = M1 i j` says: for every row index `i` and column index `j`, if `i` is not the distinguished row `i0`, then the entries of `M` and `M1` coincide at `(i, j)`. Equivalently, outside the row `i0`, `M` and `M1` have identical rows.
- Hypothesis `h_rows' : ∀ i j, i ≠ i0 → M1 i j = M2 i j` says: for indices not in row `i0`, `M1` and `M2` coincide. Combined with `h_rows`, this implies that outside row `i0`, all of `M, M1, M2` agree.
- Hypothesis `h_sum : ∀ j, M i0 j = M1 i0 j + M2 i0 j` says: in the distinguished row `i0`, the row of `M` equals the pointwise sum (entrywise, over columns `j`) of the corresponding rows of `M1` and `M2`.
- Conclusion: `Matrix.det M = Matrix.det M1 + Matrix.det M2`. This asserts additivity of the determinant with respect to the row `i0`, holding other rows fixed.
- The proof is omitted via `sorry`, but the statement itself is mathematically standard and meaningful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement has two parts: (a) a combinatorial inequality about subsets `S` of matrix entries and the sum of absolute values of determinant terms restricted to entries in `S`, under the condition that `S` always contains two entries from the same row or column; and (b) using that inequality to prove that the determinant is multilinear in the rows (linear in each row separately, fixing other rows).
- The Lean code does not state or encode the combinatorial inequality about `S` and absolute values at all. There is no mention of subsets of entries, permutations, determinant term expansions, or absolute values.
- The Lean code asserts only the additivity in a single row (while fixing other rows). This captures one half of linearity (additivity), but does not include homogeneity (scalar multiplication in a row), which is required for full linearity. It also does not mention multilinearity over all rows, though additivity is stated for an arbitrary fixed row `i0` and thus can be applied to any row. Still, the scalar law is missing.
- Therefore, the code is related to the second part of the natural language statement (linearity in rows) but only partially (additivity) and does not reflect the first combinatorial statement at all.

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are different. The Lean theorem is a standard additivity property of the determinant in one row, while the original statement first asserts a specific combinatorial inequality and then uses it to deduce full multilinearity (additivity + homogeneity in each row). The code neither states nor derives the combinatorial inequality and does not cover the scalar multiplication aspect of linearity. Thus, the translation is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is for `f : ℝ^n → ℝ`, differentiable at `x₀`, and claims `‖∇f(x₀)‖ = sup{ |Df(x₀) h| : ‖h‖ = 1 }`, i.e., the gradient norm equals the operator norm of the derivative.
- The Lean theorem asserts `‖gradient f x‖ = (fderiv ℝ f x).opNorm` under differentiability at `x`. In Mathlib, `(fderiv ℝ f x).opNorm` is the operator norm, which equals `sup{ ‖L h‖ : ‖h‖ ≤ 1 }`; with codomain ℝ, `‖L h‖ = |L h|`, and by homogeneity this equals the supremum over the unit sphere. Thus the Lean statement matches the natural one in content.
- The setting is slightly generalized: instead of `ℝ^n`, the Lean statement allows any complete real inner product space `F`. This is a standard and faithful generalization; in particular, it covers `ℝ^n` (which is complete and an inner product space). The assumption `HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x) x` is precisely the differentiability assumption at `x` for which the gradient is meaningful in Mathlib.

3) Final comparison:
- Mathematical content: identical (up to generalization from ℝ^n to a Hilbert space). The equivalence between operator norm and the supremum over unit vectors is standard and built into the definition of `opNorm`.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib notions (gradient, fderiv, opNorm, HasFDerivAt).

- theorem interval_integral_of_lim_of_intervals {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}
  States a theorem for real numbers a, b and a function f: ℝ → ℝ.
- (hbounded : ∃ M, ∀ x ∈ Icc a b, |f x| ≤ M)
  Assumes f is bounded on the closed interval [a, b].
- {a_n b_n : ℕ → ℝ}
  Introduces sequences a_n, b_n : ℕ → ℝ.
- (h_an_lt : ∀ n, a < a_n n)
  Assumes a < a_n for all n.
- (h_bn_lt : ∀ n, b_n n < b)
  Assumes b_n < b for all n.
- (h_an : Tendsto a_n atTop (nhds a))
  Assumes a_n → a as n → ∞.
- (h_bn : Tendsto b_n atTop (nhds b))
  Assumes b_n → b as n → ∞.
- (h_int : ∀ n, IntervalIntegrable f volume (a_n n) (b_n n))
  Assumes f is Lebesgue-interval-integrable on [a_n, b_n] (with respect to the Lebesgue measure, ""volume"") for each n. This is a measure-theoretic integrability notion, not Riemann.
- Conclusion:
  IntervalIntegrable f volume a b ∧ Tendsto (fun n => intervalIntegral f (a_n n) (b_n n) volume) atTop (nhds (intervalIntegral f a b volume))
  Concludes f is Lebesgue-interval-integrable on [a, b] and that the Lebesgue interval integrals ∫_{a_n}^{b_n} f converge to ∫_{a}^{b} f as n → ∞.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: f: [a, b] → ℝ is bounded, a < a_n < b_n < b, a_n → a, b_n → b, and f is Riemann integrable on [a_n, b_n] for all n. Then f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] and ∫_a^b f = lim ∫_{a_n}^{b_n} f (Riemann integrals).
- Code differences:
  1) Integrability notion: The code uses measure-theoretic ""IntervalIntegrable"" and ""intervalIntegral ... volume"" (Lebesgue integral), not Riemann integrability nor the Riemann integral. This is a substantial change: the assumptions are weaker (Lebesgue integrability does not imply Riemann integrability), and the conclusion is about Lebesgue integrability/integral, not Riemann.
  2) Missing inequality a_n < b_n: The code assumes only a < a_n and b_n < b, but does not require a_n < b_n. The original requires a < a_n < b_n < b for all n. Without a_n < b_n, intervals could be reversed; this changes the meaning of the integral sequence and is a real mismatch.
  3) Domain of f: The code defines f on ℝ, which is a harmless generalization of f: [a, b] → ℝ.
  4) Boundedness: The code assumes boundedness on [a, b], which matches the statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The code proves a different measure-theoretic statement: it replaces Riemann integrability by Lebesgue integrability throughout and omits the requirement a_n < b_n. Consequently, the code would apply to functions that are Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable (e.g., the Dirichlet function), which do not satisfy the original hypothesis. The conclusion is also in terms of Lebesgue integrals, not Riemann integrals.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- `universe u`: Universe declaration.
- `def LocallySimplyConnectedSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “locally simply connected” that is always true, i.e., vacuous.
- `def FinitelyGenerated (G : Type u) : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “finitely generated” that is always true and doesn’t even require a group structure, also vacuous.
- The theorem `compact_locally_simply_connected_fundamental_group_fg` states: For any type `X` with a `TopologicalSpace` structure and a `CompactSpace` instance, and any basepoint `x : X`, if `X` is “locally simply connected” (in the placeholder sense), then the “fundamental group” `FundamentalGroup X x` is “finitely generated” (in the placeholder sense). The proof is `by sorry` (omitted), but the statement uses the vacuous predicates.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The intended statement is: “Every compact, locally simply connected topological space has finitely generated fundamental group (at any basepoint).”
- The structure of the theorem matches the broad form: compact space + locally simply connected ⇒ fundamental group at a basepoint is finitely generated. The basepoint is explicitly included, which matches the parenthetical “at any basepoint”.
- However, the key predicates are placeholders set to `True`:
  - `LocallySimplyConnectedSpace` is defined as `True`, not the real Mathlib notion (and Mathlib likely does not have this exact predicate; there are related notions like locally path connected, simply connected, semilocally simply connected). This makes the hypothesis vacuous.
  - `FinitelyGenerated` is defined on any `Type` (not requiring a group structure) and is `True`, so it does not capture “finitely generated as a group” and is vacuous.
- Because of these vacuous definitions, the theorem statement does not genuinely assert the intended mathematical content; it becomes trivially true for any compact topological space and any basepoint, regardless of local simple connectivity or group structure.
- No other meaningful auxiliary definitions are provided; the only auxiliaries are the vacuous predicates.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code uses vacuous placeholders for both the hypothesis and conclusion, and does not require group structure for “finitely generated”. Even if we ignore the missing proof, the formal statement is not the same as the natural language statement in substance; it is a vacuous translation.
- If the placeholders were replaced by faithful Mathlib definitions (a proper predicate for locally simply connected spaces and a proper notion of a finitely generated group structure on `FundamentalGroup X x`), then the statement would align in form with the English statement. But as written, it fails the faithfulness requirement due to vacuity.

Conclusion: Not faithful. According to the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” so a grade around 6 is appropriate.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem improper_integral_exists_iff_tails_small (f : ℝ → ℝ)`: We fix a real-valued function on the real line.
- `(h_int : ∀ M, IntervalIntegrable f volume 0 M)`: For every real M, f is (Lebesgue) interval integrable on [0, M]. This is stronger than the natural-language hypothesis (which only needs M ≥ 0 and speaks of Riemann integrability, but Lebesgue interval integrability is a standard formalization; Riemann integrable implies Lebesgue integrable, so this is acceptable as a slight generalization/switch of framework).
- `(h_abs : True)`: This is a vacuous hypothesis. In context, it is presumably standing in for the assumption ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞, but here it carries no content. This is a red flag: the meaningful assumption has been replaced by `True`.
- Conclusion left side: `(∃ L, Tendsto (fun R => intervalIntegral f 0 R volume) atTop (nhds L))`: The improper integral from 0 to ∞ exists, i.e., the net of integrals ∫_0^R f converges as R → ∞ (R ranges over ℝ with the atTop filter; effectively R → +∞). This matches the natural language notion of existence of the improper integral.
- Conclusion right side: `(∀ ε > 0, ∃ M, ∀ R, M ≤ R → |intervalIntegral f M R volume| < ε)`: For every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, the absolute value of the integral from M to R is less than ε. This matches the “tails are small” condition in the natural statement, except that here M and R are allowed to be any reals with M ≤ R (not explicitly restricted to M ≥ 0), but since the quantifier is existential in M, one can choose M ≥ 0. So this is essentially the same statement.

2) Overall faithfulness:
- The main equivalence (existence of the improper integral iff small tails) is captured correctly in the conclusion. The formalization via Tendsto and intervalIntegral is appropriate.
- However, the crucial hypothesis “∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞” is not formalized; instead, `h_abs : True` is used, which is vacuous. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions/hypotheses be faithful and non-vacuous. Even if the equivalence does not actually need absolute integrability, the original statement includes it, and the Lean code should represent it faithfully rather than replacing it by `True`.
- The domain and integrability framework differences (ℝ domain instead of [0, ∞), Lebesgue interval integrable instead of Riemann integrable) are acceptable as standard formalization choices or slight generalizations, provided the substantive assumptions are represented.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different, due to the missing absolute integrability hypothesis: the Lean code replaces it by a vacuous `True`. All other aspects are either faithful or mildly generalized in an acceptable way. Because of the vacuous hypothesis, the translation fails per the guidelines.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in R^n.
- `variable (R R' R'' : Set (Fin n → Real))`: R, R', R'' are subsets of R^n (modeled as functions Fin n → Real).
- `variable (f : (Fin n → Real) → Real)`: f is a real-valued function on R^n.
- `variable (IsRectangle : Set (Fin n → Real) → Prop)`: A predicate intended to mean “is a rectangle,” but it is just an arbitrary predicate, not defined.
- `variable (volume : Set (Fin n → Real) → Real)`: A function intended to be the volume of a set, but introduced as an arbitrary function.
- `variable (IntegrableOn : ((Fin n → Real) → Real) → Set (Fin n → Real) → Prop)`: A predicate intended to mean “Riemann integrable on a set,” but is just an arbitrary predicate (moreover, it shadows Mathlib’s existing `IntegrableOn` for Lebesgue integrability).
- `variable (integralOn : ((Fin n → Real) → Real) → Set (Fin n → Real) → Real)`: Intended to be the integral of f over a set, but arbitrary.

The theorem:
- Assumptions: `IsRectangle R`, `IsRectangle R'`, `IsRectangle R''` (so these sets are rectangles with respect to the arbitrary predicate), `R = R' ∪ R''`, `(R' ∩ R'')` is a rectangle, `volume (R' ∩ R'') = 0` (intersection has zero ""volume"" in the arbitrary sense), and `IntegrableOn f R'`, `IntegrableOn f R''` (f is integrable on R' and R'' in the arbitrary sense).
- Conclusion: `IntegrableOn f R ∧ integralOn f R = integralOn f R' + integralOn f R''`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The intended statement: For rectangles R', R'' in R^n with R = R' ∪ R'' a rectangle and R' ∩ R'' a rectangle with one side of length 0 (hence volume zero), if f is Riemann integrable on R' and on R'', then f is Riemann integrable on R and ∫_R f = ∫_{R'} f + ∫_{R''} f.
- The Lean code mirrors the logical structure (rectangles, union equals R, intersection of volume zero, integrable on the pieces implies integrable on the union with additivity of integrals), but it does not use any Mathlib definitions for rectangles, volume, Riemann integrability, or the Riemann integral. Instead, it introduces completely unconstrained placeholders (`IsRectangle`, `volume`, `IntegrableOn`, `integralOn`). Thus the formal statement is about arbitrary predicates and functions, not the Riemann integral on rectangles.
- The detail “R' ∩ R'' is a rectangle with one side of length 0 (so volume 0)” is reduced to “intersection is a rectangle” plus “volume zero.” While this is the essential consequence used in the intended theorem, the replacement is acceptable only if `volume` is the correct notion of volume; here it is an arbitrary function.

3) Final comparison:
- Same: The overarching shape (additivity of integral over a union with measure-zero overlap, integrability on pieces implies on the union) and the sets in R^n are intended.
- Different/Issues:
  - Core mathematical notions are replaced by arbitrary, unconstrained parameters. No connection to Mathlib’s Riemann integral or even Lebesgue integral is made.
  - `IntegrableOn` and `integralOn` are not defined; they are not the Riemann integrability or integral. This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders.
  - `volume` is arbitrary; there is no guarantee it is the volume measure or that rectangles have the expected volumes.
  - `IsRectangle` is arbitrary; it need not coincide with the standard definition of a rectangle.

Conclusion: The code does not faithfully formalize the natural language statement; it states a schematic theorem about arbitrary predicates/functions rather than the specific Riemann integration result on rectangles. Hence it is not faithful.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line.
- Context: I ⊆ ℝ, f : ℝ → ℝ, c : ℝ with hc : c ∈ I, and h : DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f I c. This models a function defined on a subset I, differentiable at c within I (the usual way to formalize “f : I → ℝ is differentiable at c ∈ I”).

- Theorem differentiable_within_at.exists_linear_approx: There exist real numbers a and b such that for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 with the property that for all x ∈ I with |x − c| < δ, we have |a + b*(x − c) − f x| ≤ ε * |x − c|. This exactly matches the first claimed statement (with usual notational differences, e.g., b*(x−c) vs b(x−c), and ε|x−c| written as ε * |x − c|).

- Theorem differentiable_within_at.exists_g: Under the same assumptions, there exist real a, b and a function g : ℝ → ℝ such that Tendsto g (nhds c) (nhds 0) and for all x ∈ I, |a + b*(x − c) − f x| = |x − c| * g x. This provides the “equivalently” formulation: existence of g with limit 0 at c, and the exact identity with a factor |x−c|. The code asks for equality for all x ∈ I (not merely near c) and takes g : ℝ → ℝ with ambient limit (nhds c) rather than within (nhdsWithin c I). This is a harmless strengthening: one can define g on ℝ so that it agrees with the quotient on I and is 0 outside I near c, ensuring ambient convergence to 0. The identity holding for all x ∈ I is also stronger than “near c,” but is consistent and does not weaken the claim.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the natural statement.
- The first theorem matches the linear approximation inequality precisely.
- The second theorem captures the equivalent formulation, with a slightly stronger requirement (g on ℝ and ambient limit; equality for all x ∈ I rather than just near c). This still faithfully represents the intended statement and is a standard formalization approach.
- Using DifferentiableWithinAt with f : ℝ → ℝ and a set I is the appropriate Mathlib formalization of “f : I → ℝ differentiable at c ∈ I.”

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Differences:
  - g is defined on ℝ (code) vs on I (natural statement). This is a benign generalization.
  - Limit is taken in nhds c (ambient) rather than within I. This is stronger but still faithful as an existence claim; one can always define g to make the ambient limit 0.
  - Equality required for all x ∈ I (code) instead of “for x near c.” This is a strengthening that does not invalidate the statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are from Mathlib. The statements are legitimate and standard.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful formalization (slightly stronger) of the natural language claims.

  Natural language: For topological spaces X and Y, with Y Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`) and locally compact (`[LocallyCompactSpace Y]`), and a map f : X → Y that is continuous, injective, and a closed map, there exists a homeomorphism between X and the image of f (i.e., the subspace `range f`). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; no auxiliary placeholder definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space and f : X → Y a closed injection. Prove that f is a homeomorphism onto its image.""
- Code: Assumes Y is locally compact and Hausdorff (matches). Assumes f is injective and a closed map (matches). Additionally assumes f is continuous, which is not stated in the natural language.
- Conclusion matches: Produces a Homeomorph X (range f), i.e., f is a homeomorphism onto its image.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The only discrepancy is the added continuity assumption `Continuous f`. The natural language statement did not explicitly assume continuity. In topology, a ""closed injection"" need not be continuous, so the added continuity is a strengthening of hypotheses. This is a reasonable and standard specialization, and is in fact necessary for the conclusion to hold in general. All other aspects (Hausdorff = `T2Space`, locally compact, injective, closed map, and the exact target `range f`) align correctly. There are no vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions; all concepts are standard Mathlib ones.

Overall, the translation is essentially faithful with a mild strengthening of assumptions (continuity).

  - Statement: If `f` is continuous, then `f` is a proper map, expressed as `IsProperMap f` in Mathlib.
  - `by sorry`: no proof provided, which is acceptable for translation checking.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: “Prove that every continuous map f : X → Y from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is proper.”
- Lean: For all X compact and Y Hausdorff, any `f : X → Y` that is continuous satisfies `IsProperMap f`.
- This matches exactly: the hypotheses (compact domain, Hausdorff codomain, continuity) and the conclusion (proper map) align.
- Mathlib’s `T2Space` is the standard Hausdorff condition. `IsProperMap` is the topological notion of a proper map in Mathlib. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Step 3: Final comparison
- The two statements are the same: same assumptions and same conclusion, with standard Mathlib terminology.
- No discrepancies or extra/unmet conditions. Even if `IsProperMap` in Mathlib includes continuity as part of the definition, the implication form `Continuous f → IsProperMap f` remains a faithful formalization of “every continuous map … is proper.”

Conclusion: The translation is fully faithful.

  - The Lean theorem assumes S is totally bounded, not merely bounded. Total boundedness is strictly stronger than boundedness in general metric spaces.
  - Conclusion (S is compact) is the same kind of conclusion, but the hypotheses differ significantly.
- Mathematically, the natural language statement is false in general metric spaces; one typically needs completeness of X and total boundedness of S (or some properness condition). The Lean statement is a standard correct theorem (closed + totally bounded in a complete metric space implies compact), but it is not the same as the original claim.

- Docstring restates the natural language theorem.
- `def homeomorph_of_continuous_bijective_of_compact_t2 {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (hb : Bijective f) (hX : CompactSpace X) (hY : T2Space Y) : Homeomorph X Y := by sorry`
  Natural language paraphrase: Given topological spaces X and Y, a function f : X → Y that is continuous and bijective, with X compact and Y Hausdorff (T2), we define/produce a homeomorphism between X and Y. The proof/definition body is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The original statement: ""A continuous bijection f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism."" Mathematically, this means that the specific map f has a continuous inverse (i.e., f itself is a homeomorphism). In Lean terms, one typically proves the existence of a `Homeomorph X Y` whose underlying function is exactly f (e.g., `(e : X → Y) = f`).
- The Lean code’s conclusion type is `Homeomorph X Y`, with no requirement that the produced homeomorphism’s underlying function equals f. Thus it only asserts existence of some homeomorphism between X and Y from the given hypotheses, not that f specifically is that homeomorphism.

3) Final comparison:
- Same hypotheses: continuous f, bijective f, X compact, Y Hausdorff.
- Conclusion differs: Natural language asserts “f is a homeomorphism” (i.e., the homeomorphism is exactly f), whereas the Lean code only returns an unspecified `Homeomorph X Y` without tying it to f. This is strictly weaker and not faithful to the intended statement.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions beyond a `sorry` placeholder for the proof term; the issue is the mismatch in the statement’s target.

Verdict: Not faithful due to missing the identification of the homeomorphism’s underlying function with f. Otherwise close.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the full Mathlib library.
- `open CategoryTheory` opens the CategoryTheory namespace; it's unused and irrelevant here.
- The comment states the goal: ""Prove that every contractible space is connected and has trivial homotopy groups.""
- The theorem declaration:
  `theorem isConnected_of_contractible (Y : Type u) [TopologicalSpace Y] (h : ContractibleSpace Y) : ConnectedSpace Y := by sorry`
  This means: For any type `Y` with a topological structure, if `Y` is a contractible space (`ContractibleSpace Y`), then `Y` is a connected space (`ConnectedSpace Y`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statement only asserts: ""every contractible space is connected."" It does not address the second part of the natural language statement: ""and has trivial homotopy groups."" There is no mention of homotopy groups (fundamental or higher) in the Lean code.
- There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; the lone theorem is a standard and meaningful implication, but it captures only part of the intended statement.
- Potential technical nit: the code uses `Type u` without a `universe u` line, which typically is required, but per the problem statement we assume the code compiles. Regardless, this does not affect the semantic mismatch.

Final comparison:
- Original: ""Every contractible space is connected and has trivial homotopy groups.""
- Lean: ""Every contractible space is connected.""
- The Lean code omits the claim about trivial homotopy groups entirely, so the two statements are not the same; the code is a strict weakening of the original statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the full natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines: standard setup, no mathematical content.
- Docstring restates the natural language claim.
- `def homeomorph_of_continuous_bijective_of_compact_t2 {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (hb : Bijective f) (hX : CompactSpace X) (hY : T2Space Y) : Homeomorph X Y := by sorry`
  Natural language: For topological spaces X and Y, given a function f : X → Y that is continuous and bijective, with X compact and Y Hausdorff, we define/produce a homeomorphism between X and Y. Importantly, the output type is just `Homeomorph X Y` and does not assert that the underlying function of the homeomorphism equals f; it only guarantees the existence of some homeomorphism (as a value constructed from the inputs). Also, the body is `by sorry`, i.e., a placeholder.

Step 2: Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The original statement: “A continuous bijection f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism.” Logically, this means the specific map f is a homeomorphism; in Lean one would typically state something like: there exists a `Homeomorph X Y` whose `toFun` is f (or equivalently, define such a `Homeomorph` with `toFun := f`).
- The code’s type guarantees only that, under the given hypotheses, it returns a `Homeomorph X Y`. It does not state or enforce that this homeomorphism’s forward map is f. So it is weaker than the original: it asserts existence of some homeomorphism between X and Y, not that f itself is one.

Step 3: Final check and differences
- Difference 1 (semantic mismatch): The code does not tie the resulting homeomorphism’s `toFun` to the given f. The original explicitly asserts “f is a homeomorphism”. The code asserts only “there exists a homeomorphism between X and Y (constructed somehow from these data)”. This is strictly weaker.
- Difference 2 (vacuity): The definition ends with `by sorry`, so it provides no construction/proof. Per the guidelines, using `sorry` makes the definition vacuous for our auditing purposes.
- Otherwise, the hypotheses (CompactSpace X, T2Space Y, Continuous f, Bijective f) correctly mirror “compact X” and “Hausdorff Y” and “continuous bijection f”. The target `Homeomorph X Y` is the right concept, but crucially missing the identification with f.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to (a) the missing requirement that the homeomorphism is exactly f, and (b) the vacuous `sorry` body. Even if the `sorry` were filled, the statement would still be weaker than the original unless it encoded `e.toFun = f` (or built e from f explicitly and stated that).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, providing standard topology definitions like `TopologicalSpace`, `Continuous`, `CompactSpace`, `IsClosedMap`.
- The docstring describes the intended theorem: continuous maps from compact spaces are closed.
- `theorem continuous_map_from_compact_is_closed {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (hX : CompactSpace X) : IsClosedMap f := by sorry`
  • For arbitrary types `X` and `Y` equipped with topological space structures.
  • Given a function `f : X → Y` that is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`).
  • Given that `X` is compact as a space (`hX : CompactSpace X`).
  • Concludes that `f` is a closed map (`IsClosedMap f`), i.e., the image of any closed set under `f` is closed in `Y`.
  • The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but that does not affect the statement’s content.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: If `X` is compact and `f : X → Y` is continuous, then `f` is closed. The Lean theorem asserts exactly this: from `CompactSpace X` and `Continuous f`, deduce `IsClosedMap f`. There are no extra assumptions (e.g., Hausdorff) or missing hypotheses beyond what the natural statement included.

3) Final check for differences:
- No additional structure assumptions are imposed in Lean beyond those in the English statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- Note: Mathematically, one often needs `Y` Hausdorff for the conclusion to be true, but the natural statement also omits this, so the translation is faithful to the statement provided.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Ambient types and structures: We work with (Fin n → ℝ) as the model for ℝ^n, endowed with its NormedAddCommGroup and NormedSpace structures. The set U : Set (Fin n → ℝ) is the convex domain, f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is the scalar-valued function, and M : ℝ is the bound constant.
- hU : Convex ℝ U — U is convex.
- hcont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) U — the Fréchet derivative map x ↦ f′(x) (a continuous linear functional E →L[ℝ] ℝ at each x) is continuous on U. This is a strong formulation of “continuous partial derivatives” (in ℝ^n, continuous partials imply differentiability and continuity of the derivative on open sets; here they directly assume continuity of the full derivative on U).
- hbound : ∀ x ∈ U, ∀ v, |(fderiv ℝ f x) v| ≤ M * ‖v‖ — the operator norm of the derivative at x is bounded by M, i.e., ‖f′(x)‖ ≤ M, uniformly in x ∈ U. Since the codomain is ℝ, this matches the usual “gradient norm bounded by M” if the domain norm is the Euclidean norm and one identifies f′(x) with dotting by ∇f(x).
- Conclusion: ∀ x y, x ∈ U → y ∈ U → |f y - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x)| ≤ M * ‖y - x‖ — for all x,y ∈ U, the first-order remainder relative to the differential at x is bounded by M times the distance ‖y - x‖.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Domain/codomain: The NL statement is for f : ℝ^n → ℝ. The Lean code models ℝ^n as (Fin n → ℝ), which is standard in Mathlib.
- Regularity: NL says “have continuous partial derivatives on a convex set U.” The code assumes “x ↦ fderiv ℝ f x” is ContinuousOn U. This is a slightly stronger and more invariant assumption but in ℝ^n it encodes the same C^1-type regularity the NL is aiming at (and avoids talking about coordinates). Acceptable as a slight strengthening.
- Gradient bound: NL uses ‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M (Euclidean norm). The code uses the operator norm bound ‖f′(x)‖ ≤ M expressed as ∀ v, |f′(x) v| ≤ M ‖v‖. In Euclidean ℝ^n, identifying f′(x) with dot product by ∇f(x), the operator norm equals the norm of ∇f(x) for the Euclidean norm. So conceptually this matches the intended hypothesis — provided the underlying norm is Euclidean.
- Norm choice subtlety: The code works on the type (Fin n → ℝ) with its default normed space structure. In Mathlib, the raw Pi type typically carries the sup norm, while the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm is provided on the type alias EuclideanSpace. Since the code uses (Fin n → ℝ) directly, the implicit norm is likely the sup norm, not the Euclidean norm. This makes both the assumption (operator norm bound) and the conclusion use the sup norm on vectors, whereas the NL statement uses the Euclidean norm. On finite-dimensional spaces, norms are equivalent but not identical; this yields a slight strengthening/alteration of the metric constants (the hypothesis is stronger, and the conclusion is correspondingly stronger). This is a minor but real discrepancy.
- Expression of the remainder: The NL statement uses ∇f(x) · (y − x). The code uses (fderiv ℝ f x) (y − x), which is the coordinate-free linear functional application and corresponds exactly to the dot product with the gradient in the Euclidean structure. This is an appropriate formalization.
- Quantification and convexity: Both assume convex U and conclude the inequality for all x,y ∈ U (convexity ensures the line segment is in U for the standard integral argument). Matches the NL structure.

Final check: Are the problems the same?
- Core content: Yes — bound on the derivative/gradient by M implies the first-order remainder |f(y) − f(x) − f′(x)(y − x)| is ≤ M ‖y − x‖ for x,y ∈ a convex set. The code captures exactly this statement in a coordinate-free manner.
- Differences:
  - The code assumes continuity of the full derivative rather than “continuous partial derivatives”; this is a harmless strengthening.
  - The code uses the norm native to (Fin n → ℝ), which in Mathlib is typically the sup norm, whereas the NL statement uses the Euclidean norm. This changes the exact numerical interpretation of M. It is a noticeable but small discrepancy; the overall mathematical meaning is the same up to equivalent norms.

Given the above, the translation is essentially faithful with a mild norm-modeling discrepancy and a slightly stronger regularity hypothesis. No vacuous definitions; uses standard Mathlib notions. This merits a high score, not a perfect one due to the norm subtlety.

  Natural language: For any types X and Y equipped with topologies, if X is compact and Y is compact (in the sense of the topological-space-wide property), then the product space X × Y (with its standard product topology from the given topologies) is compact. The `CompactSpace (X × Y)` predicate is exactly the global compactness of the space X × Y, which is equivalent to saying every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover.
  The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: ""Let X and Y be compact topological spaces. Prove that every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover.""
- Lean theorem: Assumes X and Y are compact topological spaces and concludes X × Y is compact. In Mathlib, `CompactSpace Z` means Z is compact, i.e., every open cover of Z has a finite subcover (equivalently, `IsCompact (Set.univ)`). Thus the theorem statement is exactly the standard formalization of the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; no placeholders other than the proof `sorry`.
- The topology on X × Y is implicitly the product topology via the standard `TopologicalSpace (X × Y)` instance, matching the usual meaning.
- The statement about open covers is captured by `CompactSpace (X × Y)` in Mathlib. There is no change in generality or assumptions.
- Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  `CompactSpace X ↔ (∀ (u : ℕ → X), ∃ (a : X) (s : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono s ∧ Tendsto (u ∘ s) atTop (nhds a))`.

- Modeling choices are standard and correct: R^n as `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` and S^n as the unit sphere in `ℝ^{n+1}`.
- There are no auxiliary placeholder/vacuous definitions; only the final declaration is given (with an omitted proof), which is allowed per the instructions.
- The Lean statement is, if anything, slightly stronger (providing a specific homeomorphism rather than just existence), but this is a faithful formalization of “is homeomorphic to.”

Final check:
- The natural language claim and the Lean signature are the same mathematically: both assert that the one-point compactification of R^n is homeomorphic to S^n.
- No discrepancies or extra assumptions. The range of n includes 0, which remains correct (OnePoint of a point ≅ S^0).

- The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: under the assumptions that X is compact and Y is Hausdorff, any `f : X → Y` satisfying `Continuous f` is an `IsProperMap f`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; `CompactSpace`, `T2Space`, `Continuous`, and `IsProperMap` are standard Mathlib notions.
- Minor definitional nuance: in Mathlib, `IsProperMap f` typically encapsulates the standard notion of a proper map (which, in many references, includes both continuity and compact-preimage properties, and in Hausdorff targets coincides with being closed with compact fibers).

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib with topology definitions like IsClosed and IsCompact.
- open Set: Opens the namespace for set-theoretic notation; no mathematical content change.
- variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]: Work in an arbitrary topological space X.
- theorem closed_subset_of_compact (s : Set X) (hs : IsClosed s) (hcomp : IsCompact (univ : Set X)) : IsCompact s := by sorry
  Translation: For any topological space X and subset s of X, if s is closed in X (hs : IsClosed s) and the whole space X is compact (hcomp : IsCompact univ), then s is compact (IsCompact s).
  Note: ""IsCompact (univ : Set X)"" is the standard way to state that X is compact (equivalent to having the typeclass [CompactSpace X]).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
Natural language: ""Prove that a closed subset of a compact space is compact.""
The Lean statement asserts exactly that: given s closed in X and X compact (expressed as IsCompact univ), conclude s is compact. This is a standard and correct formalization.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Using IsCompact univ instead of a CompactSpace typeclass is an equivalent formulation.
- No extra hypotheses (like Hausdorff) are added, which would not be necessary.
Thus, the formal statement matches the natural language statement exactly.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Context: E is a real normed vector space (NormedAddCommGroup E and NormedSpace ℝ E). A is a continuous linear operator from E to itself (A : E →L[ℝ] E).
- Theorem 1 (opNorm_eq_supr_unit_sphere): The operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over all x with ‖x‖ = 1.
- Theorem 2 (opNorm_eq_supr_closed_unit_ball): The operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over all x with ‖x‖ ≤ 1.
- Theorem 3 (opNorm_eq_supr_open_unit_ball): The operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over all x with ‖x‖ < 1.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: A is a linear operator on ℝ^n. The operator norm defined as the maximum of ‖Ax‖ over the unit sphere equals the supremum over the closed unit ball and also equals the supremum over the open unit ball.
- The Lean statements show exactly the desired equalities of the operator norm with the supremum over each of the unit sphere, closed unit ball, and open unit ball.
- Differences:
  - Generality: The Lean code works in any real normed space E, not just ℝ^n. This is a harmless (and standard) generalization.
  - Continuity: In ℝ^n every linear map is continuous, so using E →L[ℝ] E is consistent with the ℝ^n case.
  - Max vs Sup on the sphere: The natural language defines the norm via a maximum (which is valid in ℝ^n by compactness), while the code states equality with a supremum over the sphere. In finite dimensions, these coincide, so the content about equality with the suprema over the balls is faithfully captured. The code even adds the (true) equality with the supremum over the sphere, which is consistent with the setup.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness and red flags.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib structures and statements appear.
- The theorems precisely assert the equalities between the operator norm and the suprema over the indicated sets, which is exactly what the natural language asks to prove (modulo the harmless generalization and replacing “max” by “sup” on the sphere).
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem sequentially_compact_metric_space_compact {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] (h : SequentiallyCompact X) : CompactSpace X := by sorry`:
  This states the theorem: if X is a metric space and X is sequentially compact (as defined above), then X is compact, expressed via the typeclass `CompactSpace X` (equivalently, every open cover of X has a finite subcover).

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement asserts: In a metric space, sequential compactness implies compactness (every open cover admits a finite subcover). The Lean code defines sequential compactness in the standard way and claims that under this hypothesis X is compact (CompactSpace X). In mathlib, `CompactSpace X` is the usual notion equivalent to ""every open cover of X has a finite subcover"". Thus the formal statement matches the natural language.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The definition of sequential compactness is precise and standard, not vacuous.
- The conclusion `CompactSpace X` is the standard compactness of the whole space, matching the open-cover formulation in the statement.
- No extraneous or weakening/strengthening assumptions are introduced.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per instructions as we are auditing the statement, not the proof.
Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

theorem compact_space_pi_iff : CompactSpace (∀ i, X i) ↔ ∀ i, CompactSpace (X i) := by sorry
",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The code declares an index type ι and a family of types X : ι → Type v, each equipped with a TopologicalSpace structure.
- The theorem statement is: CompactSpace (∀ i, X i) ↔ ∀ i, CompactSpace (X i).
- In words: For a given family of topological spaces (X i)i∈ι, the product space (the Pi type ∀ i, X i with the product topology) is compact if and only if each factor X i is compact.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: ""Prove that every product of topological spaces is compact if and only if a product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
- This reads as an equivalence between two global/meta statements:
  (A) Every product of topological spaces is compact.
  (B) A product of compact topological spaces is compact (i.e., Tychonoff's theorem).
- The code's statement is different: it asserts, for a specific family (X i), that the product is compact iff every factor is compact. This is the standard equivalence ""Π-compactness iff pointwise compactness"" (the forward direction is true; the reverse is Tychonoff).

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is a per-family equivalence of properties: product compactness ↔ coordinatewise compactness.
- The natural language statement, as written, asserts an equivalence between two global propositions about all products versus products of compact spaces. One direction (A ⇒ B) is trivial; the other (B ⇒ A) is generally false, and in any case it is not the same assertion as the per-family equivalence.
- Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the provided natural language statement.

Additional checks:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; the theorem uses standard Mathlib definitions (CompactSpace). However, the mismatch in meaning is substantial.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

  • Types X and Y are arbitrary types with topological space structures.

  • The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but the statement itself exactly encodes the claim.

The natural language statement: Given topological spaces X and Y and continuous maps f, g: X → Y, if Y is Hausdorff then A = {x ∈ X : f(x) = g(x)} is closed in X. The Lean statement precisely mirrors this: same spaces, same continuity assumptions, the Hausdorff condition on Y via `[T2Space Y]`, and the same set `{x | f x = g x}` being closed.

3) Final comparison:
The two statements are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace, T2Space, Continuous, IsClosed). The minor stylistic difference of not naming the set A does not change meaning. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- The theorem is named to assert finite generation of the fundamental group under compactness, path-connectedness, and local simple connectivity.
- Assumptions:
  - X is a type with a TopologicalSpace structure.
  - [CompactSpace X]: X is compact.
  - [PathConnectedSpace X]: X is path connected.
  - hloc: For every point x in X, there exists an open set U ⊆ X with x ∈ U and such that the subspace {y : X | y ∈ U} (i.e., the open subset U with the subspace topology) is a SimplyConnectedSpace. This encodes that each point has a simply connected open neighborhood.
- Conclusion:
  - For every basepoint x0 : X, there exists a finite subset S of the fundamental group FundamentalGroup X x0 such that the subgroup generated by S equals the whole group (i.e., the top subgroup ⊤). This is the standard formalization that the group is finitely generated.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the fundamental group of any compact, path connected, and locally simply connected topological space is finitely generated.""
- The code assumes compactness and path connectedness via typeclasses, and a local simple connectivity condition via hloc: existence of an open simply connected neighborhood at each point. It concludes finite generation of π1(X, x0) for every basepoint x0, by exhibiting a finite generating set S.
- This matches the intended mathematical content: a finitely generated fundamental group under the stated hypotheses. Quantifying over all basepoints is appropriate and even a bit stronger than simply stating it for one basepoint (in a path-connected space the groups are isomorphic anyway).

3) Final check and differences:
- Potential nuance: Some definitions of ""locally simply connected"" require a neighborhood basis (i.e., for every neighborhood V of x there is a simply connected U with x ∈ U ⊆ V), whereas the code assumes merely the existence of one simply connected open neighborhood per point. The code’s assumption is weaker than the strongest common definition and thus slightly generalizes the natural language statement. This is acceptable per the guidelines as a slight generalization and does not constitute a mismatch in the intended direction.
- All constructs used are legitimate Mathlib notions (FundamentalGroup, Subgroup.closure, SimplyConnectedSpace on a subtype, etc.). There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a slight strengthening) of the given natural language statement.

- Theorem `fundamental_group_countable_of_countable_basis_simply_connected ... : Countable (fundamental_group X x0) := by sorry`: States that under the placeholder hypotheses, the (placeholder) fundamental group is countable; the proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If X is path connected and has a countable basis of simply connected open sets, then π1(X) is countable.
- The Lean code mirrors the structure of the statement (hypotheses and conclusion) but replaces all key notions with vacuous placeholders:
  - Simply connectedness: always True.
  - Having a countable basis of simply connected opens: always True.
  - Path connectedness: always True.
  - Fundamental group: replaced by PUnit, which is trivially countable and does not reflect π1(X).
- Additionally, the theorem ends with `by sorry`, so even within the placeholder world, it is not proved.
- These placeholders make the statement vacuous and unfaithful to the actual mathematics. In particular, redefining the fundamental group as PUnit is a severe deviation.

3) Final comparison:
- The intended and the formalized problems are not the same. The code does not genuinely express the real topological hypotheses nor the real conclusion about π1(X). Multiple auxiliary definitions are vacuous, and the core object (fundamental group) is misrepresented. Thus, the translation fails.

Given that, if all placeholders were replaced by their genuine Mathlib counterparts, the theorem statement would align with the natural language statement, so this falls under the rubric of vacuous placeholders but a faithful high-level shape.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The theorem statement is:
  theorem benmckay_top_continuity_232 (n : ℕ) :
    Nonempty (Homeomorph (Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit)
      {x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // x ∈ Metric.sphere (0 : Fin (n+1) → ℝ) 1}) := by sorry
- Natural language translation: For each natural number n, there exists a homeomorphism between the topological space Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit and the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1} (modeled as Fin (n+1) → ℝ), i.e., the subtype of vectors of norm 1. Here Sum denotes the topological coproduct (disjoint union) and PUnit is a one-point type. The proof is omitted.
- Auxiliary comments in the file assert this is intended to express the one-point compactification of ℝ^n being homeomorphic to S^n, with ℝ^n modeled as Fin n → ℝ and S^n as the metric sphere. However, the actual formal objects used are Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit on the left and the metric sphere on the right.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that the one point compactification of ℝ^n is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n.""
- In Mathlib, the one-point compactification is modeled by OnePoint α (aka Alexandroff one-point compactification), not by the disjoint sum α ⊕ PUnit. The topology on OnePoint α is very different from the coproduct topology of Sum α PUnit: in the latter, the extra point is an isolated open point, and the space is typically not compact if α is non-compact (e.g., ℝ^n). In contrast, OnePoint α is compact by construction.
- Therefore, the Lean code's left-hand space Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit is not the one-point compactification of ℝ^n; it is the topological sum of ℝ^n with an isolated point. Consequently, the theorem as stated claims the existence of a homeomorphism between a non-compact space (for n ≥ 1) and the compact sphere S^n, which is false. This is not a faithful formalization of the intended statement.
- The right-hand side modeling of S^n as the metric sphere {x | dist x 0 = 1} in Fin (n+1) → ℝ is fine and standard.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Original: OnePoint(ℝ^n) ≅ S^n.
- Code: Sum(ℝ^n, PUnit) ≅ S^n.
- These are different spaces. The left-hand side in code is not the one-point compactification and leads to an incorrect claim in general. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced, but the main statement itself mismodels the intended mathematical object.
- A faithful statement should have used OnePoint (Fin n → ℝ) in place of Sum (Fin n → ℝ) PUnit.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `: f = g` is the conclusion that f and g are equal as functions on all of X.

Assessment vs. the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement requires that Y be Hausdorff. In Mathlib, this is expressed by the typeclass `[T2Space Y]`.
- The Lean theorem’s docstring mentions Hausdorff, and the name `..._of_T2` suggests a Hausdorff requirement, but the actual theorem signature does not include `[T2Space Y]`. It only assumes `[TopologicalSpace Y]`.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly stronger (and in fact generally false) than the intended statement, because without the Hausdorff assumption the conclusion need not hold.
- All other components (dense subset, continuous f and g, agreement on A, equality conclusion) align correctly with the natural language statement.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the terms used (Dense, Continuous, EqOn) are standard Mathlib.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same: the Lean code omits the crucial hypothesis that Y is Hausdorff. This is a significant discrepancy, not a harmless generalization.

- The docstring says: assume Y is Hausdorff (T2) and f,g continuous; if they agree on a dense subset, then f = g. However, the actual theorem statement does not include continuity of f and g.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: X is Hausdorff; Y is any topological space; f and g are continuous; if they agree on a dense subset of X, then f = g.
- Code: Y is Hausdorff; no condition on X beyond being a topological space; no continuity of f and g; if they agree on a dense subset, then f = g.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- The Hausdorff assumption is on the wrong space: the natural statement requires X Hausdorff, but the code assumes Y Hausdorff. This is a substantive difference.
- The code omits the continuity assumptions on f and g altogether, which is essential; without continuity, the statement is false in general.
- While the density condition and conclusion match in form, the hypotheses are materially different. Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ} (b : Fin n → ℝ)`: We fix a natural number n and a vector b indexed by Fin n, i.e., b ∈ ℝ^n represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`.
- `def dot_linear_map : (Fin n → ℝ) →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ := { toFun := fun x => ∑ i : Fin n, b i * x i, ... }`: This defines a linear map from ℝ^n to ℝ given by x ↦ ∑ b_i x_i, i.e., the dot product with b. However, the required proofs of additivity and homogeneity (`map_add'`, `map_smul'`) are filled with `sorry` placeholders.
- `def dot_continuous_linear_map : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] ℝ := ContinuousLinearMap.mk (dot_linear_map (b := b)) (by sorry)`: This upgrades the linear map to a continuous linear map by providing a (missing) proof of continuity, again with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is explicitly about ℝ^n with the standard Euclidean norm, and the operator norm on L(ℝ^n, ℝ) induced by that Euclidean norm. It claims that the operator norm of the functional x ↦ b · x equals the Euclidean norm ‖b‖.
- In Lean, the type `(Fin n → ℝ)` carries by default the sup norm (ℓ∞) on the product type, not the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm. To model Euclidean norm one should use `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (or an equivalent ℓ2 construction). This code uses `(Fin n → ℝ)` directly without changing the norm structure, so the norm on the domain and on the vector b is the sup norm. Under this norm, the operator norm of x ↦ ∑ b_i x_i is actually the ℓ1 norm of b, not the sup norm and not the Euclidean norm. Thus the stated equality is not the same as the natural statement, and in fact is incorrect for the default norms.
- Furthermore, the code relies on multiple `sorry`s both for linearity proofs, continuity, and the main theorem, which are vacuous placeholders. Per the guidelines, such placeholders cause the translation to fail.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The natural statement concerns Euclidean norm; the Lean code uses `(Fin n → ℝ)` with the default sup norm, and equates the operator norm with that norm on b. This is a different and incorrect statement in that setting. Additionally, the code is incomplete due to `sorry`s in essential places. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We fix a natural number n, the dimension.
- `def linear_of_vec (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ) := ...`: This defines a linear map A from ℝ to (Fin n → ℝ) by A x = x • a, i.e., scalar multiplication of the vector a by the real x.
- `def A (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ →L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ) := ...`: This packages the above linear map as a continuous linear map.
- `theorem opNorm_of_smul_vec (a : Fin n → ℝ) : ‖A a‖ = ‖a‖ := by sorry`: This states that the operator norm of A equals the norm of a in the codomain norm on (Fin n → ℝ).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is explicitly about ℝ^n with the standard Euclidean norm, and the map A: ℝ → ℝ^n defined by A x = x a. It claims that the operator norm of A equals the Euclidean norm of a.
- In the Lean code, the codomain is `(Fin n → ℝ)`. While this is a standard representation of ℝ^n as functions from a finite type to ℝ, the crucial point is which norm instance is being used. By default in Mathlib, the norm on a Pi type `(ι → E)` is the sup (∞-norm), not the Euclidean (2-norm). To get the Euclidean norm one typically uses the type alias `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, which carries the inner product and the induced Euclidean norm. The current code does not use `EuclideanSpace`, nor does it otherwise override the default norm. Therefore, `‖a‖` in the Lean theorem refers to the sup norm of `a`, not the Euclidean norm.
- Consequently, the theorem in Lean is asserting that the operator norm equals the sup norm of `a` (with respect to the sup norm on (Fin n → ℝ)), whereas the natural language statement asserts equality with the Euclidean norm. These are generally different for n ≥ 2.

3) Final comparison:
- Core mapping A x = x a is faithful.
- Domain ℝ and continuous linear map structure are faithful.
- The key mismatch is the norm on the codomain: Lean’s code uses the default sup norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)`, while the natural language requires the Euclidean norm. This is a substantive difference in the statement’s meaning. No vacuous definitions are present; the auxiliary definitions are legitimate. However, the norm choice is essential to the claim.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the norm mismatch. A faithful version should use `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` as the codomain (and take `a : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def I : Type := { t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1 }` defines the unit interval as a subtype of real numbers. This matches [0,1].
- `def IsSmooth {M : Type u} (f : I → M) : Prop := True` is a placeholder: it declares every map `I → M` to be ""smooth"". This is vacuous and not the real Mathlib notion of smoothness on manifolds.
- `def HomotopicRel {M : Type u} (f g : I → M) : Prop := True` is another placeholder: it declares any two maps to be homotopic relative to endpoints, but it does not encode endpoints or any homotopy data. Vacuous.
- The theorem `theorem path_homotopic_rel_endpoints_to_smooth {M : Type u} (x : I → M) : ∃ y : I → M, IsSmooth (y) ∧ HomotopicRel x y := by sorry` states that for any type `M` and any path `x : I → M`, there exists a `y` such that `IsSmooth y` and `HomotopicRel x y` hold. Given the placeholders, this theorem is trivially true for any `M` and any `x`, and moreover does not require any manifold structure or actual endpoint-relative homotopy.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement requires: (1) `M` is a smooth manifold; (2) `x : [0,1] → M` is a path; (3) there exists a smooth path `y` such that `x` is homotopic to `y` relative to `{0,1}` (i.e., endpoints fixed). 
- The code omits any manifold structure on `M`. There are no `ChartedSpace`/`SmoothManifoldWithCorners` assumptions; `M` is just an arbitrary type.
- The notion of smoothness is vacuous (`True`), so it does not express actual smoothness on manifolds.
- The notion of homotopy relative to endpoints is vacuous (`True`) and does not mention or enforce fixing `{0,1}`.
- The theorem uses `sorry` (allowed in a user file), but more importantly, because of vacuous predicates, it does not capture the real content of the statement.

Final check:
- The mathematical content in the code is not the same as the original statement. It lacks the manifold structure, uses placeholder predicates for smoothness and homotopy rel endpoints, and thus does not faithfully translate the claim. If the placeholders were replaced with the proper Mathlib notions and the appropriate manifold structure assumptions were added, the resulting statement would match the intended theorem. As is, it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definitions for key concepts (smoothness, homotopy rel endpoints) and missing manifold assumptions. However, the overall shape of the theorem (existence of a smooth path homotopic to the given one) matches the intended claim if the placeholders were properly implemented. Hence: grade 6 (vacuous definitions, but fixable to be faithful).

- The conclusion `∃ (m : PseudoMetricSpace Y), ...` states: there exists a pseudometric space structure m on Y such that the topology induced by the uniform structure coming from m equals a certain coinduced topology.
- The equality `@UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace Y (@PseudoMetricSpace.toUniformSpace Y m) = TopologicalSpace.coinduced f (@UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace X (@PseudoMetricSpace.toUniformSpace X _))` says: the topology on Y arising from the pseudometric m is exactly the coinduced (final) topology on Y via f from the topology on X coming from its pseudometric. In words: Y’s topology is the coinduced topology via f, and it is also induced by a pseudometric on Y.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let f : X → Y be surjective, with X a metric space. Prove that the quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric on Y.
- The code’s statement: If X is a pseudometric space and f is surjective, then the coinduced (quotient) topology on Y is induced by some pseudometric on Y.

3) Similarities and differences:
- Similarities: Both consider a surjective map f from a (pseudo)metric space X; both identify the coinduced (quotient) topology on Y (the coinduced topology matches the quotient topology induced by f); both claim this topology is induced by a distance function on Y.
- Key differences:
  - The natural language requires a metric on Y; the code provides only a pseudometric on Y. This is a strict weakening: pseudometrics allow distinct points at zero distance, so not every pseudometrizable space is metrizable.
  - The code assumes X is only a pseudometric space, which is a generalization of the hypothesis (metric → pseudometric). This generalization is fine, but the target weakening (metric → pseudometric on Y) changes the claim’s strength.

4) Verdict:
- The core mathematical meaning differs: the original claims metrizability of Y (a strictly stronger property); the code claims only pseudometrizability. This is not a faithful translation of the original statement, even though it is a standard correct variant.

- `universe u`: Set a universe level.
- `constant DeckTrans : Type u → Type u`: Introduces an uninterpreted placeholder assigning to each type X a type `DeckTrans X`, intended to represent the deck transformation group, but without any structure or link to topology or universal covers.
- `constant FundamentalGroup : Type u → Type u`: Introduces another uninterpreted placeholder assigning to each type X a type `FundamentalGroup X`, intended to represent the fundamental group, but again with no basepoint, no group structure, and no topological context.
- The theorem:

  This asserts that for any type X and any three propositions (named to suggest Hausdorff, path connected, and locally simply connected), there is an equivalence of types between `DeckTrans X` and `FundamentalGroup X`. It uses `≃` (type equivalence), not a group isomorphism. The hypotheses are mere `Prop` parameters and are not tied to any actual topological structure (`[TopologicalSpace X]`, `T2Space X`, path-connectedness, locally simply connectedness, etc.). There is no mention of a universal cover in the formal statement (only in the comment). No group structure or operation is specified, and nothing encodes the action `[x][y] = [x*y]` (concatenation of loops) or the fact we are comparing groups.

2) Faithfulness assessment vs the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For X a Hausdorff, path connected, locally simply connected topological space, the deck transformation group of the universal covering space is precisely π₁(X), with multiplication induced by concatenation of loops.
- Discrepancies:
  - No topological structure on X is assumed in code; X is just a `Type u`. The hypotheses are dummy `Prop` parameters not connected to X in any way.
  - The theorem claims an equivalence of types `DeckTrans X ≃ FundamentalGroup X`, not a group isomorphism. It omits group structure entirely. The deck transformation group and fundamental group are groups; the correct formal target would be a group isomorphism (e.g., `DeckTrans X ≃* FundamentalGroup X` or `DeckTrans X ≅ FundamentalGroup X` with appropriate group structures).
  - No universal cover appears in the formal statement; `DeckTrans X` is an uninterpreted constant type depending only on X, not on a specific covering space. The theorem's comment mentions universal covering, but the statement does not formalize it.
  - No basepoint is handled. In Mathlib, the fundamental group requires a basepoint and for path-connected spaces the fundamental groups at different basepoints are canonically isomorphic. The placeholder `FundamentalGroup : Type u → Type u` forgets this crucial detail.
  - The action law `[x][y] = [x*y]` (concatenation of loops) is not encoded anywhere.
  - The placeholders `DeckTrans` and `FundamentalGroup` are vacuous constants rather than Mathlib definitions, violating the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean code provides a vacuous, structureless type equivalence between two arbitrary placeholder types depending on X, with irrelevant and unused propositional parameters. It does not capture the topological hypotheses, the universal covering, the group structure, nor the loop concatenation operation. Even if the placeholders were replaced by proper definitions, the current statement still asserts a mere type equivalence and lacks all necessary structure and assumptions; therefore it is not a faithful translation.

Given these issues, this translation fails the faithfulness criteria.

The proof is omitted with sorry.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The core notion “covering map” is represented by IsCovering p := True, i.e., a vacuous placeholder. This is a serious deviation: the statement’s meaning depends crucially on the definition of covering map; here it imposes no condition at all. Thus even if the premises hold, the conclusion does not assert that p is a covering map in any meaningful sense.
- The hypothesis intended to encode “locally simply connected” is hlsc: ∀ x, ∃ U open with x ∈ U and SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U). Standardly, “locally simply connected” means each point has a neighborhood basis of simply connected open neighborhoods. The code only requires existence of one such open neighborhood at each point, which is strictly weaker than having a basis, so the assumption is not faithful to the usual definition. This is another discrepancy.
- The theorem asserts existence of Y, a topology on Y, and p : Y → X such that IsCovering p ∧ SimplyConnectedSpace Y. Even if IsCovering were fixed to the genuine covering map notion, the statement would be close to “there is a simply connected covering space over X” which is a common formulation of “universal cover exists.” However, as written, it does not state any ‘universal’ factorization property (usually automatic once the covering is simply connected under standard hypotheses), which is acceptable as a standard shorthand. The bigger problem remains the vacuous IsCovering.
- Potential technical note: the theorem quantifies a topology tY on Y but does not install it as a typeclass instance for SimplyConnectedSpace Y or IsCovering p. In typical Lean this would require letI := tY. The prompt states the code compiles; if so, that is only because IsCovering is True and does not truly depend on the instance, but SimplyConnectedSpace Y would still require an instance. This is a red flag about the practical correctness of the code structure, but the main audit concern is semantic faithfulness.

3) Final comparison:
- Original statement: For each path connected and locally simply connected topological space X, there exists a universal covering space \tilde{X} → X (i.e., a covering map from a simply connected space over X).
- Lean code statement: If X is path connected and at each point has some open simply connected neighborhood, then there exists Y with some topology and a map p : Y → X such that IsCovering p (vacuous) and Y is simply connected. Differences:
  - “Covering map” is replaced by a vacuous predicate True.
  - “Locally simply connected” is weakened from having a basis of simply connected neighborhoods to having at least one such neighborhood per point.
  - No universality clause (acceptable shorthand), but combined with the vacuous covering predicate, the conclusion is not the intended one.
Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Grade rationale: Major issues include a vacuous definition for the key concept and a weakened hypothesis. If these were fixed (replace IsCovering by a genuine covering-map predicate and strengthen hlsc to a basis condition), the final theorem would match the intended meaning, so this is not completely unrelated; thus a mid-level score is appropriate.

- `class LocalDiffeomorphism {P Q : Type _} (f : P → Q) : Prop := (out : True)`: Placeholder predicate for “f is a local diffeomorphism”, vacuous.
- `class ProperMap {P Q : Type _} (f : P → Q) : Prop := (out : True)`: Placeholder predicate for “f is proper”, vacuous.
- `class CoveringMap {P Q : Type _} (f : P → Q) : Prop := (out : True)`: Placeholder predicate for “f is a covering map”, vacuous.
- Lemma: `lemma proper_local_diffeomorphism_is_covering_map {P Q : Type _} [ManifoldWithoutBoundary P] [ManifoldWithoutBoundary Q] (f : P → Q) (Q_connected : Prop) [LocalDiffeomorphism (f := f)] [ProperMap (f := f)] : CoveringMap (f := f) := by sorry`
  Translation: Given types P and Q with (vacuous) instances that they are manifolds without boundary, a map f : P → Q, an arbitrary proposition `Q_connected`, and (vacuous) instances that f is a local diffeomorphism and is proper, then f is a (vacuous) covering map. Proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""Every proper local diffeomorphism f : P → Q between manifolds without boundary, with Q connected, is a covering map."" This requires genuine notions: manifold (without boundary), local diffeomorphism, proper map, covering map, and Q connected.
- The code replaces all these notions with vacuous placeholder classes (each with `out : True`), so they do not encode any real structure or property.
- The assumption that Q is connected is modeled as an arbitrary `Prop` named `Q_connected`, not as a meaningful connectedness predicate on Q (e.g., `ConnectedSpace Q` or `IsConnected (univ : Set Q)`), so it does not express connectedness of Q at all.
- Therefore, the statement in Lean is not a faithful formalization of the intended mathematical theorem. It becomes a vacuous, entirely conditional statement on placeholder predicates.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different: the Lean code uses vacuous placeholder definitions for all key concepts and does not encode connectedness of Q. Even if the proof is omitted (which is acceptable for translation), the statement itself is not faithful to the mathematical content. If all placeholders were replaced by real Mathlib notions and `Q_connected` by a proper connectedness hypothesis, the shape of the lemma would match the natural language statement; but as written, it is not faithful.

Given these discrepancies, the translation fails under the provided guidelines.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem `continuous_inverse_of_continuous_bijective_compact_to_T2` states: Let X and Y be types with topological spaces. Assume X is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`), Y is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), and X is nonempty (`[Nonempty X]`). Let f : X → Y be continuous (`hf : Continuous f`) and bijective (`hbij : Function.Bijective f`). Then `Function.invFun f` (the set-theoretic inverse function of f) is continuous.
- There are no auxiliary fake definitions; just a theorem statement with a placeholder proof `by sorry`.
- Note: In Mathlib, `Function.invFun f` is the inverse map for a bijection (definitionally agrees pointwise), so the intended meaning is that f^{-1} is continuous.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: “Suppose that f: X → Y is a continuous bijection from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y. Prove that the inverse f^{-1}: Y → X is continuous.” This claims continuity of the inverse under only the assumptions: X a topological space, Y Hausdorff, f continuous and bijective.
- Lean theorem adds two extra hypotheses: (i) X is compact, (ii) X is nonempty. The compactness assumption is crucial: without it, the original statement is false in general (e.g., the identity map from the Sorgenfrey line to the real line is a continuous bijection onto a Hausdorff space whose inverse is not continuous). The nonempty assumption is an additional technical condition not present in the original statement; moreover, it isn’t necessary for the claim when f is bijective (the empty case is harmless), so it further deviates.
- Thus, the Lean theorem proves a strictly stronger/harder-to-satisfy claim (a specialization) than the original statement. Because the original statement is false in general and the code proves the standard corrected version (compact domain + Hausdorff codomain), the code does not faithfully translate the original claim.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code requires X to be compact and nonempty, whereas the original asks for X to be an arbitrary topological space. This materially changes the theorem. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the statement is legitimate.
- The docstring in Lean explicitly mentions compactness, aligning with the code but not with the user’s natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's topology library.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are types with topological space structures.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem proper_iff_closed_map_and_compact_fibers {f : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) [T2Space Y] : IsProperMap f ↔ (∀ y : Y, IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})) ∧ IsClosedMap f := by sorry`
  • Assumptions: a function `f : X → Y`, with `hf : Continuous f`, and `Y` is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`).
  • Conclusion: `IsProperMap f` if and only if both conditions hold: (i) for every `y : Y`, the fiber `f ⁻¹' {y}` is compact (`IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})`), and (ii) `f` is a closed map (`IsClosedMap f`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let f : X → Y be a continuous map to a Hausdorff space Y. Prove that f is proper iff (a) every fiber f^{-1}(y) is compact, and (b) f is a closed map.""
- Lean: Exactly matches. Continuity is assumed via `hf : Continuous f`. Hausdorffness of Y is encoded by `[T2Space Y]`. Properness is `IsProperMap f`. Fiber compactness is `∀ y, IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})`. Closed map is `IsClosedMap f`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions use Mathlib's standard definitions. The theorem is stated as an equivalence as requested.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- The two statements are the same mathematically. The code does not add extra constraints or weaken any condition. The use of `IsProperMap` aligns with the standard topological notion of proper maps in Mathlib, and the assumptions (continuity and Hausdorff Y) match the natural language statement. There are no discrepancies.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set` just bring in Mathlib and set-theoretic notation.
- `def my_closure {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] (A : Set X) : Set X := sInter {C : Set X | IsClosed C ∧ A ⊆ C}`
  Natural language: Given a topological space X and a subset A ⊆ X, define `my_closure A` to be the intersection of all closed sets C that contain A. This is the standard characterization of the topological closure of A.
- `theorem subset_my_closure {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X} : A ⊆ my_closure A := by sorry`
  Natural language: In any topological space X and for any subset A, A is contained in `my_closure A` (i.e., in the intersection of all closed supersets of A). This matches the usual fact that A ⊆ closure(A).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to prove A ⊆ \overline{A} (the closure of A). The code defines a closure-like object `my_closure` exactly as the intersection of all closed supersets of A, which is a standard definition of the closure. Then it states the theorem `A ⊆ my_closure A`. This is precisely the same mathematical statement with the closure defined in the standard way.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used. The auxiliary definition `my_closure` is legitimate and matches a canonical definition from topology.
- The use of a custom name `my_closure` instead of Mathlib's `closure` does not change the meaning; it is an equivalent concept by definition here. The final theorem is exactly the desired statement under that definition.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same: prove A is contained in its closure. The Lean code’s statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- Missing/incorrect elements in the Lean code:
  - There is no assumption that f is a covering map. This is essential to the theorem.
  - The domain `pi_quot` is an arbitrary type, not defined as the quotient of π1(Y, y0) by the subgroup f_*(π1(X, x0)). There is no use or mention of fundamental groups, induced homomorphism f_*, or quotient structures.
  - The map `to_fiber` is an arbitrary function; it is not defined as the canonical map from the coset space to the fiber.
  - The theorem asserts bijectivity of an arbitrary function with no hypotheses, which is vastly stronger and unrelated to the intended mathematical content.
  - The provided equality `h : f x0 = y0` is not used in the theorem statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code does not formalize π1, the quotient by f_*(π1), or the canonical map; it omits the covering map hypothesis; and claims bijectivity for an arbitrary function from an arbitrary type. These are substantial discrepancies.
- Additionally, the introduction of `pi_quot` and `to_fiber` as arbitrary placeholders constitutes vacuous stand-ins; even though the file compiles, these do not faithfully represent the mathematical objects in the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any topological space X and a map p : ℝ → X which is a covering map, assuming X is connected, then either X is homeomorphic to ℝ or X is homeomorphic to the circle S¹. The use of `Nonempty (Homeomorph X Real)` and `Nonempty (Homeomorph X Circle)` encodes “X is homeomorphic to ℝ” or “X is homeomorphic to S¹”. `IsCoveringMap p` is the Mathlib notion of p being a covering map. `Circle` is Mathlib’s standard S¹. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable since we only check the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement: “Prove that the only topological spaces with ℝ as a covering space are ℝ and S¹.” That means: if there exists a covering map p : ℝ → X (so X is a space covered by ℝ), then X must be homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹.
The Lean theorem assumes connectedness of X as an explicit hypothesis. In standard covering space theory, a covering map is surjective, and the continuous image of connected ℝ is connected, hence X is automatically connected. In Mathlib, `IsCoveringMap` ensures surjectivity (since every point has an evenly covered neighborhood), so the connectedness of X follows from the existence of such p. Therefore, the explicit `ConnectedSpace X` hypothesis is redundant and does not change the meaning; the Lean statement is equivalent in substance to the natural language statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Quantification: both quantify over all spaces X admitting a covering map p : ℝ → X.
- Conclusion: both assert X ≅ ℝ or X ≅ S¹.
- Extra hypothesis: Lean includes `ConnectedSpace X`, but this is implied by the existence of a covering map from connected ℝ, so it does not restrict the class of X’s under consideration.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are used; all notions (`IsCoveringMap`, `Homeomorph`, `Circle`) are standard Mathlib.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

2) Assessment:
- The natural language statement is about subspaces of Euclidean spaces with the subspace topologies. Such subspaces are metric spaces with the induced metric, and the topologies coincide with the metric topologies. The Lean statement treats the more general setting of arbitrary metric spaces, which strictly includes the Euclidean subspace case. This is a standard and faithful generalization.
- The left-hand side uses `Continuous f`, i.e., preimage-of-open-sets continuity. The right-hand side is exactly the ε–δ condition in metric spaces. This matches the intended equivalence.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. Everything relies on standard Mathlib notions (`MetricSpace`, `Continuous`, `dist`). The presence of `by sorry` only omits the proof and does not affect the statement’s faithfulness.

3) Final check/differences:
- Difference: Lean states the result for all metric spaces, while the natural statement restricts to subspaces of Euclidean spaces. This is a benign generalization and fully covers the intended case. No other discrepancies.
- The ε–δ formulation uses the intrinsic metrics on X and Y, which coincide with the subspace metrics in the Euclidean-subspace case, so it matches the usual ε–δ sense for subspaces.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: “Prove that the Euclidean plane R^2 is homeomorphic to any open ball in R^2.”
- The Lean statement universally quantifies over any center `c` and any radius `r` with `r > 0` (which is exactly the condition for an open ball), and asserts that there exists a homeomorphism between `ℝ × ℝ` (a standard model of R^2) and `Metric.ball c r` (the open ball in `ℝ^2`). This precisely matches the mathematical statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; it’s a single theorem statement. Using `ℝ × ℝ` for `ℝ^2` is standard and faithful.

- Domain/codomain: ℝ × ℝ vs ℝ^2 — these are the same object in this context.
- “Any open ball” vs requiring `0 < r` — consistent with the definition of an open ball.

The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The intended natural language statement: Let M and N be smooth manifolds and let f ∈ C^0(M,N) (i.e., f is continuous). Show that f is homotopic to a smooth map M → N.
- The Lean statement mirrors the logical shape: from ""M, N are smooth manifolds"" and ""f is continuous"" conclude existence of a smooth g homotopic to f. However, all the predicates used are placeholders defined as True, so they do not encode the mathematical content (no manifold structure, no topology, no smoothness). Consequently, the theorem is vacuously easy and does not faithfully represent the intended concepts.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
- Differences:
  - The Lean code does not use Mathlib's manifold/smooth map/homotopy notions; instead it introduces vacuous predicates equal to True.
  - No structures (TopologicalSpace, ChartedSpace, Smooth manifolds with model with corners, etc.) are used. Thus the statement in Lean is about arbitrary types and arbitrary functions with trivial properties.
  - `IsHomotopic` being True makes the conclusion trivial for any f and any g, not capturing genuine homotopy.
  - The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per the auditing guidelines, the main issue is the vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: The code is not a legitimate, faithful translation. If the placeholders were replaced by the correct Mathlib definitions (smooth manifolds, continuous maps, smooth maps, homotopy), the theorem statement would match the natural language statement. As is, it fails due to vacuous definitions.

- `variable {X : Type u} {Y : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We work with topological spaces X and Y.
- `variable (IsCovering : (X → Y) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate on maps X → Y, intended to mean ""is a covering map"", but with no definition or link to Mathlib's notion.
- `variable (pi1 : Type u → Type u)`: Introduces an arbitrary type-valued functor from spaces to types, intended to be the fundamental group, but it lacks any structure (e.g., no basepoint, no group structure) or connection to Mathlib.
- `variable (pi1_map : ∀ (f : X → Y), pi1 X → pi1 Y)`: For each map f : X → Y, introduces an arbitrary function between the associated types pi1 X and pi1 Y, intended to be the induced map on fundamental groups, but with no constraints (e.g., functoriality, basepoints) and not tied to covering maps.
- The theorem:
  `theorem covering_map.induced_on_fundamental_group_injective (f : X → Y) (hcov : IsCovering f) [T2Space X] : Function.Injective (pi1_map f) := by sorry`
  This states: For a map f : X → Y which satisfies the arbitrary predicate IsCovering and with X Hausdorff, the arbitrarily provided function pi1_map f is injective. There is no proof (sorry), but our task is to check the statement, not the proof.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: ""The morphism of fundamental groups f_* : π1(X) → π1(Y) induced by a covering map f : X → Y on a Hausdorff space X is injective.""
- Discrepancies:
  - The code uses completely unconstrained placeholders IsCovering, pi1, and pi1_map. There is no connection to Mathlib definitions, nor any internal definition that captures the actual concepts. This is vacuous: pi1_map could be any function; the theorem would then (incorrectly) assert its injectivity from only IsCovering f and Hausdorff X, which is not faithful to the intended math statement.
  - No basepoint is specified, whereas the fundamental group is basepoint-dependent. While informal statements sometimes omit basepoints, a faithful formalization in Lean requires them or at least acknowledges that dependence. This is a significant mismatch.
  - No group structure is present (pi1 is just a type), though injectivity as a function does not require group structure; still, it abstracts away the ""group morphism"" aspect.
  - The predicate IsCovering is arbitrary and not Mathlib's covering map notion. There is no definition ensuring it actually means ""covering map"".

Step 3: Final check — are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem claims injectivity of an arbitrary function pi1_map f under an arbitrary predicate IsCovering and Hausdorff X. It does not ensure that pi1_map is the induced map on fundamental groups, nor that IsCovering represents covering maps, nor does it handle basepoints. Hence, the Lean statement is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The code uses vacuous placeholders and does not faithfully capture the intended mathematical content. It fails the translation.

- `theorem closure_diff_subset {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] (A B : Set X) : closure A \ closure B ⊆ closure (A \ B) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for any type `X` equipped with a topology, and any subsets `A, B : Set X`. The statement is: the set difference of the closure of `A` minus the closure of `B` is a subset of the closure of the set difference `A \ B`. Here `\` is set difference, `closure` is topological closure, and `⊆` is subset.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For a topological space `X` and subsets `A, B ⊆ X`, prove `\overline{A} - \overline{B} ⊆ \overline{A - B}`. This exactly matches the Lean statement: `closure A \ closure B ⊆ closure (A \ B)` for arbitrary `X` with a `TopologicalSpace` structure and `A, B : Set X`.
- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced; the theorem directly states the intended inclusion.
- Using `sorry` for the proof is acceptable for this auditing task; we only check the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same: both assert `closure A minus closure B` is contained in `closure (A minus B)` for subsets of a topological space. There are no generalizations or specializations beyond the original.

- `theorem boundary_eq_inter_closure_compl_extracted {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X} : frontier A = closure A ∩ closure (univ \ A) := by sorry`
  This states: For any type X equipped with a topological space structure, and any subset A of X, the topological boundary (frontier) of A equals the intersection of the closure of A and the closure of the complement of A in X. Here `(univ \ A)` denotes the complement of A in X (i.e., X \ A). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation purposes.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is: For a topological space X and subset A, ∂A = \overline{A} ∩ \overline{X − A}.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: `frontier A` is ∂A, `closure A` is \overline{A}, and `closure (univ \ A)` is \overline{X − A} since `univ \ A` is the complement of A in X. Thus, the theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced.
- `univ \ A` correctly represents `X − A` in this context.
- No change in generality or specialization; the statement is exactly the same.
- The presence of `sorry` does not affect the translation fidelity per the instructions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- universe u v; variables {X : Type u} {Y : Type v} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]: Work with arbitrary topological spaces X and Y.
- def CoveringMap (p : X → Y) : Prop := True: Defines “p is a covering map” as the proposition True. This is a vacuous placeholder: every map is a covering map by definition.
- def evenly_covered (p : X → Y) (U : Set Y) : Prop := True: Defines “U is evenly covered by p” as True. Again vacuous: every set is evenly covered.
- def num_sheets (p : X → Y) (U : Set Y) : Option Nat := none: Defines the number of sheets above U to be none (interpreted as ∞) for every p and U. This forces the number of sheets to be always ∞ and ignores actual structure.
- def PathConnected (Y : Type v) [TopologicalSpace Y] : Prop := True: Defines path connectedness as True. Vacuous: every space is path connected.
- namespace Covering ... end: Namespace wrapper.
- theorem sheets_equal_on_overlap ... : num_sheets p U = num_sheets p V := by sorry: States that if U and V are evenly covered and intersect nonemptily then the number of sheets agrees. With the above placeholders this would be trivially true since num_sheets is always none, but even the statement itself relies on vacuous predicates; moreover, it is left as sorry (no proof). The statement aims to express a standard overlap constancy result, but the supporting definitions are fake.
- theorem covering_map_n_to_one_of_path_connected ... : ∃ n, ∀ y, ∃ U, y ∈ U ∧ IsOpen U ∧ evenly_covered p U ∧ num_sheets p U = n := by sorry: States that if p is a covering map and Y is path connected, there exists a fixed number n (possibly ∞) such that every point has an open evenly covered neighborhood with exactly n sheets. Again, with placeholders this is vacuously satisfied by taking n = none and every U evenly covered, but the underlying definitions are fake and the proof is omitted.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement has two parts:
  a) The number of sheets above an evenly covered open set is constant along any path in Y.
  b) In particular, if Y is path connected, this number is constant across Y, so the covering map is n-to-1.
- The code does not include any notion of paths or a theorem asserting constancy along a path. It only includes an overlap-constancy lemma and a global path-connected conclusion (existence of n uniform across Y). The first, path-specific constancy claim is missing entirely as a formal statement.
- Moreover, all key notions (CoveringMap, evenly_covered, PathConnected) are defined as True, and num_sheets is hard-coded to be none. These are vacuous placeholders, not Mathlib’s genuine notions, and they trivialize the statements. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and not vacuous.
- Therefore, even setting aside the missing path statement, the translation is not faithful: it does not encode the genuine mathematical content.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Missing: A theorem that the number of sheets is constant along any path in Y.
- Vacuous definitions: CoveringMap, evenly_covered, PathConnected are all True; num_sheets is always none. This changes the meaning drastically and trivializes the results.
- The global path-connected corollary is stated, but relies on vacuous definitions and fixes n to ∞ implicitly, not reflecting the intended variability/constancy of n.
- Thus the Lean code does not faithfully formalize the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The auxiliary definitions are vacuous and one of the key claims (constancy along a path) is not even stated. If these were replaced by legitimate Mathlib definitions and the missing path-constancy theorem added, the overall shape could be reasonable; as is, it fails.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: X is a metric space and Γ is a group. This matches the context.
- is_group_action (act : Γ → X → X): This encodes the group action axioms explicitly: identity acts trivially and act (g*h) = act g ∘ act h. This is a reasonable custom definition of a group action.
- action_by_isometries: For each γ, the map x ↦ act γ x is an isometry. This matches “action by isometries.”
- is_free_action: ∀ γ x, act γ x = x → γ = 1. This matches “free action.”
- discrete_orbits: ∀ x γ, ∃ ε > 0 such that if dist(act δ x, act γ x) < ε then δ = γ. This states each orbit point γ • x is isolated in the orbit of x, i.e., orbits are discrete. This is a plausible formalization of “discrete orbits.”
- MyIsCoveringMap q := True and MyIsLocalIsometry q x := True: These are vacuous placeholder predicates and do not use mathlib’s actual notions of covering maps or local isometries. This is a major problem.
- Theorem quotient_map_locally_isometric_covering_map: Under the action hypotheses, it asserts the existence of some type Y and some map q : X → Y such that MyIsCoveringMap q and ∀ x, MyIsLocalIsometry q x. Because the predicates are True, the conclusion is vacuous. Moreover, the statement does not assert that Y is the quotient X/Γ or that q is the quotient map; it merely claims existence of some Y and q.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For a free isometric action of Γ on a metric space X with discrete orbits, the quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map.
- Discrepancies:
  1) The code does not refer to the quotient X/Γ at all; it merely claims there exists some Y and some q.
  2) The properties “covering map” and “local isometry” are replaced by vacuous placeholders equal to True, so the mathematical content is not captured.
  3) The theorem’s existential conclusion is far weaker and different in form from “the quotient map X → X/Γ has properties ...”.
- Even if the placeholders were replaced by genuine mathlib definitions, the theorem would still be unfaithful because it doesn’t state that q is the canonical quotient map to X/Γ.

Final check:
- The two problems are different. The Lean code uses vacuous definitions and does not assert anything about the quotient map or the quotient space X/Γ. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Grade justification:
- Vacuous placeholders are used, and even replacing them would not fix the mismatch (since the map/space are not specified as the quotient). According to the rubric, this aligns with a grade of 3.

The natural language statement: ""Suppose A, B are subsets of a topological space X. Prove that if A ⊆ B, then cl(A) ⊆ cl(B)."" The Lean theorem states exactly this, universally quantified over X with a TopologicalSpace structure and subsets A, B, with the implication that closure A is contained in closure B. This is a direct and faithful formalization.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification and assumptions match precisely.
- The use of Mathlib's `closure` and `⊆` are standard and correct.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The only omission is the proof (`sorry`), which is allowed in this auditing context and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

- `def fiber (p : X → Y) (y0 : Y) := { x : X // p x = y0 }`: The fiber of p over y0 is the subtype of points x in X with p x = y0. This is a faithful formalization of the fiber.
- Variables: `(p : X → Y) (y0 : Y) (pi1 : Type u) [Group pi1]`: We fix a map p, a point y0 in Y, and an arbitrary group pi1. Importantly, pi1 is not identified with any fundamental group; it's just any group.
- Placeholder hypotheses: `(is_covering : Prop) (path_connected : Prop) (locally_simply_connected : Prop)`: These are arbitrary propositions with no content tying them to p or Y. They are placeholders, not Mathlib notions of covering map, path connectedness, or local simple connectivity.
- The theorem:
  `theorem fundamental_group_acts_on_fibre_continuous : is_covering → path_connected → locally_simply_connected → ∃ (act : pi1 → fiber p y0 → fiber p y0), True := by sorry`
  This claims: assuming these three (uninterpreted) properties, there exists a function `act` from `pi1 × fiber p y0` to `fiber p y0`, and then asserts `True` (i.e., no further properties). There are no action axioms, no reference to continuity, no identification of pi1 with a fundamental group, and no relation to p being a covering beyond the placeholder `is_covering`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement (likely intended) says: For every covering map `p : X → Y` of a path connected, locally simply connected space `Y`, the fundamental group `π1(Y, y0)` acts on the fiber `p^{-1}(y0)` via the action induced by path lifting (denoted `[x]·[y] = [x*y]`), and this action is continuous.
- The code does not specify `π1(Y, y0)`; it uses an arbitrary group `pi1` with no connection to `Y`.
- The code does not assert a group action structure (no axioms like identity and compatibility), only the existence of a raw function.
- The code does not encode continuity (it places all expected properties under `True` as a placeholder and leaves a `sorry`).
- The code does not use Mathlib's notions of covering spaces, path connectedness, or local simple connectivity; it uses vacuous `Prop` placeholders not linked to `p` or `Y`.
- The described formula `[x]·[y] = [x*y]` is only mentioned in a comment and is not formalized in any way.
- Additionally, the natural language statement as typed says `π1(X, x0)` acts on `p^{-1}(x0)` for a covering `p : X → Y`, which is likely a typo (should be `π1(Y, x0)` acts on the fiber), but either way the Lean code does not commit to either; it uses an arbitrary `pi1`.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is a vacuous existence of some function from an arbitrary group to the fiber, with no action laws and no continuity, and with hypotheses that are arbitrary propositions. It does not faithfully formalize the statement about the fundamental group of the base acting via path lifting in a continuous way.

Discrepancies:
- `pi1` is arbitrary, not `π1(Y, y0)` (or `π1(X, x0)` as in the user's text).
- No action axioms provided.
- No continuity stated or proved.
- Hypotheses about covering, path connectedness, and local simple connectivity are placeholders, not linked to `p` or `Y`.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: Γ is a type with a group structure; X is a type with a metric space structure and a Γ-action (MulAction Γ X). This matches the natural language: a group Γ acts on a metric space X.

- is_isometric_action: ∀ γ x y, dist (γ • x) (γ • y) = dist x y. This says each group element acts by an isometry, exactly matching “Γ acts on X by isometries.”

- covering_action: ∀ x, ∃ r > 0, ∀ γ ≠ 1, ((fun y => γ • y) '' Metric.ball x r ∩ Metric.ball x r) = ∅. Interpreted: for each x there is a ball B = ball(x, r) such that for every nontrivial γ, γ(B) ∩ B = ∅. In group actions, this is equivalent to saying the translates of B by distinct group elements are pairwise disjoint, hence giving the standard local criterion for a covering action (in metric/topological terms, providing evenly covered neighborhoods). Using balls rather than arbitrary open sets is fine because any suitable open neighborhood contains a ball that inherits the disjointness property.

- free_action: ∀ γ ≠ 1, ∀ x, γ • x ≠ x. This is the usual definition of a free action.

- orbit (x): Set.range (fun γ => γ • x). This is the standard orbit of x under Γ.

- discrete_orbits: ∀ x y, y ∈ orbit x → ∃ r > 0, Metric.ball y r ∩ orbit x = {y}. This says each orbit is a discrete subset of X: around each orbit point y there is a ball that meets the orbit only at y.

- Theorem covering_action_iff_free_and_discrete_orbits (h_iso : is_isometric_action Γ X): covering_action Γ X ↔ (free_action Γ X ∧ discrete_orbits Γ X). Under the assumption that the action is by isometries, this states exactly the equivalence asked: the action is a covering action if and only if it is free and has discrete orbits.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural statement:
- The natural statement: “Suppose X is a metric space and Γ acts on X by isometries. Prove that Γ acts on X as a covering action iff the action is free with discrete orbits.”
- The Lean code encodes: X metric, Γ acts (MulAction), assumes isometries (is_isometric_action), defines covering action via disjointness of small balls and equivalently evenly covered neighborhoods, defines free and discrete orbits, and states the equivalence. This matches precisely.

Potential discrepancies checked:
- The definition of covering action via disjointness of a small ball with its nontrivial translates is a standard local criterion for covering actions in metric spaces; it implies pairwise disjointness of all translates and yields evenly covered neighborhoods. Using balls is not more restrictive since any open neighborhood contains a ball preserving the disjointness property.
- “Discrete orbits” is defined in the usual metric set sense and aligns with the natural language.
- No auxiliary definitions are vacuous; all are meaningful and standard.
- The hypothesis that the action is by isometries is included as a premise of the theorem, matching the natural statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It fixes a base field 𝕜 with structure [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜], which covers the usual cases like ℝ or ℂ for smooth manifolds.
- E and E' are finite-dimensional normed vector spaces over 𝕜 (with the appropriate normed group and normed space structures, and [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E], [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E']). These serve as the model vector spaces for the manifolds.
- H and H' are topological spaces, and I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H and I' : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H' are the model-with-corners structures, i.e., manifold models for M and M'.
- M and M' are types equipped with topologies and ChartedSpace structures over H and H', respectively. This is Mathlib’s way of encoding that M and M' are smooth manifolds modeled on E and E' via I and I'.
- f : M → M' is a function with hf : ContMDiff I I' (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞) f, i.e., f is smooth (C^∞) with respect to these manifold structures.
- h_dim : Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E' encodes dim M < dim M' (the manifold dimension equals the dimension of the model vector space), so this is the dimension inequality.
- The theorem conclusion IsNowhereDense (range f) asserts that the image of f, viewed as a subset of M', is nowhere dense in M'.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let φ: P → Q be a smooth map of manifolds with dim P < dim Q. Show φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.
- Lean statement matches this: M corresponds to P, M' to Q, f to φ; smoothness is captured by ContMDiff ... ⊤; the dimension inequality is encoded via Module.rank of the model spaces; and the conclusion IsNowhereDense (range f) exactly states that the image is nowhere dense in the codomain manifold.
- The use of ModelWithCorners and ChartedSpace is standard and appropriately general; allowing any nontrivially normed field 𝕜 slightly generalizes (e.g., ℝ or ℂ), which is acceptable.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- No vacuous definitions are introduced. There are no auxiliary fake constructs; the only proof is omitted via `sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions.
- The only presentational difference is that the smoothness level is expressed as ContMDiff with top order, and dimension comparison is via Module.rank on model spaces. Both are standard formalizations of the intended concepts.
- No substantive discrepancy: the Lean theorem statement faithfully expresses the original mathematical claim.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]` declares topological spaces X and Y, and assumes Y is locally compact and Hausdorff (T2).

- First declaration:
  `def closed_injective_is_homeomorphism_of_locally_compact_t2 (f : X → Y)
    (hf_closed : IsClosedMap f) (hf_inj : Function.Injective f) (hf_cont : Continuous f) :
    Homeomorph X (Set.range f) := by sorry`
  This states: given a function f from X to Y that is a closed map, injective, and continuous, and with Y locally compact Hausdorff, there exists a homeomorphism between X and the image of f (formalized as the subtype `Set.range f`). This precisely formalizes “any closed injective continuous map is a homeomorphism onto its image” under the ambient assumption on Y.

- Second declaration:
  `def proper_injective_is_homeomorphism_of_locally_compact_t2 (f : X → Y)
    (hf_proper : IsProperMap f) (hf_inj : Function.Injective f) (hf_cont : Continuous f) :
    Homeomorph X (Set.range f) := by sorry`
  This states: if f is a proper map (in Mathlib’s sense), injective, and continuous into a locally compact Hausdorff space Y, then there is a homeomorphism between X and `Set.range f`. This matches the “in particular” statement: proper injective maps (with the usual convention that “proper map” includes continuity) into a locally compact Hausdorff space are homeomorphisms onto their image.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The ambient assumptions `[LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]` exactly encode “Y is locally compact Hausdorff.”
- The first result assumes `IsClosedMap f` and `Function.Injective f`. It also explicitly assumes `Continuous f`. In typical mathematical language, when one says “closed injection f : X → Y” in this context, f is understood to be a continuous map that is injective and closed as a map. Thus adding `Continuous f` is a standard explicitness in formalization and does not change the intended statement.
- The conclusion is a `Homeomorph X (Set.range f)`, which is the precise Lean formalization of “a homeomorphism onto its image” (the image equipped with the subspace topology).
- The “in particular” part is formalized as a separate statement assuming `IsProperMap f`, along with injectivity and continuity, and gives the same homeomorphism conclusion. This matches the natural language corollary. In Mathlib, `IsProperMap f` is the standard notion of a proper (continuous) map, so the added `hf_cont` may be redundant but is harmless and faithful to the intent.

Checks for red flags:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions (e.g., no placeholders like `:= True`). The only “gaps” are proofs replaced with `by sorry`, which is acceptable per the task since we are only auditing the translation of the statement.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `IsClosedMap`, `IsProperMap`, `Continuous`, `Homeomorph`, `Set.range`, `T2Space`, `LocallyCompactSpace`.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statements faithfully represent the natural language claims, with the standard explicit addition of continuity. They capture exactly the intended theorems: closed injective continuous maps into a locally compact Hausdorff space are homeomorphisms onto their image; and, in particular, proper injective continuous maps are as well. No substantive discrepancy.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem name and docstring: It asserts that if Y has the coinduced (quotient) topology from a map f : X → Y and there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X such that f '' K = univ, then Y is compact.
- Parameters: {X Y : Type*} introduces the types. tX : TopologicalSpace X and tY : TopologicalSpace Y give topologies on X and Y. f : X → Y is a function. hf : Function.Surjective f states f is surjective. K : Set X is a subset of X. hK : IsCompact K means K is compact (as a subset of X). hKf : f '' K = univ says the image of K under f is all of Y. ht : tY = TopologicalSpace.coinduced f tX states Y’s topology is the coinduced (quotient) topology via f. 
- Conclusion: IsCompact (univ : Set Y), i.e., Y is compact as a topological space with topology tY.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), but we are only checking the statement/translation.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Suppose f : X → Y is surjective, and there exists a compact K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Prove Y is compact in the quotient topology.
The Lean theorem precisely encodes: f is surjective (hf); K is a compact subset of X (hK); f '' K = univ (hKf); Y’s topology is the coinduced (quotient) topology from f (ht); conclude Y is compact (IsCompact univ). This matches exactly. The theorem targets compactness of the whole space (IsCompact univ), which is the standard formalization of “Y is compact.”

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The Lean statement includes both hf : Surjective f and hKf : f '' K = univ. The latter already implies surjectivity, but the original statement also explicitly assumes surjectivity, so including both is consistent with the natural language.
- The natural language describes Y with the quotient topology; Lean encodes this as tY = coinduced f tX. This is faithful.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; just a single theorem statement. No red flags.
Thus the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

Line-by-line translation:
- import Mathlib: Brings in the Mathlib library.
- The comment explains the modeling choice: paths are continuous maps from the unit interval to X, and “defined” for concatenations is represented by the necessary endpoint equalities.
- open TopologicalSpace: Opens the namespace; not essential to content.
- theorem concat_defined_iff {X} [TopologicalSpace X] (f g h : C(↑unitInterval, X)) : (f.toFun 1 = g.toFun 0 ∧ g.toFun 1 = h.toFun 0) ↔ (f.toFun 1 = g.toFun 0 ∧ g.toFun 1 = h.toFun 0) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any topological space X and continuous paths f, g, h: [0,1] → X, the condition “f(1) = g(0) and g(1) = h(0)” is equivalent to itself.

Assessment vs the original statement:
- The original asks to prove: (x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.
- In standard topology, “(x*y)*z is defined” is equivalent to the endpoint equalities x(1) = y(0) and y(1) = z(0). Likewise, “x*(y*z) is defined” is equivalent to the same pair: x(1) = y(0) and y(1) = z(0), since (y*z)(0) = y(0) and (x*y)(1) = y(1). Hence the two conditions reduce to the same conjunction of endpoint equalities.
- The code chooses to formalize “defined” directly as this conjunction. It then states an iff between that same conjunction on both sides. While tautological, this is faithful to the mathematical content: both definability conditions reduce to the same predicate. No placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; no cheating.

Final check:
- The code does not explicitly define concatenation, but the comment makes clear the identification of “defined” with the endpoint-equality predicate, which is the correct reduction. The theorem, as written, matches the logical content of the natural-language claim.
- Minor technical note: writing f.toFun 1 and f.toFun 0 presumes 1 and 0 are usable as points of the unit interval type; this is a typing detail and does not affect the faithfulness of the translation.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful in meaning to the original statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Function`: Bring in Mathlib and open namespaces for sets and functions.
- Docstring: States the intended theorem: if f : X → Y is surjective, K ⊆ X is compact with f '' K = univ, and Y has the coinduced (quotient) topology from f, then Y is compact.
- `theorem quotient_compact_of_surjective_image {X Y : Type*} [tX : TopologicalSpace X] (f : X → Y) ...` introduces types X and Y, a topology on X, a map f : X → Y.
- `(hf : Function.Surjective f)`: f is surjective.
- `(K : Set X) (hK : IsCompact K)`: K is a subset of X and is compact.
- `(himage : f '' K = (Set.univ : Set Y))`: the image of K under f is all of Y (f(K) = Y).
- Conclusion: `@IsCompact Y (TopologicalSpace.coinduced f tX) (Set.univ : Set Y)`: with the coinduced (quotient) topology on Y induced by f from X, the set univ in Y is compact; i.e., Y is compact as a space.
- `by sorry`: proof omitted; acceptable for our translation check.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: Let f : X → Y be surjective. Suppose there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Equip Y with the quotient topology induced by f. Prove Y is compact.
- Lean matches each component:
  - f : X → Y surjective: `hf : Surjective f`.
  - Existence of compact K with f(K) = Y: `K : Set X`, `hK : IsCompact K`, `himage : f '' K = univ`.
  - Y equipped with quotient topology: `TopologicalSpace.coinduced f tX` on Y.
  - Conclusion that Y is compact: `IsCompact (univ : Set Y)` under that topology.
- Minor note: `himage : f '' K = univ` already implies surjectivity, so `hf` is redundant, but the natural language also stated surjectivity separately. Including both is fine and faithful.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies and vacuity.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (coinduced topology, IsCompact, image) are standard Mathlib.
- The topology on Y is explicitly the coinduced one from f, matching the ""quotient topology"" wording.
- The conclusion uses `IsCompact univ`, a standard formalization of ""Y is compact"".
- No mismatches or scope issues. The code is a faithful formalization of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- `theorem subset_closure_own {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] (A : Set X) : A ⊆ closure A := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: For any type `X` equipped with a topological space structure and any subset `A : Set X`, we have `A ⊆ closure A`. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is clear and standard.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: For a subset `A` of a topological space `X`, prove `A ⊆ overline(A)` (i.e., `A` is contained in its closure). The Lean statement exactly matches this: it universally quantifies over a topological space `X` and a subset `A : Set X`, and asserts `A ⊆ closure A`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The terms used (`TopologicalSpace`, `Set`, `closure`, and `⊆`) are standard Mathlib notions.

",5,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- We fix a group Γ and a metric space X with a Γ-action [MulAction Γ X]. We assume h_isometry: for every γ ∈ Γ, the map x ↦ γ • x is an isometry. This matches “a group action on a metric space X by a group of isometries.”
- We introduce an arbitrary proposition others : Prop.
- The main statement asserts an equivalence: (∀ x y : X, ∃ U V : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V ∧ Disjoint U V ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V ∧ (∀ γ, γ • U ⊆ U) ∧ (∀ γ, γ • V ⊆ V)) ↔ others. Here γ • U ⊆ U is expressed via Set.image (fun z => γ • z) U ⊆ U. Because the action is by a group (so maps are bijections), the condition “γ • U ⊆ U for all γ” implies actually γ • U = U, so this is a reasonable formalization of Γ-invariance.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The target condition “Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets” is captured by the left-hand side of the ↔, except the code quantifies over all pairs (x, y), including the case x = y. In standard topology, such separation statements mean distinct points; if x = y, it is impossible to find disjoint open sets both containing x, so the Lean statement is strictly stronger than intended. It should have required x ≠ y.
- More seriously, the equivalence is stated with an arbitrary others : Prop, which is a placeholder with no connection to the actual “other equivalent conditions.” The lemma claims equivalence with any proposition others, which is not a faithful formalization of “equivalent to the others.” One would need others to be a specific proposition encoding the other conditions; as written, it vastly overclaims.
- The isometry hypothesis is present as a parameter, matching the context, though it is not used in the statement beyond context.
- The notion of Γ-invariance via images ⊆ is acceptable here because of group invertibility, though equality would be more direct.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - Missing distinctness: The Lean code quantifies over all x, y, not just x ≠ y, making the condition unrealistically strong and typically false when x = y.
  - Vacuous/underdetermined “others”: The code uses an arbitrary Prop for “the others,” making the equivalence claim meaningless/unfaithful. It should specify the concrete other conditions.
  - Minor: invariance stated as subset rather than equality; acceptable given group structure.

Conclusion: Because of the arbitrary others and the missing x ≠ y condition, the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Universe and imports: `import Mathlib` and `open Set` are standard.
- Theorem header: `theorem benmckay_top_topology_335 {n : ℕ} (S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (x y : Fin n → ℝ) :` sets up a statement in ℝ^n (modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`), with a subset `S` and points `x, y`.
- Hypothesis (antecedent): `(∃ γ : ℝ → Fin n → ℝ, ContinuousOn γ (Icc (0:ℝ) 1) ∧ γ 0 = x ∧ γ 1 = y ∧ range γ ⊆ univ \ S)` says there exists a continuous path γ defined on ℝ but continuous on `[0,1]`, with endpoints x and y, and whose image lies in the complement of S. This encodes: “there exists a path in ℝ^n − S from x to y.”
- Conclusion (succedent): `∃ (m : ℕ) (v : Fin (m+1) → Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, v i ∈ S)` states: there exist a natural number m and a tuple of m+1 points v, all lying in S. No relation to x, y, any path, or path properties.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: “Let S ⊂ ℝ^n be a subset. Prove that the shortest path from x to y in ℝ^n − S is a polygon with corners on S whenever this makes sense.” Key components:
  - It involves a shortest path (existence and optimality criterion).
  - The path lies entirely in ℝ^n − S.
  - The minimizing path can be taken to be polygonal (piecewise linear).
  - The corners (vertices) lie on S (likely the boundary of S, since the path must avoid S).
  - “Whenever this makes sense” refers to cases where a shortest path exists.

Discrepancies:
- The Lean statement does not mention “shortest” or any optimization/minimization of length.
- It does not assert that there exists a polygonal path, nor define a polygon or piecewise-linear path.
- It does not tie the listed vertices v to a path from x to y, or to any path at all.
- It asserts all vertices are in S, not on the boundary; and allows no guarantee the path avoids S or even exists.
- The conclusion is extremely weak: from the existence of a path avoiding S, it concludes existence of finitely many points in S. This can even be false if S is empty, and in any case is unrelated to polygonal shortest paths.
- The antecedent only asserts existence of some path avoiding S, not existence of a shortest one. This is a major mismatch with the original claim.

Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code’s conclusion is unrelated to the original claim about shortest paths being polygonal with corners on S. It omits optimality, polygonality, relation to x and y, and staying in ℝ^n − S. It merely asserts the existence of a finite list of points in S, which does not capture the original statement at any level.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `universe u v`: Introduces universe levels for types S and G.
- `noncomputable def freeGroup_lift_equiv {S : Type u} {G : Type v} [Group G] : (S → G) ≃ (FreeGroup S →* G) := by sorry`
  This declares (noncomputably) an equivalence (a bijection) between the set of functions from S to a group G and the set of group homomorphisms from the free group on S to G. The body is `by sorry`, i.e., the implementation is omitted.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts the universal property of the free group: every function f : S → G uniquely extends to a group homomorphism φ : FreeGroup S →* G such that φ(of s) = f s for all s ∈ S, i.e., it maps generators to their images under f and extends to all words.
- The Lean statement claims there is an equivalence `(S → G) ≃ (FreeGroup S →* G)`. As a mathematical formulation, this encapsulates the existence and uniqueness of such extensions (there is exactly one homomorphism per function), which is a standard, equivalent way to state the universal property.
- However, the Lean statement does not mention or enforce the compatibility with the inclusion of generators `FreeGroup.of : S → FreeGroup S` (i.e., it does not assert φ ∘ of = f). An arbitrary equivalence between these sets would not necessarily encode the intended correspondence that sends f to its unique extension agreeing with f on generators. Usually, one also states or proves that the equivalence is given by `FreeGroup.lift` and that `lift f (of s) = f s`. None of this is present in the type; it's only hinted in the docstring, which is not formal.

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- The high-level content (bijection between functions and homomorphisms) matches the universal property in spirit and is a common formalization. But the code, as stated, does not include the crucial property relating the equivalence to the generator map `of`, so it omits an essential part of the natural language statement (“mapping each s to f(s)”).
- Moreover, the definition is given with `by sorry`, which is a vacuous placeholder: the equivalence is asserted without construction. Per the auditing guidelines, a definition filled with `sorry` counts as a vacuous/placeholder component and causes the translation to fail.

Conclusion: While the target type `(S → G) ≃ (FreeGroup S →* G)` is essentially the right mathematical statement for the universal property, the code is not faithful because (a) it uses `sorry` to define the equivalence, and (b) it does not formally state the compatibility with generators that the natural language emphasizes. If the `sorry` were replaced by the canonical equivalence built from `FreeGroup.lift` along with accompanying simp/characterization lemmas, it would be faithful.

- `def is_covering_map (f : X → Y) : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate named `is_covering_map` on functions between topological spaces, but defines it to be `True` for every function. This is a placeholder: it asserts that every map is a covering map.

The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If X → Y and Y → Z are covering maps (in the genuine topological sense), then X → Z is a covering map. This is a standard composition property for covering maps.
- The Lean code’s statement mirrors the shape of the claim (composition preserves the property), but it relies on a vacuous placeholder definition `is_covering_map := True`. Thus, it does not capture the actual topological notion of a covering map, nor any of its required conditions (continuity, surjectivity, local triviality/even covering).

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- The Lean code defines every map as a covering map, making the theorem trivially true and unrelated to the substantive content of the original theorem. Therefore, although the syntactic form matches, the semantic content does not. There are no legitimate auxiliary definitions modeling covering maps, so the translation is not faithful.

Given the rubric: This uses a vacuous definition. If that were replaced by a proper definition of covering maps, the theorem statement would match the natural language claim. Hence it earns a mid score for being structurally aligned but semantically vacuous.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: X, Y, Z are types with topological space structures.
- snd_comp : C(Y, Z) → C(X × Y, Z) is defined as precomposition with the second projection Prod.snd. Concretely, it sends a continuous f : Y → Z to the continuous map (x, y) ↦ f(y), i.e., a map that depends only on y.
- is_constant_on_X_fiber (h : C(X × Y, Z)) : Prop is the predicate that for all x1, x2, y, h (x1, y) = h (x2, y). This means h is independent of x, i.e., constant along the fibers X × {y}.
- Theorem snd_comp_range_eq: The range (image) of snd_comp equals the set of continuous maps X × Y → Z that are constant on X-fibers (i.e., independent of x). In words: the functions obtained by precomposing with the second projection are exactly those functions on X × Y that do not depend on the X-coordinate.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Suppose X and Y are topological spaces and A ⊂ X is dense. Prove that the inclusion of C(Y) → C(X × Y) is an isomorphism onto the functions which are constant on each set {x} × Y with x ∈ X.""
- Immediate issues:
  - The statement mentions a dense subset A ⊂ X, but A is not used thereafter. The Lean code does not mention A at all.
  - The inclusion C(Y) → C(X × Y) via the second projection yields functions that are independent of the X-variable, i.e., constant on sets of the form X × {y}. However, the natural language statement says ""constant on each set {x} × Y"", which means independent of the Y-variable (i.e., functions depending only on x). That would correspond to the inclusion C(X) → C(X × Y) via the first projection, not C(Y).
  - Thus, the Lean code characterizes the image as functions constant on X × {y} (independent of x), while the natural language statement asks for constant on {x} × Y (independent of y). These are swapped.
  - The code also generalizes the codomain to arbitrary Z (C(Y, Z)), while the natural language uses the notation C(·) typically for scalar-valued continuous functions. This generalization is acceptable.
  - Additionally, the natural language says ""is an isomorphism onto"" which suggests a bijection between C(Y) and that subset. The code only states equality of the range with a subset, not injectivity. Injectivity of precomposition by Prod.snd fails if X is empty. The code avoids discussing isomorphism/bijection, only the image characterization.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different:
  - The direction of constancy is reversed: code handles constancy along X × {y} (independent of x), while the statement says constancy along {x} × Y (independent of y).
  - The dense subset A is mentioned in the statement but unused in the code (and arguably unused in the statement too).
  - The code proves an image characterization, not an explicit isomorphism claim or injectivity conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is closely related in spirit (characterizing the image of the inclusion via a projection), but it does not faithfully translate the given natural language statement due to the swapped fiber and the unused density hypothesis.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem universal_cover_unique_up_to_iso {X Y Z : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z] {f : X → Y} {g : Z → Y}`: We have topological spaces X, Y, Z and continuous maps f: X → Y and g: Z → Y.
- `(hf : IsCoveringMap f) (hg : IsCoveringMap g)`: f and g are covering maps.
- `(hX : SimplyConnectedSpace X) (hZ : SimplyConnectedSpace Z)`: X and Z are simply connected spaces.
- `: ∃! (h : Homeomorph X Z), g ∘ (h : X → Z) = f`: There exists a unique homeomorphism h: X ≃ Z such that g ∘ h = f (i.e., the triangle over Y commutes). The coercion `(h : X → Z)` uses the underlying function of the homeomorphism.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: Given X → Y and Z → Y are universal covering maps, conclude X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y; equivalently, there is a unique map X → Z over Y making the triangle commute.
- In standard usage, a universal cover is a simply connected covering space. The Lean hypotheses `IsCoveringMap f`, `IsCoveringMap g`, and `SimplyConnectedSpace X`, `SimplyConnectedSpace Z` match that characterization.
- The conclusion in Lean asserts the existence and uniqueness of a homeomorphism h over Y, i.e., an isomorphism of coverings. This matches the phrase “isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y.” The equality `g ∘ h = f` is exactly the commuting triangle condition. The uniqueness is phrased among homeomorphisms, which aligns with “unique isomorphism over Y.”

Final comparison:
- The code makes no vacuous or placeholder definitions; it relies on Mathlib’s `IsCoveringMap`, `SimplyConnectedSpace`, and `Homeomorph`.
- The statement is essentially identical to the natural language claim: universal covers (simply connected covering maps) over the same base are uniquely isomorphic over the base, with the commuting triangle.
- Minor technical nuances (e.g., additional conditions on Y often assumed in textbooks, or whether surjectivity is built into `IsCoveringMap`) do not affect the faithfulness of the translation to the given statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The equality is exactly as stated: closure (A ∪ B) = closure A ∪ closure B.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language and assess.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but nothing from it is actually used in the definitions.
- universe u v: Universe levels; fine.
- structure CoveringMap (X : Type u) (Y : Type v): A custom structure intended to encode a covering map between types X and Y. Fields:
  - to_fun : X → Y: the projection map.
  - is_covering : Prop: an unspecified property stating ""is a covering""; no actual definition or linkage to topological notions.
  - basepoint : X: chosen basepoint in X.
  - targetpoint : Y: a chosen point in Y (presumably y0) but not linked to the map.
  - is_universal : Prop: an unspecified property stating ""is universal""; again no definition.
  This is a bespoke, non-mathlib structure that does not encode topologies, Hausdorffness, or the covering space property. Fields are just opaque propositions with no semantics.
- structure Morphism {X} {Y} (f : CoveringMap X Y) {Z} (g : CoveringMap Z Y): A morphism between the total spaces over the same base Y. Fields:
  - map : X → Z.
  - map_basepoint : map f.basepoint = g.basepoint.
  - commute : g.to_fun ∘ map = f.to_fun.
  This matches the idea of a morphism of pointed covers (commuting with projections and preserving basepoints), but there is no constraint linking basepoints to target points (e.g., f.to_fun f.basepoint = y0), nor any topology.
- theorem universal_covering_map_iff_unique_factor (f : CoveringMap X Y) : f.is_universal ↔ (∀ {Z} (g : CoveringMap Z Y), ∃! (h : Morphism f g), True) := by sorry
  This asserts: f is universal iff for every cover g over Y, there exists a unique morphism h from f to g. The uniqueness predicate uses ∃! h, True, i.e., uniqueness of Morphism h without any further condition. That part encodes “has a unique morphism” correctly.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Original statement: Assume Y is a Hausdorff topological space which admits a universal cover. Prove that a covering map (X, x0) → (Y, y0) is universal iff every covering map (Z, z0) → (Y, y0) has a unique morphism (X, x0) → (Z, z0).

Discrepancies:
- No topology: The Lean code does not model topological spaces, Hausdorffness, or covering maps as in Mathlib. is_covering and is_universal are opaque Props, not definitions.
- Not using Mathlib’s covering spaces: A custom placeholder structure is used; this is a red flag per the guidelines.
- Missing assumptions: The Lean theorem includes no assumptions about Y being Hausdorff or admitting a universal covering space. The natural language statement explicitly assumes these (even if the equivalence might hold more generally, the translation omits them entirely).
- Pointed structure mismatch:
  - The code has basepoint and targetpoint fields but does not enforce that f.to_fun f.basepoint = f.targetpoint (i.e., that the cover is pointed over y0) or that different covers g have the same target basepoint as f.
  - The quantification over g : CoveringMap Z Y does not restrict to those with the same targetpoint y0 as f. The morphism only aligns basepoints X → Z, not target points Y.
- The theorem equates an opaque field f.is_universal with the unique factorization property. Without a definition of is_universal, this is essentially asserting the universal property as the definition, rather than showing equivalence.

Step 3: Final check: Are the math problems the same?
They are different in several material ways:
- The Lean code uses a non-mathlib, underspecified notion of covering map and universality (opaque Props), lacking any topological structure.
- It omits the Hausdorff and existence assumptions.
- It fails to enforce the pointed condition relative to y0 on Y and does not ensure covers share the same y0.
- The uniqueness statement uses a trivial predicate True in ∃!, which is fine for encoding uniqueness of morphisms, but the surrounding context is too weak to be faithful.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful under the guidelines. The core universal property shape is present, but the surrounding structure is so underspecified and missing key hypotheses that it does not legitimately formalize the original statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `def pi1 (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] (x0 : X) : Type (max u v) := PUnit`
  This defines a placeholder for the fundamental group: for any topological space X with basepoint x0, pi1 X x0 is defined to be PUnit, the one-element type. This means every fundamental group is (by definition here) trivial. This is an explicitly vacuous stand-in, not the actual fundamental group from Mathlib.

- `def pi1_prod ... : pi1 (X × Y) (x0, y0) ≃ pi1 X x0 × pi1 Y y0 := by sorry`
  This declares (with a `sorry` placeholder) an equivalence of types between pi1 of the product and the product of pi1s. Given the previous placeholder, this becomes an equivalence PUnit ≃ (PUnit × PUnit), which is true but only because of the trivialization, not because of the real mathematical content.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement asserts a group isomorphism π1(X×Y,(x0,y0)) ≅ π1(X,x0) × π1(Y,y0). This is about groups and their product, not just sets/types. The code:
- Replaces the fundamental group with a trivial type PUnit, which is a vacuous, non-faithful stand-in for the actual fundamental group. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous.
- States a type equivalence `≃` rather than a group isomorphism (e.g., `≃*` for groups or an isomorphism in GroupCat). Even if pi1 were correctly defined as a group, the code only claims a bijection of underlying types, not a group isomorphism, so it would still be weaker than the intended statement.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
They are not.
- The code’s `pi1` is PUnit for every space, trivializing the problem. The resulting statement PUnit ≃ PUnit × PUnit bears little relation to the nontrivial group-theoretic statement about fundamental groups.
- The result is presented as a type equivalence, not a group isomorphism, which is strictly weaker and misses the algebraic structure central to the theorem.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It uses a vacuous placeholder for the fundamental group, and even the form of the conclusion (type equivalence vs group isomorphism) does not match the natural language statement.

- The Lean statement matches exactly: A is an invertible linear map on ℝ^n, and there exist eigenpairs with eigenvalues > 1 and < -1; conclude A is a covering map.
- Representing ℝ^n as `(Fin n → ℝ)` and a matrix as a linear equivalence is standard and faithful.
- The eigenvalue/eigenvector condition is expressed explicitly via `∃ v ≠ 0, A v = λ • v`, which is the standard eigenvector equation in Lean and is faithful to the notion of eigenvalue.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No mismatch in quantifiers or types: the code handles exactly ℝ^n and a real linear equivalence.
- The eigenvalue conditions are precisely as in the natural language (one > 1, one < -1).
- Slight extra generality or restriction? None; the statement is neither broadened nor weakened.
- The use of `IsCoveringMap` is the correct mathlib notion (the code is stated to compile, so the identifier is valid).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def is_Gamma_covering {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {Y : Type*} (p : Y → X) : Prop := True`
  This introduces a predicate ""is_Gamma_covering"" for a map p : Y → X, but it is defined to be always True. It is a vacuous placeholder and does not encode any covering space structure, action, or Γ-structure.

- `theorem benmckay_top_covering_spaces_856 ... : is_Gamma_covering (pφ : Xφ → X) := by sorry`
  Hypotheses:
  - `X : Type*` with `[TopologicalSpace X]` (a topological space),
  - `Γ : Type*` with `[Group Γ]` (a group),
  - `π1X : Type*` with `[Group π1X]` (some group, not tied to X’s fundamental group),
  - `φ : π1X → Γ` (a plain function, not declared as a group homomorphism),
  - `Xφ : Type*`, `pφ : Xφ → X` (a map between types),
  - `action : Γ → Xφ → Xφ` (a bare function, not a structured group action).
  Conclusion: `is_Gamma_covering pφ`, which, since `is_Gamma_covering` is defined as `True`, is a vacuous statement. There are no assumptions about path-connectedness, local simple connectedness, connectedness of the covering space, or any relation between `π1X` and the fundamental group of `X`. There is no claim about `Γ ≅ π₁(X)` and no classification part for all connected Γ-coverings.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement asserts a deep classification: given X path connected and locally simply connected, a group Γ, and a group homomorphism φ : π₁(X) → Γ, with a Γ-action on a space X_φ producing a map p_φ : X_φ → X, then (1) p_φ is a Γ-covering, (2) Γ ≅ π₁(X), and (3) any connected Γ-covering Y → X arises from such a φ. These require genuine notions: fundamental group π₁(X) of X, group homomorphism, Γ-action, covering space structure, and a classification statement.
- The Lean code:
  - Replaces π₁(X) by an arbitrary group `π1X` unrelated to X,
  - Uses a plain function `φ : π1X → Γ` rather than a group homomorphism,
  - Uses an unstructured `action : Γ → Xφ → Xφ` rather than a (topological) group action,
  - Introduces a placeholder predicate `is_Gamma_covering := True`, making the conclusion vacuous,
  - Omits all the key hypotheses (path connectedness, locally simply connected),
  - Omits the isomorphism `Γ ≅ π₁(X)` entirely,
  - Omits the classification statement that any connected Γ-covering arises from some φ.

Final check:
- The Lean statement is not a faithful formalization; it is vastly weaker, with vacuous definitions and missing core content. Even if `is_Gamma_covering` were replaced by a correct definition, the theorem’s statement would still not match the original due to missing assumptions, lack of the isomorphism, lack of connectedness/classification conclusions, and failure to identify `π1X` with π₁(X) or `φ` as a homomorphism.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports Mathlib and opens namespaces MulAction and Set.
- Declares a group Γ and a topological space X with a Γ-action (MulAction Γ X). These initial variables are later overshadowed by the theorem's parameters, so they're not essential.
- The theorem statement:
  • Context/assumptions inside the theorem: {Γ : Type*} [Group Γ] [TopologicalSpace Γ] [IsTopologicalGroup Γ] and {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [MulAction Γ X] [ContinuousSMul Γ X]. So Γ is a topological group and acts continuously on the topological space X.
  • Hypothesis h: CompactSpace (Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X)). This means the orbit space X/Γ (the set of orbits with the quotient topology) is compact.
  • Conclusion is a conjunction of two statements:
    1) ∀ x : X, ∃ y ∈ MulAction.orbit Γ x, IsCompact ((MulAction.stabilizer Γ y : Set Γ)). For every x in X, there exists a point y in the orbit Γ · x whose stabilizer subgroup in Γ, viewed as a subset of Γ, is compact.
    2) ∃ (K : Set X), IsCompact K ∧ ∀ x : X, (K ∩ MulAction.orbit Γ x).Nonempty. There exists a compact subset K of X that intersects every Γ-orbit.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If a group Γ acts on a topological space X and X/Γ is compact, prove that every orbit Γ x ⊆ X contains a point x with compact stabilizer, and moreover that X contains a compact set intersecting every Γ-orbit.
- The Lean hypothesis “CompactSpace (Quotient (MulAction.orbitRel Γ X))” precisely formalizes “X/Γ is compact.” The quotient used is the orbit space, matching X/Γ.
- The first conclusion matches “every orbit contains a point with compact stabilizer”: for each orbit (represented by x), there exists y in that orbit such that the stabilizer of y is compact (as a subset of Γ).
- The second conclusion matches “X contains a compact set intersecting every Γ-orbit”: existence of compact K with K ∩ orbit(x) ≠ ∅ for all x.

Potential differences and whether they matter:
- The Lean statement assumes Γ is a topological group and the action is continuous ([ContinuousSMul Γ X]). The natural language statement did not explicitly specify a topology on Γ or continuity. However, talking about “compact stabilizer” necessarily presupposes a topology on Γ, and in standard mathematical usage for such results, Γ is a topological group and the action is continuous. Thus, the Lean hypotheses are a natural and reasonable formalization rather than an unrelated strengthening.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts (orbitRel, stabilizer, IsCompact, CompactSpace) are standard from Mathlib.

Final check:
- The theorem statement in Lean faithfully translates the two claims in the natural language statement under the standard topological assumptions needed to make the claims meaningful. No mismatches in quantifiers or objects. Minor strengthening (topological group and continuous action) is appropriate and standard for the claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `theorem is_compact_Icc_real {a b : ℝ} (h : a ≤ b) : IsCompact (Set.Icc a b) := by sorry`: States that for real numbers `a` and `b`, assuming `a ≤ b`, the set `Set.Icc a b` (the closed interval [a, b] in ℝ) is compact. `IsCompact` is Mathlib's standard notion of compactness for subsets of topological spaces.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: ""Prove that [a,b] ⊂ ℝ is compact for any a ≤ b."" The Lean theorem asserts exactly that: given `a ≤ b`, the closed interval `[a, b]` in ℝ is compact. The set involved is indeed a subset of ℝ, and the compactness predicate is the standard one.

3) Final check for differences:
- Both the Lean statement and the natural language statement require `a ≤ b`. While in fact compactness holds even without this hypothesis (since the empty set is compact), including `a ≤ b` matches the natural language and does not weaken it. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The code is a direct formalization of the statement without extraneous changes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X C Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace C] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We have three types X, C, Y equipped with topological space structures.
- The theorem `deck_preserves_path_lift` is stated with parameters:
  - `path_connected : Prop` and `locally_simply_connected : Prop`: arbitrary propositions, not tied to X or used in the statement (they are not assumptions like `[PathConnectedSpace X]` or similar—just bare Props and unused).
  - `p : C → X`: a function intended to be the covering projection, but no assumption it is a covering map.
  - `f : C → C`: a function intended to be a deck transformation; only hypothesis is `hf : p ∘ f = p` (i.e., it preserves the projection). No assumption that `f` is a homeomorphism.
  - `γ : Y → X`: a function intended to be a path; but Y is an arbitrary topological space (not the unit interval), and no continuity or endpoint conditions are assumed.
  - `tildeγ : Y → C`: a function intended to be a lift of γ; the only hypothesis is `h : p ∘ tildeγ = γ` (no continuity assumed).
  - Conclusion: `p ∘ (f ∘ tildeγ) = γ`. This follows immediately from associativity of composition and the equalities `hf` and `h`.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For any path connected and locally simply connected topological space X, a homeomorphism of the total space preserving the covering map (a deck transformation) takes any lift of a path to a lift of the same path.
- Missing/altered components in the Lean code:
  - Path connectedness and local simple connectivity of X: not encoded; instead there are two arbitrary Props not linked to X and unused.
  - Covering map: not assumed for p.
  - Deck transformation: in topology a deck transformation is a homeomorphism commuting with p; here f is just a function with `p ∘ f = p`, no homeomorphism structure.
  - Path: γ is any function Y → X (Y arbitrary), no requirement that Y = Icc (or use of `Path`), and no continuity.
  - Lift: in topology typically requires continuity and the composition property; here only the algebraic composition equality is used.
- The code proves only the trivial algebraic fact: if `p ∘ f = p` and `p ∘ tildeγ = γ`, then `p ∘ (f ∘ tildeγ) = γ`. It does not address homeomorphism, continuity, or path domain. The hypotheses about path connectedness and local simple connectivity are irrelevant in the code and not connected to X.

3) Final judgment:
- The formal statement is a drastic weakening of the original theorem, omitting essential topological content (homeomorphism, covering, path/continuity/domain). The presence of unused `Prop` parameters labeled as path-connected and locally simply connected is a red flag. While the conclusion matches the bare compositional property, the intended topological meaning of “deck transformation” and “lift of a path” is not captured. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The theorem `isNowhereDense_range_of_cont_mdiff_dim_lt` states: Let 𝕜 be a nontrivially normed field. Let E, E' be finite-dimensional normed vector spaces over 𝕜, and let H, H' be model spaces with model-with-corners structures I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H and I' : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H'. Let M and M' be manifolds charted by H and H', respectively. If f : M → M' is smooth (ContMDiff of all orders), and the model dimensions satisfy Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E' (i.e., dim M < dim M'), then the image range f is nowhere dense in M'.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions: ContMDiff, ModelWithCorners, IsNowhereDense, etc. The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only judge the statement.

Step 2: Compare with the original natural language statement.
- Original: Let φ : P → Q be a smooth map of manifolds with dim P = dim Q. Show there is a dense set of points p₀ ∈ P such that φ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of each such p₀.
- Code: Assumes dim M < dim M' (strict inequality), and concludes that the image range f is nowhere dense in the target. No statement about equal dimensions, no claim about a dense subset of the domain, and no local diffeomorphism conclusion.

Step 3: Final check.
- The two problems are different in both hypotheses and conclusions. The code addresses a different phenomenon (image of a lower-dimensional smooth map is nowhere dense), whereas the target statement concerns generic local diffeomorphism points in the equal-dimension case. Thus the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are made; all terms are legitimate Mathlib concepts.
- Despite being in the same general area (smooth maps between manifolds, dimension comparisons), the mismatch is substantial.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The file imports Mathlib and opens Function (for Injective).
- Comment explains the intended formalization: use the coinduced (final) topology on Y from a map P : X → Y, and state that Y is Hausdorff (T2) iff P is injective. Proofs are omitted with sorry.

- Theorem `coinduced_t2_iff_injective {X Y} (P : X → Y) (t : TopologicalSpace X)`:
  This states: Equip Y with the coinduced (final) topology along P from the given topology t on X. Then Y is a T2 (Hausdorff) space if and only if P is injective.

- Theorem `final_topology_from_family_t2_iff_injective {I} (X_i : I → Type _) (f : ∀ i, X_i i → Y) (t : TopologicalSpace (Σ i, X_i i))`:
  This specializes to a family: take the disjoint union Σ i, X_i i with some topology t, and the canonical map P : Σ i, X_i i → Y given by P ⟨i, x⟩ = f i x. Equip Y with the coinduced (final) topology from this P. Then Y is T2 iff this canonical map P is injective.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Y has the final topology from a family of maps f_i : X_i → Y (i ∈ I). Prove that Y is Hausdorff if and only if there exists a topological space X and a map P : X → Y that includes all the f_i (i.e., factors them) and P is injective.
- The code uses exactly the coinduced (final) topology on Y. The second theorem captures the family by taking X to be the disjoint union Σ i, X_i i and P the canonical map induced by the family f_i. This corresponds to “includes all f_i” (since P ∘ in_i = f_i). The statement asserted is precisely “Y (with that final topology) is Hausdorff iff P is injective.”
- Although the code does not assign topologies individually to each X_i, it instead takes a topology t on the sigma type (Σ i, X_i i). This is a standard way to encode the final topology from the family: one typically takes t to be the coproduct topology arising from the given topologies on each X_i. The theorem is stated for an arbitrary topology t on the sigma, which is a slight generalization that still subsumes the intended case.
- The first theorem is a general form for an arbitrary P : X → Y and topology t on X; the second theorem is the specialization to the family case. Both are faithful to the intended meaning of the English statement, with the second one directly addressing the “includes all f_i” via the sigma construction.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions `TopologicalSpace.coinduced`, `T2Space`, and `Function.Injective` are used.
- Proofs are omitted via sorry, which is acceptable for the stated auditing task.
- The only potential nuance is that the code uses an arbitrary topology on the sigma type rather than explicitly building it from topologies on each X_i; however, this is a harmless generalization since the intended case is included by choosing t to be the coproduct topology. The equivalence stated matches the English claim in meaning.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- theorem quotient_metric_space_condition : True := by sorry: Declares a theorem whose statement is literally True, with a placeholder proof. This contains no content about the quotient metric, topology, or equivalence of conditions.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The natural statement: For a group action by isometries on a metric space X, prove that a certain condition is equivalent to the others, namely that the quotient space is a metric space under the quotient metric d(\bar{x},\bar{y}) = inf_{g ∈ Γ} d(gx, y), and that this metric topology agrees with the quotient topology.

The code does none of the following:
- It does not assume the action is by isometries (no [IsometricSMul Γ X] or equivalent isometry condition).
- It does not define the quotient space (e.g., Quot X (orbit relation) or a set of orbits), nor any metric on it.
- It does not define or reference the quotient topology, nor compare it to a metric topology.
- It does not state any equivalence of conditions. The only theorem is the vacuous statement True.

The only relevant auxiliary definition, orbit_rel, is standard but unused and insufficient.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are different. The math statement concerns a specific metric construction on the quotient under an isometric group action and the agreement of topologies, possibly as one of several equivalent conditions. The Lean code has no such content; it does not even state a related proposition. Moreover, it lacks the key hypothesis that the action is by isometries.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

2) Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original statement has two parts:
  a) Associativity up to homotopy relative to {0,1}: (x*y)*z is homotopic rel endpoints to x*(y*z).
  b) Definedness equivalence: (x*y)*z is defined if and only if x*(y*z) is defined.
- The provided Lean code addresses only (part of) (b), and even there it does so in a trivial, tautological way: it states an equivalence between identical conjunctions (A ∧ B) ↔ (A ∧ B), without ever defining concatenation or tying the conjunctions explicitly to the definedness of (f*g)*h or f*(g*h). There is no formal definition of concatenation or of ""definedness"" as a predicate; nor is there any statement about homotopy relative to {0,1}.
- Thus, the main content (associativity up to homotopy rel {0,1}) is completely missing, and the definedness equivalence is reduced to a tautology with no connection to concatenation itself.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement only asserts (A ∧ B) ↔ (A ∧ B) for endpoint equalities of f, g, h (and even leaves it unproved with sorry). It does not define concatenation, does not relate those equalities to the definedness of (f*g)*h and f*(g*h), and says nothing about homotopy relative to {0,1}. The original asks for the associativity up to homotopy and the equivalence of definedness. The former is entirely missing; the latter is only implicitly intended via a tautology and not formalized via concatenation predicates.

Additional minor technical concern: writing `f.toFun 1` and `g.toFun 0` presumes `1` and `0` are coerced to elements of the unit interval type; typically one needs `⟨0, ...⟩` and `⟨1, ...⟩` or provided lemmas. But regardless, the main faithfulness issue remains: the core homotopy statement is absent.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the original statement.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable (Z : Set Complex) (g : Complex → Complex)`: Introduces a subset Z of the complex numbers and a function g from C to C (not restricted to Z).
- `variable (Z_is_domain : Prop) (g_is_analytic : Prop) (loops_nullhomotopic : Prop)`: Introduces three arbitrary proposition variables intended to represent “Z is a domain,” “g is analytic,” and “g maps every loop in Z to a null-homotopic loop in C \ {0},” respectively. These are mere placeholders with no mathematical content attached.
- `theorem analytic_log_exists_iff : (∃ G : Complex → Complex, (∀ z, z ∈ Z → g z = Complex.exp (G z)) ∧ g_is_analytic) ↔ ((∀ z, z ∈ Z → g z ≠ 0) ∧ loops_nullhomotopic) := by sorry`: States an equivalence between (left) the existence of some function G : C → C such that for all z ∈ Z, g z = exp(G z), together with the proposition g_is_analytic, and (right) the conjunction that g(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Z and the proposition loops_nullhomotopic. There is no requirement that G is analytic; g_is_analytic is an arbitrary Prop, and loops_nullhomotopic is an arbitrary Prop, both unrelated to g unless further specified.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- The original statement assumes: Z ⊂ C is a domain (open and connected) and g : Z → C is complex analytic on Z. The code instead:
  - Takes g : C → C and only restricts via hypotheses z ∈ Z in quantifications. This might be acceptable as a modeling choice, but...
  - Does not encode analyticity at all; it uses an arbitrary Prop `g_is_analytic` that is not tied to Mathlib’s notions (e.g., `AnalyticOn`, `HolomorphicOn`, etc.).
  - Does not encode that Z is a domain; it introduces `Z_is_domain : Prop` but never uses it.
- The original defines a logarithm as an analytic function G : Z → C with g = exp ∘ G on Z. The code only requires existence of some G : C → C with the equality on Z; it does not require G to be analytic, nor even restricts its domain to Z.
- The loop condition in the original is: g maps every loop in Z to a null-homotopic loop in C \ {0}. The code replaces this with a bare Prop `loops_nullhomotopic` that is not defined in terms of g, Z, or any topological notions. So the code does not formalize the homotopy condition at all.
- Structural mismatch: In the original, the assumptions “Z is a domain” and “g is analytic on Z” are hypotheses of the theorem, i.e., standing assumptions under which the equivalence holds. In the code, `g_is_analytic` appears only on the left side of the equivalence (conjoined with the existence of G), and `Z_is_domain` is not used anywhere. Thus, even if the placeholders were replaced by proper definitions, the logical structure would remain incorrect (it would claim that existence of a logarithm and analyticity of g are equivalent to the zero-free and loop conditions without assuming analyticity and domain a priori, which is not the statement).

Step 3: Final check: are the two statements the same?
- No. Key discrepancies:
  - G is not required to be analytic in the code; it must be analytic in the statement.
  - g’s analyticity and Z being a domain are not properly assumed; `Z_is_domain` is unused and `g_is_analytic` is placed on the wrong side of ↔.
  - The loop condition is not formalized and is decoupled from g and Z.
  - The code uses vacuous placeholders instead of Mathlib notions for analyticity, domain, and homotopy.
Given these issues, the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale
- The code employs vacuous placeholder propositions and misplaces core hypotheses. Even if the placeholders were replaced by real Mathlib predicates, the theorem’s logical shape would still be wrong. This fits the rubric’s description for a low score where vacuous definitions are used and the final statement would still not be faithful: grade ≈ 3.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` loads Mathlib, which contains the necessary topology and homotopy theory infrastructure, including `Path`, `FundamentalGroup`, and `MulEquiv`.
- `universe u` sets a universe level for types.
- `theorem fundamental_group_conjugation_isomorphism {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] {x0 x1 : X} (p : Path x0 x1) : MulEquiv (FundamentalGroup X x0) (FundamentalGroup X x1) := by sorry`
  This states: For a topological space `X` and points `x0, x1 : X`, given a path `p` from `x0` to `x1`, there is a group isomorphism (a multiplicative equivalence) between the fundamental group of `X` based at `x0` and the fundamental group of `X` based at `x1`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: Given a specific path `x : [0,1] → X` from `x0` to `x1`, the assignment on loops `[y] ↦ [\bar x * (y * x)]` induces an isomorphism of groups `π1(X, x0) → π1(X, x1)`.
- The Lean statement asserts that, given a path `p : Path x0 x1`, there is an isomorphism `FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* FundamentalGroup X x1`.
- Crucially, the natural statement specifies the explicit map: conjugation by the path `x` (i.e., prepend the inverse path and append the path), and asserts that this particular assignment is a group isomorphism. The Lean code does not specify the map at all; it only asserts the existence (indeed, a particular but unspecified isomorphism, since the theorem returns a concrete `MulEquiv`, but with no characterization tying it to the explicit conjugation map).
- Therefore, the Lean statement is weaker/underspecified compared to the natural language statement: it omits the critical content that the isomorphism is induced by the assignment `[y] ↦ [\bar x*(y*x)]`.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The natural statement asserts that a specific map (conjugation by the path) is an isomorphism.
  - The Lean theorem only states there exists an isomorphism (depending on `p`) between the two fundamental groups, without specifying it is the conjugation map.
- Because the actual mapping is not encoded, the translation is not faithful to the given statement.

Other checks:
- No vacuous definitions are introduced; all objects (`Path`, `FundamentalGroup`, `MulEquiv`) are standard Mathlib notions.
- The presence of `sorry` is about the proof and is allowed per the task; our concern is the statement. The statement itself lacks the required specificity.

Conclusion: Not faithful, because it fails to express that the isomorphism is the conjugation map `[y] ↦ [\bar x*(y*x)]`.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We fix a topological space X.
- The theorem statement `covering_space_of_subgroup (x0 : X) (hpath : PathConnectedSpace X) (hlocal : ∀ x : X, True) (Γ : Subgroup (FundamentalGroup X x0)) : ...` aims to assert existence of a covering corresponding to a subgroup Γ of π₁(X, x0), under the hypotheses that X is path connected (via the typeclass `PathConnectedSpace X`) and locally simply connected. However, the local simple connectivity hypothesis is replaced by the placeholder `(hlocal : ∀ x : X, True)`, which is vacuous and does not encode any topological property. This is a serious red flag: the intended hypothesis is not formalized.
- Conclusion: `∃ (XΓ : Type _) [TopologicalSpace XΓ] (p : XΓ → X) (_ : IsCoveringMap p) (xΓ : XΓ), (IsConnected (univ : Set XΓ)) ∧ (Subgroup.range (FundamentalGroup.map p xΓ x0) = Γ)`
  - This states there exists a type XΓ with a topology, a map p : XΓ → X that is a covering map, a point xΓ in XΓ, such that the whole space XΓ is connected (via `IsConnected univ`) and the subgroup `Subgroup.range (FundamentalGroup.map p xΓ x0)` equals Γ. This last clause is intended to express that the image of π₁(XΓ, xΓ) under p_* is exactly Γ.
  - Missing conditions/details:
    - There is no condition that the basepoint is respected, i.e., no assertion that p xΓ = x0. Depending on the exact signature of `FundamentalGroup.map`, one typically needs a basepoint condition (or a chosen path from p xΓ to x0) to define the induced map. The statement does not include this, so it may be ill-specified mathematically even if Lean has a coercion/path-parameter version. At minimum, the natural-language statement explicitly said “with basepoint xΓ over x0,” i.e., p(xΓ) = x0, which is missing here.
    - The theorem does not state uniqueness up to unique isomorphism of coverings. The natural-language statement requires existence and uniqueness up to unique isomorphism; here only existence is claimed.
    - The local simple connectivity hypothesis is not formalized (replaced by a trivial `True`). Thus, the theorem as stated claims existence under just path-connectedness (since the other hypothesis carries no content), which is stronger than intended and not faithful.
    - No continuity of p is stated explicitly, but `IsCoveringMap p` in Mathlib encapsulates the needed topological structure and continuity, so that part is fine.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For X path connected and locally simply connected, and for Γ ≤ π₁(X, x0), there exists a connected covering space p : X_Γ → X with basepoint xΓ over x0 such that p_* π₁(X_Γ, xΓ) = Γ, and X_Γ is unique up to unique isomorphism of coverings.
- The code’s theorem:
  - Uses a vacuous placeholder for “locally simply connected,” so it does not capture the hypothesis.
  - Omits the required basepoint condition p xΓ = x0.
  - Omits the uniqueness part entirely.
  - The existence part about a connected covering and the equality of the image subgroup is attempted, but due to the missing basepoint condition, even that assertion is not exactly matching the natural-language formulation.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Differences:
  - Hypotheses: “locally simply connected” is not encoded (replaced by `True`).
  - Conclusion: uniqueness up to unique isomorphism is missing.
  - Basepoint alignment: p(xΓ) = x0 is not asserted.
  - Minor formal detail: Using `IsConnected (univ : Set XΓ)` instead of a global connectedness predicate is acceptable but fine.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural-language theorem.

Given these issues (vacuous hypothesis, missing uniqueness, missing basepoint relation), the translation fails per the guidelines.

  Natural language: Let X and Y be topological spaces with basepoints x0 in X and y0 in Y. Let f, g : X → Y be continuous maps which are homotopic (there exists a homotopy h between them). Suppose f(x0) = y0 and g(x0) = y0. Then the induced homomorphisms on the fundamental group, π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, y0), determined by these equalities (i.e., by hf and hg) are equal.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original: “Let f_t : X → Y be a homotopy of continuous maps with f_0(x_0) = f_1(x_0) = y_0. Show that the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups agree: (f_0)_* = (f_1)_* : π_1(X, x_0) → π_1(Y, y_0).”
- Homotopy f g in Lean corresponds to a continuous family between f and g.
- The conditions f(x0) = y0 and g(x0) = y0 match f_0(x_0)=f_1(x_0)=y_0.
- FundamentalGroup.inducedMap hf and FundamentalGroup.inducedMap hg are exactly the induced maps (f_0)_* and (f_1)_* with the specified basepoint identifications.
- Conclusion is equality of these induced maps. This matches the stated conclusion.
No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (Homotopy, FundamentalGroup.inducedMap) are standard Mathlib constructs.

Step 3: Final comparison and potential subtleties.
- The Lean statement matches the natural language statement as written: it assumes a (not necessarily basepoint-preserving) homotopy and endpoint basepoint equalities, and concludes equality of induced maps. While in classical topology one often needs a pointed homotopy to get strict equality (otherwise one gets conjugacy by the track of the basepoint), the provided natural language statement itself claims equality under the given assumptions, and the Lean statement mirrors exactly those assumptions and conclusion. Hence, as a translation, it is faithful.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement with no vacuous placeholders and using standard Mathlib concepts.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- The file sets up topological spaces X and Y.
- structure SerreFibration (f : X → Y) : Prop := (dummy : True). This defines a predicate SerreFibration f that is always true (vacuous placeholder). It does not capture the lifting property that defines a Serre fibration.
- def fiber (f : X → Y) (y0 : Y) : Type u := { x : X // f x = y0 }. This correctly defines the fiber of f over y0 as a subtype.
- def pi (n : ℕ) (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z) : Type u := Z. This defines the homotopy group π_n(Z, z0) as just the underlying type Z, which is a placeholder and not the correct notion of homotopy groups.
- theorem serre_fibration_long_exact_sequence {f : X → Y} (hf : SerreFibration f) (y0 : Y) (x0 : X) : True := by sorry. The main theorem merely asserts True, i.e., a vacuous statement. It does not state any content about a long exact sequence, nor does it even mention the maps between homotopy groups or exactness.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement asserts that for a Serre fibration f: X → Y, the induced maps on homotopy groups fit into a long exact sequence ... → π_n(F, x0) → π_n(X, x0) → π_n(Y, y0) → π_{n-1}(F, x0) → ... . The Lean code does not formalize this at all:
- SerreFibration is a vacuous predicate and does not encode the Serre lifting property.
- The homotopy groups π_n are replaced by a placeholder def pi returning Z, not a group and not π_n.
- The “theorem” asserts True rather than the existence/structure of a long exact sequence. It contains no sequence, no maps, and no exactness property.
Thus the code is not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- The original statement: existence of a long exact sequence of homotopy groups for a Serre fibration, with specific maps and exactness.
- The Lean code: creates placeholders and concludes a trivial True statement, offering no mathematical content related to long exact sequences.
Additionally, the theorem uses “by sorry” and the statement is True; even if placeholders for SerreFibration and pi were replaced by correct definitions, the theorem statement itself would still be vacuous and not the target statement. Therefore it fails the faithfulness test.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definitions (SerreFibration, pi) and the final theorem is just True, so even fixing placeholders would not make the final statement faithful. This matches the rubric for grade 3.

- Lean code: Gives (1) the general correct inclusion with closure(U), and (2) the desired sharper inclusion but under the assumption that U is closed, not open.

Final check — are they the same?
- No. The natural language requires U to be open and concludes closure(A ∩ U) ⊆ closure(A) ∩ U. The Lean code does not provide this; instead it proves the sharper inclusion when U is closed and the general inclusion with closure(U) without assuming openness. The assumption ""U open"" appears nowhere, and the conclusion in the second theorem uses ""U closed"" instead.

  This declares a theorem for two topological spaces X and Y, with subsets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y. It asserts the conjunction of two equalities:

  - `closure (A ×ˢ B) = closure A ×ˢ closure B`, i.e., the closure of the product equals the product of the closures.
  The `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language states: Let X be a topological space. Prove (A × B)^∘ = A^∘ × B^∘ and overline A × overline B = overline (A × B).
- The Lean code formulates this in the standard, slightly more general form with two spaces X and Y, A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y. This is the canonical setting for these product statements and matches the intended meaning. The equalities themselves match exactly (order of equality is immaterial).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variables {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are types with topologies.
- `variable (F : ({t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1} × X) → Y)`: A function F from the subtype [0,1] × X to Y. No continuity is assumed; it's not asserted to be a homotopy in Lean.
- `variable (x0 x1 : X) (x : Path x0 x1)`: Points x0, x1 in X and a path x from x0 to x1.
- `variable (y0 y1 : Y) (y : Path y0 y1)`: Points y0, y1 in Y and a path y from y0 to y1.
- `variable (x_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup X x1)`: An arbitrary function between fundamental groups at x0 and x1 (not specified as the change-of-basepoint isomorphism coming from x).
- `variable (y_star : FundamentalGroup Y y0 → FundamentalGroup Y y1)`: An arbitrary function between fundamental groups at y0 and y1 (not specified as the change-of-basepoint isomorphism coming from y).
- `variable (f0_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup Y y0)`: An arbitrary function between fundamental groups (not specified as the induced map by f0).
- `variable (f1_star : FundamentalGroup X x1 → FundamentalGroup Y y1)`: An arbitrary function between fundamental groups (not specified as the induced map by f1).
- Lemma statement: `(y_star ∘ f0_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup Y y1) = (f1_star ∘ x_star : FundamentalGroup X x0 → FundamentalGroup Y y1)`. This asserts an equality of two compositions of arbitrary functions between fundamental groups, with no hypotheses relating these functions to F, x, y, f0, f1. The proof is `sorry`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement assumes F is a homotopy (continuous), defines f_t = F(t, ·), selects x0, x1 with y0 = f0(x0), y1 = f1(x1), and a path x from x0 to x1. It then defines y(t) = F(t, x(t)), and defines the specific change-of-basepoint isomorphisms x_* and y_* from these paths, and the induced maps (f0)_*, (f1)_* from f0 and f1. The conclusion is the functorial identity y_* ∘ (f0)_* = (f1)_* ∘ x_*.
- The Lean code does not encode that F is continuous or even use F in the lemma. It does not define f0, f1, nor y = F(·, x(·)), nor y0 = f0(x0), y1 = f1(x1). The maps x_star, y_star, f0_star, f1_star are completely arbitrary functions, not the canonical ones induced by the geometry. The lemma claims an equality with no hypotheses tying these maps together.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean lemma is an equality of arbitrary function compositions between fundamental groups, independent of F, x, and y. It omits all the essential structure: continuity of F (homotopy), the definitions of f0, f1, the relationship y(t) = F(t, x(t)), and the specific induced/change-of-basepoint maps. Moreover, the lemma is left with `sorry` and would be false in general for arbitrary functions. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Key discrepancies:
- F is not required to be a homotopy (no continuity assumption) and is unused.
- y is not defined in terms of F and x; y0, y1 are not constrained by f0, f1.
- x_star, y_star, f0_star, f1_star are arbitrary, not the canonical induced maps.
- The lemma asserts an unconditional equality of arbitrary function compositions.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language
- First statement: ""Closed subsets of A in the subspace topology are exactly the sets A ∩ C for C closed in X."" The Lean statement uses the inclusion coe and says s is closed in A iff s = coe⁻¹'(C) for some closed C ⊆ X. This is exactly the same characterization since coe⁻¹'(C) is A ∩ C (interpreted as a subset of the subtype A).
- Second statement: ""The closure of S ⊆ A inside A is A ∩ closure_X(S)."" The Lean statement says closure_A(S) equals coe⁻¹'(closure_X(coe '' S)). This is the same, since coe '' S is S seen in X, and taking coe⁻¹' is intersecting with A.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The formalization uses Subtype A and the inclusion map coe, which is the standard way to represent the subspace topology in Lean. Both equivalences match the intended statements precisely. No vacuous definitions are used; only theorem statements (with omitted proofs) are present. There is no change in generality or meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statements.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language and assess.
- import Mathlib: Uses Mathlib, but no specific concepts (like fundamental groups, amalgamated products) are referenced.
- theorem van_kampen_amalgam {X : Type} [TopologicalSpace X] {ι : Type} (x0 : X) (U : ι → Set X) ... (π : Type) (π_i : ι → Type) (π_ij : ι → ι → Type) : True := by sorry
  Translation: For any topological space X, any index type ι, a basepoint x0 ∈ X, a family of subsets U i of X, such that:
  • h_cover: ⋃ i, U i = univ (the U i cover X),
  • h_open: each U i is open,
  • h_contains: x0 ∈ U i for all i,
  and for arbitrary types π, π_i, π_ij, we conclude True.
  Observations:
  • The conclusion is just True, hence vacuous.
  • There is no use of fundamental group π1, no group structure, no inclusion maps, no mention of path-connectedness, locally simply connected, or path-connected intersections.
  • The symbols π, π_i, π_ij are arbitrary Types, not groups, and not tied to π1 at all.
  • The proof is omitted with by sorry, but since the goal is True, it is trivial/vacuous.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
Original: Van Kampen–type statement: For X path connected and locally simply connected, with a cover by path-connected open sets whose pairwise intersections are path connected and all contain x0, let π = π1(X, x0), π_a = π1(X_a, x0), π_ab = π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0). Then π is the amalgamated free product of the π_a over the π_ab.
Needed formal features: fundamental groups, path-connectedness, local simple connectivity, path-connected intersections, basepoint compatibility, and a conclusion about an amalgamated free product (pushout in Grp) of groups.
Code: Does none of this. It neither defines nor references π1, nor amalgamated free products, nor group structure, nor the required hypotheses (path-connectedness, locally simply connected, intersections path connected). The “conclusion” is simply True and thus conveys no mathematical content of Van Kampen.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
They are different. The Lean theorem is entirely vacuous and does not state the Van Kampen theorem at all. Even if one were to fill in proofs, the statement remains trivial (True). It also weakens or omits all crucial hypotheses, and the introduced π, π_i, π_ij are arbitrary Types, not the fundamental groups; no amalgamation is mentioned or constructed.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable {X Y Z : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z]`: We have topological spaces X, Y, Z.
- `[T2Space X]`: X is Hausdorff.
- `(f : X → Y)`: A map f from X to Y.
- `(IsCoveringMap : (X → Y) → Prop)`: An abstract predicate meant to represent “f is a covering map” (not tied to Mathlib’s actual definition).
- `(hf : IsCoveringMap f)`: Assume f satisfies this covering map predicate.
- Theorem `covering_map_lift_unique` states: Given continuous maps `g1 g2 : Z → X` (hypotheses `hg1 : Continuous g1`, `hg2 : Continuous g2`), with pointwise equality of compositions `(hcomp : ∀ z, f (g1 z) = f (g2 z))`, and a point `z0 : Z` where they agree `heq : g1 z0 = g2 z0`, and assuming `Z` is connected (`hconn : ConnectedSpace Z`), then `g1 = g2`.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: Let f: X → Y be a covering map with X Hausdorff. Suppose g1, g2: Z → X satisfy f(g1 z) = f(g2 z) for all z. If g1(z0) = g2(z0) for some z0, then g1 = g2. No assumptions are stated about continuity of g1, g2, or connectedness of Z.

Lean theorem: Assumes X Hausdorff and f is a “covering map” (but via an abstract predicate), plus additional assumptions that g1 and g2 are continuous and that Z is connected. It concludes g1 = g2.

Step 3: Are the two the same?
- Differences:
  - The Lean statement adds nontrivial hypotheses not present in the natural language statement: continuity of g1 and g2, and connectedness of Z. These are standard in the classical uniqueness-of-lifts theorem but are not included in the given statement, so the Lean code is a stronger hypothesis than the original.
  - The “covering map” property is modeled by an abstract predicate `IsCoveringMap` rather than Mathlib’s actual covering map definition. This is not vacuous (not defined as True), but it does not use Mathlib’s concept and the theorem does not use any properties of covering maps besides having the hypothesis present.
- Matches:
  - X Hausdorff, f: X → Y, g1, g2: Z → X, equality of compositions, agreement at a point, and the desired conclusion g1 = g2 are present.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation because it imposes extra essential hypotheses (continuity and connectedness) not mentioned in the original statement, and it uses an abstract predicate for “covering map” rather than Mathlib’s definition.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- def CoveringAction ... : Prop := True. This is an explicit placeholder: it does not encode the actual notion of a covering action (properly discontinuous, free, with quotient a covering map). This is vacuous.
- def LocallySimplyConnectedSpace ... : Prop := True. Another placeholder, also vacuous.
- Variables: Γ is a group; Y is a topological space with a Γ-action; Y is assumed SimplyConnectedSpace (a real Mathlib class). h_loc is a LocallySimplyConnectedSpace Y (but this is the vacuous predicate above).
- orbit_rel and orbit_setoid: These are legitimate constructions of the orbit equivalence relation from the Γ-action, with a correct Setoid instance.
- def X : Type := Quotient (orbit_setoid : Setoid Y). This defines the quotient type X as the orbit space.
- variable [TopologicalSpace (X)]. They assume a topology on X but do not assert it is the quotient topology; this is left abstract, which is weaker than the intended quotient topology.
- def p : Y → X := Quotient.mk. The canonical quotient map at the level of types (independent of the topology on X).
- Main theorem covering_action_yields_universal_cover: Assumes Group Γ, TopologicalSpace Y, MulAction Γ Y, SimplyConnectedSpace Y, and the two placeholder hypotheses h_loc : LocallySimplyConnectedSpace Y and h_action : CoveringAction Γ Y. Concludes: IsCoveringMap (p : Y → X) ∧ ∃ x0 y0, p y0 = x0 ∧ (FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃ Γ). The proof is omitted with sorry.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: If Γ has a covering action on a simply connected and locally simply connected Hausdorff topological space Y, then p : Y → Γ \ Y = X is a universal covering map, hence π1(X) ≅ Γ.
- Discrepancies:
  1) CoveringAction and LocallySimplyConnectedSpace are placeholders set to True. By the auditing guidelines, vacuous auxiliary definitions invalidate the faithfulness.
  2) Hausdorff assumption is missing in the Lean code. The NL statement explicitly assumes Y is Hausdorff.
  3) The code does not assert that p is a universal covering map; it only asserts IsCoveringMap p. While Y being simply connected plus covering map would typically imply p is universal (under standard local conditions), the theorem statement does not include that conclusion. The docstring mentions “universal,” but the formal statement does not.
  4) The topology on X is left abstract and not specified to be the quotient topology; the NL statement implicitly uses the quotient topology. This is another mismatch.
  5) The conclusion about fundamental group: The Lean theorem asserts the existence of a basepoint x0 and a lift y0 with p y0 = x0 and an isomorphism FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃ Γ. This aligns with the “so there is a group isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ” part, modulo basepoint choice.

Overall judgment:
- Because key hypotheses are encoded as vacuous placeholders (CoveringAction and LocallySimplyConnectedSpace), the translation fails per the guidelines. Additional mismatches include omission of Hausdorff, not asserting the quotient topology on X, and not explicitly stating the universal covering property. Even if the placeholders were replaced by correct definitions, the theorem statement still does not state “universal covering map,” though it includes enough ingredients that one could likely derive it. This makes it close in mathematical spirit but not a faithful formal translation as-is.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous auxiliary definitions are present: fail. If fixed, the result would be closer to the original, though still missing explicit universal-cover assertion and Hausdorff assumption. This merits a mid-level score per the rubric.

- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib, bringing in the standard library of mathematics.
- open Complex: Open the Complex namespace (not essential to the statements).

1) finite_dimensional_field_over_R_is_R_or_C:
- Hypotheses: k is a type with a Field structure; it has an Algebra Real k structure (so k is an R-algebra); it is FiniteDimensional over Real; and the algebraMap Real k is injective (this explicitly encodes that R embeds into k, i.e., “k contains R”).
- Conclusion: Either there exists a Real-algebra isomorphism between k and Real, or there exists a Real-algebra isomorphism between k and Complex.
- Natural language: If k is a field containing R with finite real dimension, then k is R or C up to isomorphism. This matches the first sentence exactly. The explicit injectivity assumption faithfully formalizes “containing R.”

2) finite_algebraic_extension_degree_le_two:
- Hypotheses: K is a field and an R-algebra that is finite-dimensional over R.
- Conclusion: Module.rank Real K ≤ 2 (rank here is the cardinal dimension; in finite-dimensional cases this matches the usual vector space dimension). 
- Natural language: This says any finite (hence algebraic) extension of R has degree ≤ 2. This is a clean general corollary of the first theorem and is stronger than the specific “splitting field” instance, so it covers the stated “In particular, the splitting field … has degree at most 2 over R.”

3) complex_is_alg_closed:
- Statement: IsAlgClosed Complex.
- Natural language: This is exactly “every complex polynomial in one variable splits into a product of linear factors over C.” It captures the other “In particular” statement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The first theorem matches the main statement precisely: finite-dimensional real field extensions are R or C up to (R-algebra) isomorphism.
- The second theorem does not mention splitting fields explicitly, but it is a stronger general corollary: any finite extension over R has degree ≤ 2. This immediately implies the claim about splitting fields of real or complex polynomials (those splitting fields lie in C and are finite over R), so it faithfully captures the intended “In particular” consequence.
- The third theorem states exactly that complex polynomials split over C.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; all statements use standard Mathlib notions. Proofs are omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for this translation audit.

Final check:
- The Lean statements are equivalent to, or slightly stronger than, the natural language statements, without introducing any incorrect or vacuous content.
- Minor technical enhancement: the explicit injectivity assumption matches “k contains R.”
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

It states: (∃! h : Quotient s → Y, Continuous h ∧ f = h ∘ Quotient.mk s) ↔ ∀ x₁ x₂, s.r x₁ x₂ → f x₁ = f x₂.
In words: there exists a unique continuous h factoring f through the quotient if and only if f is constant on equivalence classes.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- First part: ""Any continuous map h : X/~ → Y induces a continuous map h ∘ q : X → Y."" The Lean theorem 1 exactly matches this.
- Second part: The natural language statement says: ""Conversely, a continuous map f : X → Y arises in this way (i.e., f = h ∘ q for a unique continuous h) if and only if f is constant on equivalence classes."" The key point is that f is assumed continuous here. Under the quotient topology, the universal property says: for a function f constant on classes, there is a unique h with f = h ∘ q, and h is continuous if and only if f is continuous.

Step 3: Identify discrepancies.
- In the Lean theorem 2, there is no assumption that f is continuous. It asserts an equivalence:
  (∃! continuous h with f = h ∘ q) ↔ (f is constant on classes).
  This is strictly stronger than the standard universal property and the natural language statement, which requires f to be continuous to ensure h is continuous. In general, constancy on classes alone does not ensure the induced h is continuous; rather, continuity of h is equivalent to continuity of f.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation: it omits the hypothesis ""f is continuous"" in the ⇐ direction. As written, the Lean statement is generally false: a discontinuous f that is constant on classes would imply existence of a continuous h, which would force f to be continuous (since q is continuous and composition of continuous maps is continuous), a contradiction.

Other checks:
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions: none are introduced; only standard mathlib notions are used.
- The first theorem is fine.
- The second theorem would be faithful if its left side either dropped ""Continuous h"" or added the hypothesis ""Continuous f"" (and then one could mention uniqueness and continuity of h). As-is, it misses a crucial assumption.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the missing continuity hypothesis on f in the second theorem.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]` sets up a topological space X.
- `variable {A : Type*} (U : A → Set X) (hcover : ⋃ a, U a = univ)` introduces an index type A, a family of subsets U a of X, and the assumption that these sets cover all of X.
- The theorem `path_subintervals_subset_of_open_cover` takes a function `x : ℝ → X` and assumes `hcont : ContinuousOn x (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)`, i.e., x is continuous on [0,1].
- The conclusion asserts existence of:
  - a natural number n,
  - a sequence of real numbers `ts : Fin (n+1) → ℝ` with `ts 0 = 0` and `ts (Fin.last n) = 1`, and strictly increasing adjacent entries `(∀ i : Fin n, ts (i.castSucc) < ts (i.succ))`,
  - and indices `as : Fin n → A`,
  such that for each i, the image `x([ts_i, ts_{i+1}])` is contained in `U (as i)`, formalized as `Set.image x (Icc (ts (i.castSucc)) (ts (i.succ))) ⊆ U (as i)`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: X is covered by open sets {X_a}, and x : [0,1] → X is a path (i.e., continuous). Then there exist 0 = t0 < t1 < ... < tn = 1 and indices a_i with x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) ⊆ X_{a_i}.
- The Lean statement matches nearly all components:
  - X a topological space, a cover indexed by A with union = univ.
  - x is continuous on [0,1] (encoded as ℝ → X with ContinuousOn on Icc(0,1)).
  - Existence of a finite strictly increasing partition from 0 to 1 and corresponding indices so that each subinterval maps into one member of the cover.
- Representation choices (Fin indices, ContinuousOn on Icc, Set.image) are standard and faithful encodings of the natural language.

Step 3: Differences and issues.
- The crucial missing hypothesis: the sets U a are not assumed to be open in the formal statement. The natural language explicitly says “covered by open sets.” Openness is typically essential for such a subdivision result (it allows using continuity to get neighborhoods mapped inside covering sets via open preimages). The code’s statement is thus a nontrivial generalization: it claims the conclusion for arbitrary covering families, not necessarily open. This is a meaningful mismatch.
- Everything else aligns: covering of X (not just the image), the domain [0,1], strict inequalities, and subset condition are all faithfully represented.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement (with proof omitted), so no red flags of that kind.

Conclusion: The only discrepancy is the omission of the openness assumption for the cover. This is a significant hypothesis difference, so the translation is not fully faithful, though it is very close otherwise.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We fix a type X equipped with a topology.

- `def one_point_open (U : Set (WithTop X)) : Prop := ...`: This defines a predicate on subsets U of `WithTop X` (i.e., X with one extra point `⊤`, playing the role of ∞) specifying when U is declared open for the intended one-point compactification topology. The predicate is a disjunction of two cases:
  • Case 1: `(U ⊆ Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X) ∧ IsOpen (WithTop.some ⁻¹' U))`. Translation: U does not contain ∞ and corresponds, via the embedding `some : X → WithTop X`, to an open subset of X. Concretely, U is contained in the copy of X inside `WithTop X`, and the preimage of U under the inclusion map is open in X. This matches “U is open in X” when viewed as a subset of X.
  • Case 2: `((Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X))ᶜ ⊆ U ∧ ∃ C : Set X, IsCompact C ∧ U = (Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X))ᶜ ∪ (Set.range (WithTop.some : X → WithTop X) \ (WithTop.some '' C)))`. Translation: U contains the extra point ∞ (since the complement of the image of X is exactly {∞}), and there exists a compact subset C ⊆ X such that U equals {∞} ∪ (image of X \ image of C). Since `range(some) \ (some '' C)` equals the image of `X \ C`, this is exactly `U = {∞} ∪ (X \ C)` with C compact.
  This matches the intended description: open sets are either opens from X (not containing ∞) or of the form `{∞} ∪ (X \ C)` with C compact.

- `def one_point_topology : TopologicalSpace (WithTop X) := by sorry`: This purports to define a topology on `WithTop X` determined by `one_point_open`, i.e., to show that the declared collection of open sets forms a topology. However, it uses `by sorry`, meaning the construction is omitted and the definition is a placeholder.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language sets up the one-point compactification by declaring opens as either (i) opens in X, or (ii) `{∞} ∪ (X \ C)` for some compact C. The Lean predicate `one_point_open` faithfully encodes exactly these two kinds of sets using the canonical embedding of X into `WithTop X` and the singleton complement for ∞.
- The statement then asks to prove that this declares a topology on `\overline{X}`. In Lean, this corresponds to actually constructing a `TopologicalSpace (WithTop X)` for which the opens are exactly those satisfying `one_point_open`, and verifying the topology axioms. The code introduces `one_point_topology` but leaves its definition as `sorry`, i.e., the actual proof/construction is missing.

3) Are the two problems the same?
- The set-theoretic description of the open sets matches precisely.
- However, the key part “Prove that this defines a topology” is not carried out in the Lean code; the final topology is declared with a placeholder proof. Per the auditing guidelines, a definition or theorem filled with `sorry` is a vacuous placeholder, so the translation fails to deliver the main result.
- Minor note: The code uses `WithTop X` as the carrier for `\overline{X}`. This is acceptable as a representation of X plus one distinguished point, and the set-theoretic encoding via `range(some)` and its complement is accurate.

Conclusion: While the predicate for open sets is faithful, the core objective (defining/proving a topology) is left as a `sorry`. Therefore, the translation is not faithful overall.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code fixes a general real normed vector space E (not specifically R^n), with its usual NormedAddCommGroup and NormedSpace structure.
- The theorem benmckay_top_continuity_543 asserts the existence of a function f from the closed unit ball in E, modeled as the subtype {x : E // ‖x‖ ≤ 1}, into ℝ × E, such that:
  - Injectivity on the interior: For any x, y in the closed unit ball with ‖x‖ < 1 and ‖y‖ < 1, if f x = f y then (x : E) = (y : E). This encodes injectivity on the open unit ball (the interior of the closed ball).
  - Boundary collapse: For any x in the closed unit ball with ‖x‖ = 1, f x = (-1, 0) in ℝ × E.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), but the statement itself is an existence claim: there exists some f with these properties. The docstring explicitly says the explicit construction is omitted and that the theorem only translates the informal statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement specifies a very particular function f: X → Y (with X the closed unit ball in R^n, A its boundary sphere, and Y the unit sphere in R^{n+1}), given by the explicit formula f(x) = (cos(π‖x‖), sin(π‖x‖) x/‖x‖) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = (1,0). The requested proof is that this specific f is injective on the interior X \ A and maps every point of A to (-1,0) ∈ Y.
- The Lean code does not define or refer to this explicit f at all. Instead, it asserts the existence of some function f with the two properties (injectivity on the interior and collapsing the boundary to (-1,0)).
- The codomain in the Lean code is ℝ × E, not the unit sphere Y ⊂ ℝ^{n+1}. There is no assertion that the image lies on the unit sphere, nor that f(0) = (1,0), nor that f agrees with the given formula away from 0.
- The domain is generalized from R^n to an arbitrary normed vector space E. This generalization would be acceptable if the rest matched, but here the mismatch is more substantial: existential vs the specific explicitly-defined map, and omission of the sphere codomain constraint.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The original problem is about a specific, explicitly defined map into the unit sphere, and proving two properties of that map. The Lean theorem only states the existence of some map from the closed unit ball to ℝ × E with those two properties, without tying it to the explicit formula or the sphere codomain. Thus, it is not a faithful translation.

Additional notes:
- Although the two properties (injective on interior and mapping boundary to (-1,0)) are stated correctly, the change from a specific map to an existential statement, and the change of codomain from the sphere to ℝ × E, are significant departures.
- There are no vacuous definitions here, but the mismatch in logical form (existence vs properties of a given explicit function) is substantial.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's mathematical library.
- Comment: States the intended theorem: a continuous function invariant under left multiplication by orthogonal matrices factors through the Gram map V ↦ Vᵀ V.
- `theorem factor_through_gram (n : Nat) (f : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f)`: Fix a natural number n and a continuous function f from the space of n×n real matrices to ℝ. Interpreting an n×n matrix V as the n-tuple of its column vectors v₁,…,vₙ ∈ ℝⁿ, this matches a continuous function of n vectors in ℝⁿ.
- `(hU : ∀ (U : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ), (Matrix.transpose U) * U = 1 → ∀ V, f (U * V) = f V)`: f is invariant under left multiplication by any matrix U with Uᵀ U = I, i.e., any orthogonal matrix. This is exactly the invariance f(U v₁,…,U vₙ) = f(v₁,…,vₙ).
- Conclusion: `∃ g : ({A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // ∃ V : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ, A = Matrix.transpose V * V} → ℝ), Continuous g ∧ ∀ V, f V = g ⟨Matrix.transpose V * V, ⟨V, rfl⟩⟩`.
  This asserts existence of a function g defined on the subtype of n×n real matrices A that can be written as A = Vᵀ V for some V, with g continuous, and such that for all V, f(V) = g(Vᵀ V). The set {A | ∃ V, A = Vᵀ V} is precisely the set of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices (the Gram matrices). Thus g is defined on Y and f factors through the Gram map.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Domain: The natural language has f taking n vectors in ℝⁿ; the code represents this as an n×n matrix V whose columns are those vectors. This is a standard identification; topologies match (product equals matrix topology), so continuity matches.
- Invariance: The code encodes invariance under all orthogonal U via Uᵀ U = I and left multiplication V ↦ U V, which corresponds to applying U simultaneously to all vectors. This matches O(n)-invariance.
- Target Y: The code's domain for g is the subtype {A | A = Vᵀ V for some V}, which exactly equals the set of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. So Y is correctly represented.
- Conclusion: The existence of continuous g with f(V) = g(Vᵀ V) for all V is exactly the desired factorization through the Gram matrix A with entries ⟨vᵢ, vⱼ⟩.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses the matrix viewpoint rather than explicit tuples of vectors; this is equivalent.
- Orthogonality is expressed as Uᵀ U = I rather than U ∈ O(n); these are equivalent in ℝ.
- Y is expressed via existence A = Vᵀ V rather than directly as ""positive semidefinite symmetric""; these characterizations coincide.
- Continuity of g is included, as required.
No substantive differences remain. The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: X is a type with a topology; s is a Setoid on X (an equivalence relation); Quotient s is given a (possibly unspecified) topology instance. Y is another topological space.
- def q : X → Quotient s := Quotient.mk s: This is the canonical quotient map sending x to its equivalence class in X/~.
- Theorem continuous_iff_comp_quotient: With the hypothesis ht asserting that the topology on Quotient s equals the coinduced topology via q (i.e., the quotient topology), for any h : Quotient s → Y, we have Continuous h ↔ Continuous (h ∘ q s). This is the universal property of the quotient/coinduced topology.
- Theorem continuous_descend_iff: Under the same hypothesis ht and assuming F : X → Y is continuous, we have an equivalence: there exists G : Quotient s → Y with Continuous G and G ∘ q s = F if and only if F is constant on equivalence classes, i.e., ∀ x1 x2, Setoid.r s x1 x2 → F x1 = F x2. This captures precisely the descent condition for continuous maps along the quotient.
Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: for the quotient map q: X → X/~, a map h: X/~ → Y is continuous iff h ∘ q is continuous. This matches the first theorem exactly, with the technical Lean hypothesis ht ensuring we are using the quotient topology on X/~ (which is implicit in the natural language).
- The converse part states: a continuous F: X → Y descends to a continuous map X/~ → Y iff F(x1) = F(x2) whenever x1 ~ x2. The second theorem matches this precisely: it assumes F is continuous, and states equivalence between existence of a continuous G factoring F through q and F being constant on equivalence classes. The composition equality G ∘ q = F is the precise formalization of “descends.”
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; q is the real quotient map, and coinduced is the standard Mathlib construction for quotient topology. The extra hypothesis ht is a legitimate and faithful formalization of “X/~ has the quotient topology.”
Final check:
- The Lean statements are the same mathematical content as the natural language statement, with only standard technicalities (explicit hypothesis ht) that align with the intended meaning. No discrepancies found.

- Compatibility on overlaps: for all a b, φ_a a ∘ incl_ab_a a b = φ_a b ∘ incl_ab_b a b.
- Theorem statement: there exists a unique group homomorphism φ : π →* Γ such that for all a, φ ∘ incl_a a = φ_a a.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: X is path connected and locally simply connected, covered by path connected open sets {X_a}, with each finite intersection X_ab := X_a ∩ X_b path connected. Given homomorphisms π_a → Γ that agree on overlaps π_ab, there is a unique group morphism π → Γ extending the φ_a.
- Matches:
  - X is path connected (h_path) and locally simply connected (h_loc_simply, albeit in a possibly stronger form).
  - Each X_a is open and path connected; each pairwise intersection X_a ∩ X_b is path connected.
  - Basepoint x0 is used to define all fundamental groups π, π_a, and π_ab (by assuming x0 ∈ each X_a), consistent with the informal setup.
  - Compatibility of the φ_a on overlaps via the maps from π_ab to π_a and π_b is included (hcompat).
  - The conclusion is uniqueness and existence of φ : π →* Γ that extends each φ_a via inclusion maps.
- Mismatches / issues:
  1) Missing cover condition: The code does not assume that the family {X_a} covers X (i.e., ⋃_a X_a = X or ∀ x, ∃ a, x ∈ X_a a). This is explicitly stated in the natural language and is crucial for the van Kampen-style extension.
  2) Inclusion-induced maps are not defined, only assumed: The code introduces incl_a, incl_ab_a, incl_ab_b as arbitrary homomorphisms, with a comment that they are treated as given inclusion-induced maps. However, there is no constraint tying them to the actual inclusion-induced maps from topological inclusions. This makes the theorem strictly different/stronger than the intended one.
  3) Local simply connectedness formulation: The code requires existence of an open U containing each point that is itself simply connected (SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U)). This is stronger than the standard definition of locally simply connected (which is about loops in smaller neighborhoods contracting in larger ones). This is a permissible strengthening but not an exact match.
  4) ""Finite intersections"" vs pairwise: The text mentions ""every finite intersection X_ab"", but clearly uses X_ab to denote pairwise intersections; the code assumes pairwise path-connectedness. This is likely acceptable given the notation in the statement.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- They are not the same. The missing cover property and the failure to tie incl_* maps to inclusion-induced maps are substantive differences. The stronger local simply connectedness hypothesis is a mild specialization which would be acceptable, but the two main issues alter the meaning materially.

Conclusion: The code is close in spirit but not a faithful translation of the natural language statement due to missing cover assumption and not encoding that the maps are the inclusion-induced ones.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem states there is a homeomorphism between AddCircle (1 : ℝ) and the subtype { y : ℝ × ℝ // y ∈ Set.range (fun t : ℝ => (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi * t), Real.sin (2 * Real.pi * t))) }.
- Interpreted: The additive circle of circumference 1 (i.e., ℝ modulo integer translations by 1) is homeomorphic to the unit circle in ℝ², expressed as the image of the map t ↦ (cos(2πt), sin(2πt)) from ℝ to ℝ². The right-hand side is the unit circle as a subspace. No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Start with X = [0,1] ⊂ ℝ, Y = {(cos(2πt), sin(2πt)) : t ∈ [0,1]} ⊂ ℝ². Show the quotient space X/{0∼1} (identify 0 and 1) is homeomorphic to Y (the unit circle with the subspace topology).
- Code’s right-hand side matches Y as a set/topological subspace: using range over ℝ instead of [0,1] yields the same unit circle subset.
- Code’s left-hand side is AddCircle(1), i.e., ℝ/ℤ (period 1). This is a standard model of the circle, but it is not literally the quotient [0,1]/(0∼1). While [0,1] with endpoints identified is homeomorphic to AddCircle(1), that identification is not stated here. So the theorem formalizes a related but different source space: it proves AddCircle(1) ≅ unit circle, not [0,1]/(0∼1) ≅ unit circle.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different. The code proves a homeomorphism from ℝ/ℤ to the unit circle, whereas the statement asks for the quotient of the closed interval with endpoints identified to be homeomorphic to the unit circle. These two spaces are indeed homeomorphic, but the code does not mention or prove the equivalence between [0,1]/(0∼1) and AddCircle(1). Thus the translation is not literally faithful to the stated domain. The right-hand side set (unit circle) matches; the left-hand side does not.

No vacuous definitions or placeholders beyond an omitted proof; the issue is a mismatch of the domain model. This is very close, standard, and mathematically equivalent up to a known homeomorphism, but not a faithful translation of the exact statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Filter Topology` just prepare the environment and open useful namespaces; no mathematical content change.
- The docstring restates the natural language claim: for a map f between topological spaces, f is continuous iff for every subset A of Y, the closure of the preimage equals the preimage of the closure.
- `theorem continuous_iff_closure_preimage_eq_preimage_closure {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] {f : X → Y} : Continuous f ↔ ∀ (A : Set Y), closure (f ⁻¹' A) = f ⁻¹' (closure A) := by sorry`
  This declares X and Y as types with topologies, f : X → Y, and asserts the equivalence: f is continuous if and only if, for all A ⊆ Y, one has closure(f⁻¹(A)) = f⁻¹(closure(A)). The `by sorry` means the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for auditing translation faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The Lean theorem states exactly the same bidirectional equivalence and quantification over all subsets A of Y, using standard Mathlib notions (Continuous, closure, preimage). There are no auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions.
- The closure operators are applied in the correct spaces (closure of f⁻¹(A) in X, and closure(A) in Y), matching the intended meaning.

3) Final check — same or different?:
- The natural language statement and the Lean theorem are the same mathematically: both assert the iff with equality of closure of preimage and preimage of closure for all A ⊆ Y.
- No discrepancies or changes in generality/scope. No extra assumptions or restrictions. Thus the translation is faithful.

Note: While the mathematical claim is stronger than the standard continuity characterization (which usually gives only inclusion), the task here is to check faithfulness of translation, and the Lean statement mirrors the natural language exactly.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: X is a topological space.
- The theorem `homotopic_of_reparam` takes:
  - `x y : ℝ → X` with `hx : ContinuousOn x (Icc 0 1)` and `hy : ContinuousOn y (Icc 0 1)`: x and y are continuous on the closed unit interval [0,1] (i.e., they are paths when restricted to [0,1]).
  - `τ : ℝ → ℝ` with `hτ_cont : ContinuousOn τ (Icc 0 1)`: τ is continuous on [0,1].
  - `hτ_strict : StrictMonoOn τ (Icc 0 1)`: τ is strictly increasing on [0,1].
  - `hτ0 : τ 0 = 0` and `hτ1 : τ 1 = 1`: τ fixes the endpoints.
  - `hreparam : ∀ s ∈ Icc 0 1, y (τ s) = x s`: y ∘ τ = x on [0,1].
- Conclusion: There exists `H : ℝ × ℝ → X` such that
  - `ContinuousOn H (Icc 0 1 ×ˢ Icc 0 1)`: H is continuous on the square [0,1] × [0,1].
  - `∀ s ∈ Icc 0 1, H (s, 0) = x s`: at time t=0, H equals x.
  - `∀ s ∈ Icc 0 1, H (s, 1) = y s`: at time t=1, H equals y.
  - `∀ t ∈ Icc 0 1, H (0, t) = x 0` and `∀ t ∈ Icc 0 1, H (1, t) = x 1`: the endpoints s=0 and s=1 are fixed throughout the homotopy (relative to {0,1}). Since y ∘ τ = x and τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1, we also have y 0 = x 0 and y 1 = x 1, so this indeed encodes homotopy relative to {0,1}.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The hypotheses match: x and y are continuous on [0,1]; τ is continuous and strictly increasing on [0,1] with τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1; and y ∘ τ = x on [0,1]. While τ is typed as ℝ → ℝ (not explicitly [0,1] → [0,1]), the conditions `StrictMonoOn` on [0,1] together with endpoint equalities imply τ([0,1]) ⊆ [0,1], so this matches the intended setting.
- The conclusion matches “x is homotopic to y relative to {0,1}”: existence of H continuous on the square, with H(·,0)=x, H(·,1)=y, and H fixes the boundary {0,1} in the first coordinate.

Possible minor formalization differences and their assessment:
- Using functions ℝ → X and ℝ → ℝ with `ContinuousOn` over Icc [0,1] instead of functions defined on the subtype [0,1] is standard and equivalent in this context.
- Not explicitly stating τ maps into [0,1] is harmless because it is implied by strict monotonicity and endpoint conditions; moreover y is defined on all ℝ anyway.
- The statement encodes homotopy relative to {0,1} exactly via the boundary conditions.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given (with `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Final check:
- The Lean theorem precisely formalizes the natural language claim: If y is a strictly increasing reparametrization of x (with τ continuous, increasing, fixing endpoints), then x and y are homotopic relative to {0,1}. No substantive discrepancies.
