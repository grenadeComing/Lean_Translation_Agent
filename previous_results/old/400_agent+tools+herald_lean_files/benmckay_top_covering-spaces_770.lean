/-- Abstract placeholder for the fundamental group of a space X. -/
constant FundamentalGroup : Type u → Type u

/-- Statement (no proof): Let X be a Hausdorff, path connected and locally simply connected
    topological space. Then the deck transformation group of the universal covering of X
    is (canonically) isomorphic to the fundamental group π₁(X), with the group operation
    induced by concatenation of loops (written [x][y] = [x * y]). -/
