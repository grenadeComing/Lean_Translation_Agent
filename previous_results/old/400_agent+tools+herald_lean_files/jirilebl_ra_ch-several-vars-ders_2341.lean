/-- The sum of two bounded linear maps is bounded; the operator norm satisfies the triangle inequality. -/
theorem opNorm_add_le (A B : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖A + B‖ ≤ ‖A‖ + ‖B‖ := by sorry

/-- Scalar multiples of bounded linear maps are bounded; the operator norm scales by the absolute value. -/
theorem opNorm_smul (c : ℝ) (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖c • A‖ = |c| * ‖A‖ := by sorry

/-- Nonnegativity of the operator norm. -/
theorem opNorm_nonneg (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : 0 ≤ ‖A‖ := by sorry

/-- Definiteness: the operator norm is zero iff the operator is the zero map. -/
theorem opNorm_eq_zero_iff (A : X →L[ℝ] Y) : ‖A‖ = 0 ↔ A = 0 := by sorry

/-- The operator norm on L(X, Y) satisfies the norm axioms. -/
