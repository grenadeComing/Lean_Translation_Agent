For any positive integer n, if A is an n×n matrix and B is the matrix obtained from A by performing
a single elementary row operation, then B = U * A, where U is the corresponding elementary
n×n elementary matrix of the same type.

We formalize this statement by introducing two abstract predicates:
- `obtained_by_single_row_op A B` meaning B is obtained from A by a single elementary row op,
- `elementary_matrix U` meaning U is an elementary matrix.

The theorem then asserts existence of such a U with B = U ⬝ A. The proof is omitted (:= by sorry).
