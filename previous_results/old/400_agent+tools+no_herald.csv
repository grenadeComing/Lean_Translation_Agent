1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `theorem neg_one_mul_eq_neg {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a : R) : (-1 : R) * a = -a := by sorry` translates to: For any type R with a ring structure and any element a : R, we have (-1) * a = -a. Here `(-1 : R)` is the multiplicative unit -1 in R, `*` is multiplication, and `-a` is the additive inverse of a.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Let R be a ring and a ∈ R. Show that (-1)a = -a. The Lean statement is exactly that: in a ring R, for any a, (-1 : R) * a = -a.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The formulation matches precisely (no unwanted extra hypotheses or generalization).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]`: Let R be a ring (a type equipped with a ring structure).
- `theorem mul_sub_left (a b c : R) : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry`: For all elements a, b, c in R, we have a(b − c) = ab − ac.

2) Fidelity assessment:
This is exactly the distributivity of multiplication over subtraction on the left in a ring. The natural language statement asks to show that for a ring R and a, b, c ∈ R, a(b − c) = ab − ac. The Lean statement matches this precisely. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; it uses the standard Mathlib `Ring` typeclass. While the proof is omitted (`sorry`), our task is only to check the translation of the statement.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. The Lean version possibly assumes a slightly stronger algebraic structure than strictly necessary (a ring rather than, say, a semiring), but the natural language explicitly says ""ring,"" so it matches exactly. No discrepancies.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: For a ring R and a ∈ R, show a·0 = 0 = 0·a. This consists of two equalities: a·0 = 0 and 0·a = 0. The Lean code provides exactly these as two theorems, under the assumption `[Ring R]`, matching “R is a ring.” The use of two separate theorems is an equivalent formalization of the single chain equality.

3) Final check for differences:
- Scope: Both assume R is a ring; the Lean code uses `[Ring R]`, matching the statement. (It could also hold for semirings, but restricting to rings is fine.)
- Content: The two equalities match precisely. Presenting them as two theorems instead of a chained equality is standard and faithful.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; `sorry` placeholders are in proofs only, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib library.
- `theorem neg_mul_neg_example {R : Type _} [Ring R] (a b : R) : (-a) * (-b) = a * b := by sorry`
  This states: For any type R with a ring structure, and any elements a, b in R, we have (-a) * (-b) = a * b. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let R be a ring and a, b ∈ R. Show that (-a)(-b) = ab.
- Lean: Exactly the same content: assumes R is a ring, a and b are elements of R, and claims (-a) * (-b) = a * b.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only potential nuance is that Mathlib's `Ring` usually includes a multiplicative identity (ring with 1), whereas some texts allow rings without 1. This is a mild specialization and fully acceptable per the guidelines; it does not change the statement being proven.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement directly matches the natural language claim.

- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_507 (R : Type _) [Ring R] (a b : R) : a * -b = -(a * b) ∧ -(a * b) = (-a) * b := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type R with a ring structure, and any elements a, b in R, we have the two equalities: a multiplied by the additive inverse of b equals the additive inverse of a*b, and the additive inverse of a*b equals the product of the additive inverse of a with b. The use of ∧ means both equalities hold simultaneously. No commutativity is assumed (just Ring R), which matches the general statement.

2) Whole translation vs original:
Original statement: “Let R be a ring and let a,b∈R. Show that a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b.” This is precisely the pair of equalities a * -b = -(a*b) and -(a*b) = (-a)*b. The Lean statement asserts exactly these two equalities for arbitrary R, a, b, bundled as a conjunction. This matches the chain equality in the natural language.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean code uses [Ring R], matching “R is a ring.”
- No extra hypotheses or restrictions; noncommutative allowed, which is fine.
- The chain equality is expressed as two equalities joined by ∧, which is logically equivalent to the chain.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The theorem body is `sorry`, but per the instructions we only assess the statement; it compiles and faithfully states the claim.
Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]` sets R as a ring. `variable (a b c : R)` introduces arbitrary elements a, b, c in R. This matches the natural language setup.
- `theorem mul_zero : a * 0 = 0` states a * 0 = 0.
- `theorem zero_mul : 0 * a = 0` states 0 * a = 0.
- `theorem mul_neg : a * (-b) = -(a * b)` states a(-b) = −(ab).
- `theorem neg_mul : (-a) * b = -(a * b)` states (−a)b = −(ab).
- `theorem neg_mul_neg : (-a) * (-b) = a * b` states (−a)(−b) = ab.
- `theorem distrib_sub : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c` states a(b − c) = ab − ac.
- `theorem neg_one_mul : (-1 : R) * a = -a` states (−1)a = −a.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original asks to prove: a·0 = 0 = 0·a; a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b; (−a)(−b) = ab; a(b − c) = ab − ac; and (−1)a = −a.
- The Lean code provides separate theorems for each equality, covering both sides of the chained equalities: it proves a*0=0 and 0*a=0; a*(−b)=−(a*b) and (−a)*b=−(a*b). This is equivalent to the chain equalities in the statement. The remaining equalities match exactly.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced. The use of `[Ring R]` matches the ring context of the original problem.

Final check: The mathematical content of the Lean statements matches the natural language claims precisely. Splitting chained equalities into separate theorems is a faithful formalization.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: States the problem informally (here saying n is an integer, not necessarily positive).
- Theorem `srdoty_alg_Z_n_671 (n a b c d : Int) (h1 : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) (h2 : c ≡ d [ZMOD n]) : a + c ≡ b + d [ZMOD n]`: For integers n, a, b, c, d, assuming the congruences a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), conclude a + c ≡ b + d (mod n). The `[ZMOD n]` notation is the standard Mathlib congruence modulo the integer n.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c, d ∈ ℤ. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod n).
- Lean theorem: Same statement but with n an arbitrary integer (not assumed positive). The conclusion is exactly the same congruence.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness
- The only difference is that the Lean version allows any integer n (including 0 or negative). This is a harmless generalization; the property remains true for all n, and the natural statement is a special case (n positive). No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly matches the intended mathematical content.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization (indeed, a slight generalization) of the given statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def approx (a b : Real) : Prop := ∃ k : Int, a - b = k`
  This defines a binary relation `approx` on the real numbers: for real numbers `a` and `b`, `approx a b` holds if and only if there exists an integer `k` such that `a - b = k`. In Lean, `k` is implicitly coerced to a real on the right-hand side, so this matches the idea that `a - b` is an integer.
- `theorem approx_equivalence : Equivalence (approx : Real → Real → Prop) := by sorry`
  This states that `approx` is an equivalence relation on `ℝ` (i.e., it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is exactly asserting equivalence.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language defines a relation on `ℝ` by `a ≈ b` iff `a - b ∈ ℤ`, and asks to prove it is an equivalence relation. The Lean code defines `approx a b` exactly as “there exists `k : ℤ` with `a - b = k`”, which is equivalent to “`a - b` is an integer,” and then states that this relation is an equivalence relation. Thus the translation is faithful.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The use of `∃ k : Int, a - b = k` faithfully represents `a - b ∈ ℤ` in Lean via coercion of `Int` to `Real`.
- The theorem asserts exactly that the relation is an equivalence relation on `ℝ`.
- Notationally, `approx` stands in for `≈`, which is acceptable.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  This states: For any integer n and integers a, b, c, if a is congruent to b modulo n and b is congruent to c modulo n, then a is congruent to c modulo n. The notation `[ZMOD n]` is Mathlib’s standard notation for congruence modulo the integer n in ℤ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let n be a fixed positive integer and a, b, c ∈ ℤ. If a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n).
- The Lean theorem captures the same transitivity property of congruence modulo n over ℤ. It quantifies over n, a, b, c and asserts the same implication of congruences.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: The Lean code allows any integer n (possibly 0 or negative), whereas the natural language specifies n is a positive integer. This is a slight generalization; the transitivity statement remains true for all integers n (including 0 and negative n), so the formal statement is stronger but still faithful to the intended result.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct and uses standard Mathlib notation.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful (indeed a slight generalization) and matches the mathematical meaning of the original statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: Let G be a finite group.
- The theorem `card_pow_prime_of_all_elements_have_p_power_order` takes:
  - `p : ℕ` with `hp : p.Prime`: a fixed prime p.
  - `h_orders : ∀ g : G, ∃ k : ℕ, orderOf g = p ^ k`: for every element g in G, there exists a natural number k such that the order of g is exactly p^k.
  - `h_card_gt_one : (Fintype.card G) > 1`: the cardinality of G is greater than 1 (i.e., G is nontrivial).
  Conclusion: There exists `r : ℕ` such that `1 ≤ r` and `Fintype.card G = p ^ r`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: If G is a finite group in which every element has order a power of a fixed prime p, then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.
- Finite group: captured by `[Fintype G]`.
- Every element has order a p-power: captured exactly by `orderOf g = p ^ k` for some `k : ℕ` for each g.
- Fixed prime p: encoded by `hp : p.Prime`.
- Conclusion: |G| is exactly `p ^ r` with `r ≥ 1`: encoded by `∃ r : ℕ, 1 ≤ r ∧ Fintype.card G = p ^ r`.
- The Lean code adds `h_card_gt_one` (|G| > 1), which ensures nontriviality so that the `r ≥ 1` conclusion is consistent. The natural language conclusion already states `r ≥ 1`, which implicitly excludes the trivial group; thus adding nontriviality as a hypothesis is a natural and faithful refinement.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only difference is the explicit hypothesis `Fintype.card G > 1`. The original statement requires `r ≥ 1`, which would be false for the trivial group; so the Lean code's hypothesis matches the intended nontrivial case. There are no vacuous definitions or placeholders; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The scope (finite group, all elements with order exactly p^k, fixed prime p) matches perfectly, and the conclusion matches as stated.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: Let n > 0 be an integer, a, b ∈ ℤ. Prove a ≡ b (mod n) iff a and b have the same remainder upon division by n.
- Lean formalization: Uses integers throughout (n : Int, a b : Int), includes the positivity assumption (hn : 0 < n), uses Int.ModEq for congruence modulo n, and uses the integer remainder operator `%` to represent the remainder upon division by n. This matches the intended meaning (for positive n, the remainder is the standard nonnegative remainder less than n in Lean's convention). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement directly encodes the equivalence.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_1021 {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 < n) {a b : ZMod n} (ha : IsUnit a) : ∃ x : ZMod n, a * x = b` says: Let n be a natural number with 1 < n. Let a and b be elements of ZMod n (the ring of integers modulo n). If a is a unit in ZMod n, then there exists x in ZMod n such that a * x = b. This equation in ZMod n is exactly the statement that ax ≡ b (mod n). There are no auxiliary definitions, and `sorry` is only the (omitted) proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- Natural statement: For integer n > 1, the linear congruence a x ≡ b (mod n) has a solution in Z_n whenever the class [a] ∈ Z_n is a unit.
- Lean statement: For n > 1, for any a, b in ZMod n, if a is a unit, there exists x in ZMod n with a * x = b.
- Equality in ZMod n corresponds to congruence modulo n; `a : ZMod n` directly represents the class [a]; `IsUnit a` matches “the class [a] is a unit”. The conclusion gives existence of a solution x in Z_n for the congruence. The hypothesis `1 < n` matches “n > 1”. Thus the formalization is a faithful translation.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The natural statement speaks of integers modulo n and their classes; the Lean code works directly in ZMod n. These are equivalent viewpoints.
- Quantification over b: The Lean theorem is stated for arbitrary b ∈ ZMod n, which aligns with the natural-language claim for a given b and implies the general case. No mismatch here.
- The presence of `hn : 1 < n` matches the natural assumption n > 1; it is not essential for the algebraic truth but aligns with the stated condition.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The use of `sorry` only omits the proof, which is allowed per the auditing instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: bring in standard math library and set notation.
- The theorem declaration: For a type `R` with a `CommRing` structure, `IsField R ↔ (Set.range (fun u : Units R => (u : R))) = {x : R | x ≠ 0}`. In words: R is a field if and only if the image in R of the coercion from the group of units `Units R` equals the set of all nonzero elements of R.

2) Assessment of the whole translation:
- `IsField R` is the standard Mathlib predicate that R is a field (for a commutative ring). 
- `Set.range (fun u : Units R => (u : R))` is exactly the set of elements of R that are units (i.e., the underlying elements of units). 
- `{x : R | x ≠ 0}` is the set of nonzero elements of R. 
- Hence the statement is precisely: a commutative ring R is a field iff the set of units equals the set of nonzero elements.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language uses the notation R^× = R \ {0}; the Lean states equality between the image of `Units R` in `R` and the set of nonzero elements in `R`. This is exactly the same content, accounting for formal type/subset distinctions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem uses standard Mathlib notions (`IsField`, `Units`, `Set.range`).
- No substantive differences or hidden assumptions beyond those implicit in the standard statement.

  This declares (constructively) an additive group isomorphism between ZMod m × ZMod n and ZMod (m*n), assuming m,n are natural numbers at least 1 and coprime (Nat.Coprime m n means gcd(m,n)=1). The `≃+` denotes an additive group equivalence. The proof/body is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing as we only care about the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For integers m,n ≥ 1 with gcd(m,n)=1, Z_m × Z_n ≅ Z_{mn}.
- The Lean statement: For natural numbers m,n ≥ 1 and coprime, there is an additive group isomorphism (ZMod m × ZMod n) ≃+ ZMod (m*n).
- Using ℕ rather than ℤ is a standard formalization for positive integers. The condition `1 ≤ m, 1 ≤ n` matches “≥ 1”. `Nat.Coprime m n` matches gcd=1. ZMod m is the standard notation for ℤ/mℤ. The result type `≃+` is precisely an isomorphism of additive groups, which is the intended meaning of “≅” in this context. Thus the formal statement is a faithful translation.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain and codomain: exactly Z_m × Z_n and Z_{mn} as additive groups.
- Hypotheses: m,n ≥ 1 and coprime: matches.
- Structure of isomorphism: additive group isomorphism; the natural statement likely means group isomorphism; this is appropriate. The code gives a specific equivalence rather than mere existence, which is a harmless strengthening and standard in Lean. No auxiliary, vacuous, or misleading definitions are present.

Conclusion: The code faithfully states the Chinese remainder isomorphism for additive groups in the required form.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The first theorem exactly captures the statement ""[a] is a unit iff gcd(a,n)=1"" for n > 0, with the minor technical choice of taking a ∈ ℕ and interpreting [a] as `(a : ZMod n)`. This is standard and faithful since each class has a natural representative and gcd(a, n) = 1 is invariant under changing representatives mod n.
- The second theorem expresses the set of units as a subset of ZMod n: `{x | IsUnit x}` equals the subset `{x | ∃ a, x = (a : ZMod n) ∧ gcd(a, n) = 1}`, which matches the natural-language set `{[a] ∈ Z_n : gcd(a,n)=1}`. Using ℕ representatives is harmless and faithful.
- The assumption `0 < n` matches ""Let n be a positive integer."" This avoids the n = 0 edge case where the statement would differ.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced, and there is no vacuous or placeholder content beyond omitted proofs (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the task instructions. The Mathlib concepts used are standard and appropriate.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem center_symm_trivial {n : Nat} (hn : 3 ≤ n) :` 
  This states: For a natural number n with hypothesis hn: 3 ≤ n, we have the following equality of sets.
- `{σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) | ∀ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), σ.trans τ = τ.trans σ} = {Equiv.refl (Fin n)} := by
  sorry`
  The left-hand side is the set of permutations σ of Fin n (i.e., elements of Sym_n) such that for every permutation τ of Fin n, the composition σ.trans τ equals τ.trans σ. Since `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is the symmetric group on n letters, and `trans` is composition of permutations (up to conventional order), this is exactly the set of elements that commute with all elements of the group—the center. The right-hand side `{Equiv.refl (Fin n)}` is the singleton set containing the identity permutation. So the statement asserts that under the assumption 3 ≤ n, the center of the symmetric group on n letters is the trivial set containing only the identity.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: For n ≥ 3, the center Z(Sym_n) is trivial. The Lean statement says: For n ≥ 3, the set of σ that commute with every τ (i.e., the center) equals the singleton containing the identity permutation. This is exactly the formalization of “the center is trivial.”
- The use of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` correctly models Sym_n; `Equiv.refl (Fin n)` is the identity permutation; the commuting condition uses composition (`trans`), which is the group operation for permutations, so it encodes being in the center. Although it does not use Mathlib’s `Subsemiring`/`Subgroup`-style `center` definition, the explicit set definition is precisely equivalent.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- Same quantifier on n and the condition n ≥ 3.
- Same group (Sym_n over n letters, modeled as permutations of Fin n).
- Same property (center equals {id}).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement itself is faithful. There is no mismatch or extra assumptions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

  Natural language: For any finite abelian (additive) group G, there exists a natural number n and a function f from {0, …, n-1} to ℕ such that G is additively isomorphic to the (finite) direct product over i of the cyclic groups ZMod (f i). Here ∀ i, ZMod (f i) is the dependent function type (i : Fin n) → ZMod (f i), which as an additive group is the finite direct product Π i, ZMod (f i). This matches the statement “is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups Z/nZ.” (Allowing ZMod 1 for the trivial cyclic factor is standard and harmless.)

- Theorem number_of_isomorphism_classes (n : ℕ) : ∃ (r : ℕ) (ks : Fin r → ℕ), True
  Natural language: For any natural number n, there exist a natural number r and a function ks : Fin r → ℕ such that True holds. This is vacuous; it asserts nothing substantive about isomorphism classes, prime-power factorizations, or partition numbers. The preceding comment explicitly calls it a placeholder.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- First part of the natural language statement (“Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups.”) is captured reasonably by the first theorem. It states existence of a finite product of cyclic groups ZMod (f i) isomorphic to G. That is a faithful formalization of the existence aspect (without uniqueness conditions, which the text also does not require).
- Second part (“If n = p_1^{k_1} … p_r^{k_r}, then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n is p(k_1) … p(k_r).”) is not formalized at all. The provided theorem is a trivial existential statement with True, and it does not mention prime power factorization, isomorphism classes, or the partition function. It is explicitly marked as an informal placeholder. This fails the translation of the second sentence.

Final check: The two math problems are different overall because the code only faithfully addresses the first sentence, while the second is replaced by a vacuous placeholder. No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced, but the second theorem is vacuous and does not match the intended statement.

Grade rationale: Not faithful overall because half the statement is missing/vacuous. However, the first part is a good formalization, so this is closer to “if fixed, it would be faithful” rather than completely unrelated. Hence a mid score.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `def A_n (n : ℕ) : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) := MonoidHom.ker (Equiv.Perm.sign (α := Fin n))`
  This defines the alternating group A_n as the kernel of the sign homomorphism from the permutation group on `Fin n` to the multiplicative group {±1}. This is the standard definition of A_n.

- The theorem `normal_subgroup_contains_point_stabilizers` has hypotheses:
  - `hn : 6 ≤ n`: n ≥ 6.
  - `N : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))`: N is a subgroup of the full symmetric group on n letters (represented as permutations of `Fin n`).
  - `hsub : N ≤ A_n n`: N is contained in A_n; i.e., N is a subgroup of A_n.
  - `hnormal : ∀ g ∈ A_n n, ∀ x ∈ N, g * x * g⁻¹ ∈ N`: N is normal in A_n (conjugation by elements of A_n preserves N).
  - `hproper : N ≠ A_n n`: N is a proper subgroup of A_n (strictly smaller than A_n).
  Conclusion:
  - `∀ i : Fin n, ∀ σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), σ ∈ A_n n → σ i = i → σ ∈ N`:
    For every point i and every permutation σ in A_n that fixes i, σ ∈ N. Equivalently, for each i, the point-stabilizer subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n | σ i = i} is contained in N.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Let n ≥ 6 and N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n. Show that N contains every subgroup G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i} for each i.
- The code exactly encodes: n ≥ 6, N ≤ A_n, N normal in A_n, N proper in A_n, and concludes G_i ⊆ N for each i. Using `Fin n` instead of {1, …, n} is a standard formal choice and is equivalent.
- Normality is correctly restricted to conjugation by elements of A_n (not all permutations), matching the phrase “normal subgroup of A_n.”
- The conclusion is stated elementwise, which is equivalent to the subgroup containment.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Indexing: `i : Fin n` versus `1 ≤ i ≤ n` is a minor formalization difference and standard; no semantic mismatch.
- Ambient group: N is a subgroup of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` with an inclusion `N ≤ A_n n`, matching “subgroup of A_n.”
- All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (A_n as kernel of sign); no vacuous placeholders.
- No extraneous or missing conditions relevant to the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  • Given an additive subgroup `H` of the integers, there exists an integer `n` such that the underlying set of `H` equals the set of all integers `m` for which there exists an integer `k` with `m = n * k`.
  • Equivalently: every additive subgroup `H` of `ℤ` is exactly the set of multiples of some integer `n`, i.e., `H = nℤ`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that the subgroups of (ℤ, +) are exactly the subgroups nℤ for integers n."" The Lean statement asserts that for any additive subgroup `H` of `ℤ`, there exists an integer `n` such that `H` (as a set) equals `{m | ∃k, m = n*k}`.
- This matches the classification: `nℤ` is precisely the set of integer multiples of `n`. Using integers for `n` (rather than naturals) is acceptable, since `nℤ = (-n)ℤ` and the statement did not require uniqueness or a nonnegativity convention.
- The statement is made at the level of sets (the carrier of the subgroup), which is standard and equivalent to saying the subgroup equals `nℤ` because subgroups of `ℤ` are determined by their underlying sets.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the only content is the theorem statement. The proof is elided with `sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing the translation.

Final check for discrepancies:
- No substantive differences: the set `{ m | ∃ k, m = n * k }` is exactly `nℤ`.
- No unnecessary restrictions (e.g., `n ≥ 0`) were imposed; the natural statement allowed integers.
- Hence the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- There exists a group isomorphism from G to `Multiplicative (ZMod (2 * p))`, i.e., G is cyclic of order 2p (since `ZMod (2*p)` as an additive group is cyclic of order 2p, and `Multiplicative` is the standard wrapper to view it as a multiplicative group), or
- There exists a group isomorphism from G to `DihedralGroup p`, the dihedral group of order 2p.

No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the code relies on standard Mathlib structures: `ZMod`, `Multiplicative`, and `DihedralGroup`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: If |G| = 2p with p an odd prime, then G is isomorphic to either Z_{2p} or D_p. The Lean statement exactly captures this by:
- Requiring G to be a finite group with `Fintype G` and `Fintype.card G = 2 * p`.
- Requiring p to be prime and not equal to 2 (i.e., odd).
- Concluding that G is isomorphic either to the cyclic group of order 2p (represented as `Multiplicative (ZMod (2 * p))`) or to the dihedral group of order 2p (`DihedralGroup p`).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The use of `Multiplicative (ZMod (2*p))` is the standard Lean way to express the cyclic group of order 2p as a multiplicative group, matching Z_{2p}.
- `DihedralGroup p` in Mathlib denotes the dihedral group of order 2p, matching D_p in the natural language statement.
- The hypothesis `p ≠ 2` is equivalent to “p is odd” given `p.Prime`.
- No extraneous assumptions; no vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for an arbitrary natural number n: `theorem exists_primitive_root_units_zmod_iff (n : ℕ) : ...`.
- The left-hand side is `IsCyclic (Units (ZMod n))`, which asserts that the multiplicative group of units modulo n (i.e., Z_n^×) is cyclic. This is exactly the group-theoretic formulation of “there exists a primitive root modulo n,” since a primitive root modulo n is a generator of this group.
- The right-hand side is a disjunction of cases: `n = 2 ∨ n = 4 ∨ (∃ p t, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ 1 ≤ t ∧ n = p ^ t) ∨ (∃ p t, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ 1 ≤ t ∧ n = 2 * p ^ t)`.
  - This corresponds to: n equals 2, or 4, or a prime power p^t with p prime and p ≠ 2 (i.e., p is an odd prime) and t ≥ 1, or twice such a prime power (2 p^t) with t ≥ 1.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says there is a primitive root in Z_n^× if and only if n ∈ {2, 4, p^t, 2 p^t} with p an odd prime. The Lean statement encodes exactly this equivalence via the cyclicity of Units (ZMod n), which is the standard equivalence between existence of a primitive root modulo n and cyclicity of the unit group.
- The condition “p is an odd prime” is rendered as `Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≠ 2`, which is correct.
- The exponent condition is explicitly `1 ≤ t`, matching the intended reading of p^t and 2 p^t with positive exponent.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct formalization of the classification.

Final check:
- The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement. A possible subtlety is that some versions of the classification include n = 1, but the provided natural language statement does not; the Lean statement also excludes n = 1, so it matches the given statement exactly.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def rot_matrix (a b : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix whose entries are [[a, −b], [b, a]]. The index tests `i = 0`, `j = 0` correctly pick out these entries for `i, j : Fin 2`.
- `def G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { A | ∃ a b, A = rot_matrix a b }` defines G as the set of all matrices of that form. This faithfully matches the intended set in the natural language statement.
- `noncomputable def G_addsub : AddSubgroup (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := by sorry` claims to define an additive subgroup of 2×2 real matrices. However, there are two issues: (1) it is given by `sorry`, so it is an admitted placeholder (vacuous). (2) The type alone does not guarantee that the carrier of this `AddSubgroup` is exactly the set `G`; without an explicit construction showing `carrier = G` and closure under addition and negation, this does not establish that G is a group under addition.
- `noncomputable def complex_add_equiv_G : AddEquiv Complex (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := by sorry` claims an additive isomorphism from `(ℂ, +)` to the entire space of 2×2 real matrices, not to `G`. The docstring says “as a subtype,” but the type is `AddEquiv Complex (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)`, which is an isomorphism with all 2×2 real matrices (ℝ^4 as an additive group), not the intended subgroup `G` (which is isomorphic to ℝ^2). This is a mismatch even before noting the `sorry` placeholder.

Whole translation vs. the original statement:
- The natural language asks to prove G is a group under matrix addition and construct an isomorphism `(ℂ, +) ≅ G`.
- The code correctly specifies G as the set of matrices of the desired form, but does not actually build the additive subgroup structure on that set; instead it provides an admitted `AddSubgroup` with no link to `G`. Thus it fails to state (let alone prove) that G is a group under addition.
- The isomorphism is incorrectly typed: it targets the entire matrix space instead of the subgroup `G` (or its subtype/carrier). Therefore, even if the `sorry` were replaced by a proof term, it would be the wrong mathematical claim.

Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code with `sorry` placeholders is vacuous for the crucial constructions, and the isomorphism target is wrong. Hence it is not a faithful translation of the problem.

Grade rationale:
- There is a correct definition of the set G and of the canonical matrix form, but the key constructions are admitted via `sorry`, and the isomorphism is misstated. This warrants a low score. According to the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful” due to the wrong codomain of the AddEquiv.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The theorem `center_of_p_group` is stated for a type `G` with a group structure `[Group G]` and finite cardinality `[Fintype G]`.
- Parameters: `p : ℕ`, `r : ℕ` with `hp : Nat.Prime p`, `hr : Fintype.card G = p ^ r` (so |G| = p^r), and `hrpos : 1 ≤ r`.
- There is an additional explicit hypothesis `hcenter : Fintype (Subgroup.center G)`, asserting the center is finite. In fact, this is automatically true given `[Fintype G]`, but here it is included explicitly.
- Conclusion: There exists `k : ℕ` with `1 ≤ k` and `Fintype.card (Subgroup.center G) = p ^ k`.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but our job is to check the statement, not the proof.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If G is a group of order p^r with p prime and r ≥ 1, then |Z(G)| = p^k for some integer k ≥ 1.
- Lean statement matches: It assumes |G| = p^r, p prime, r ≥ 1, and concludes that the cardinality of the center equals p^k with k ≥ 1.
- The extra hypothesis `hcenter : Fintype (Subgroup.center G)` is redundant because the center of a finite group is finite; it does not change the mathematical content.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; all terms are from Mathlib.
- The conclusion exactly matches the intended mathematical statement (with k a natural number and k ≥ 1).
- The only minor technical deviation is the explicit finiteness hypothesis on the center, which is automatically satisfied and thus harmless.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Setup importing Mathlib and opening the Matrix namespace.
- Comment: States the intended classical result and announces a placeholder predicate `is_elementary_matrix`.
- `def is_elementary_matrix {n : Nat} (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) : Prop := True`: Defines a predicate intended to mean “M is an elementary matrix,” but it is set to `True` for all matrices. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not capture the intended concept.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem nonsingular_real_matrix_is_product_of_elementary_matrices {n : Nat} (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) (h : A.det ≠ 0) : ∃ (E : List (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)), (∀ M ∈ E, is_elementary_matrix (M)) ∧ A = E.foldr (fun M acc => M * acc) 1 := by sorry`
  Natural language translation: For an n×n real matrix A with det(A) ≠ 0, there exists a finite list E of n×n real matrices such that every M in E satisfies `is_elementary_matrix M` and A equals the product of the matrices in E (using a right fold with multiplication and identity). Since `is_elementary_matrix` is defined as `True`, the condition on E is vacuous; the statement reduces to “there exists a finite list of matrices whose product is A,” which is trivially satisfied (e.g., E = [A]).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The original statement: Any nonsingular n×n real matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.
- The Lean code uses det(A) ≠ 0 to denote nonsingular, works over real n×n matrices, and expresses existence of a list whose product equals A. However, the crucial notion “elementary matrices” is replaced by a vacuous predicate `True`. Therefore, the condition that the factors are elementary is not enforced.
- Consequently, the theorem as stated in Lean is strictly weaker and essentially trivial; it does not capture the intended mathematical content.

Final comparison:
- Same aspects: domain (real n×n matrices), nonsingularity (det ≠ 0), product representation.
- Critical difference: the Lean code does not actually require the matrices in the product to be elementary; it uses a vacuous predicate. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Given the rubric: It makes up a vacuous auxiliary definition; if that were replaced by a legitimate definition of elementary matrices, the final theorem statement would match the natural language statement. So it fits the “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, the statement would be faithful” category.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- The theorem is named `srdoty_alg_cosets_492` over a type `G` with a `Group` structure and subgroups `H` and `K`.
- `[Fintype H] [Fintype K]`: Assumes `H` and `K` are finite subgroups.
- `{m n : Nat}` and hypotheses `hm : Fintype.card H = m`, `hn : Fintype.card K = n`: Introduce natural numbers `m` and `n` equal to the cardinalities of `H` and `K` respectively.
- `gcd1 : Nat.gcd m n = 1`: The orders `m` and `n` are coprime.
- Conclusion: `((H : Set G) ∩ (K : Set G) = ({1} : Set G))`: The set-theoretic intersection of the carrier sets of `H` and `K` is exactly the singleton set containing the identity `1 : G`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let `H` and `K` be finite subgroups of a group `G` with `|H| = m` and `|K| = n`. If `gcd(m, n) = 1`, then `H ∩ K = {1}`.
- The Lean statement matches this exactly: it assumes finiteness via `[Fintype H] [Fintype K]`, identifies `m` and `n` with the cardinalities, assumes `gcd(m, n) = 1`, and concludes the intersection equals the singleton `{1}`. Using set intersection and `{1}` as the singleton set of the identity is a standard formalization of “the intersection is trivial.” There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is direct.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Slight formalization choice: expresses intersection/equality as sets rather than subgroups (i.e., `H ⊓ K = ⊥`). This is equivalent in this context.
- No extra or missing hypotheses; the quantification and data `m, n` with `|H| = m`, `|K| = n` is properly captured by `hm`, `hn`.
- Proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable per instructions, as we only audit the statement translation.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and precise translation of the natural language statement.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code to natural language:

1) Theorem `perm_isConj_iff_cycleType`:
- Lean: For σ, τ : Perm (Fin n), `IsConj σ τ ↔ σ.cycleType = τ.cycleType`.
- Natural language: Two permutations in S_n are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type. This matches the first sentence of the statement (noting that `Perm (Fin n)` is S_n). In mathlib, `IsConj` is the usual group-theoretic conjugacy and `cycleType` is the multiset of cycle lengths (in mathlib, it typically excludes 1-cycles, but for fixed n this still classifies conjugacy because the number of 1-cycles is determined by n). So this part is faithful.

2) Definition `conjClasses_equiv_cycle_types`:
- Lean: A noncomputable equivalence `ConjClasses (Perm (Fin n)) ≃ { m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n }`.
- Intended natural language: The conjugacy classes of S_n are in bijection with the partitions of n.
- Discrepancy: `{ m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n }` in Lean allows 0 as a part and does not enforce positivity. This is not the usual notion of integer partitions (which are multisets of positive integers summing to n), and moreover, allowing zeros makes the right-hand side infinite (you can add arbitrarily many zeros without changing the sum). Also, mathlib’s `cycleType` typically omits 1-cycles, so even aside from positivity, the direct target should account for the number of 1’s separately (though for fixed n, that can be recovered as n minus the sum of the positive cycle lengths). Thus, as stated, this equivalence does not faithfully represent “partitions of n.” Mathlib also has dedicated types/counts for partitions (e.g., `Nat.Partition`/`Nat.partitions n`) that should be used instead.

3) Theorem `num_conj_classes_eq_num_partitions`:
- Lean: `Nat.card (ConjClasses (Perm (Fin n))) = Nat.card { m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n }`.
- Intended natural language: The number of conjugacy classes equals the number of partitions of n.
- Discrepancy: Same issue as above. The right-hand side type is not the set of partitions (positive parts), and it is in fact infinite because of zeros, making `Nat.card` equal to 0 for infinite types. Hence, this does not match the intended statement and is actually false for n ≥ 1.

Whole translation faithfulness:
- The first theorem faithfully captures the “conjugate iff same cycle type” part.
- The subsequent equivalence and cardinality statements attempt to formalize the bijection with partitions but use `{ m : Multiset Nat // m.sum = n }`, which is not the set of (integer) partitions of n. This is a significant mismatch: it fails to impose positivity and also doesn’t account for the fact that `cycleType` typically omits fixed points. Consequently, the second and third statements are not faithful translations.

Final check:
- Original: Conjugacy classes in S_n are labeled by partitions of n (multisets of positive integers summing to n), and the number of conjugacy classes equals the number of partitions of n.
- Lean: Claims a bijection and cardinality equality with all multisets of natural numbers summing to n, allowing zeros, which is not the same and leads to incorrect cardinality behavior.

Conclusion: Not faithful overall, despite the first theorem being correct. To fix, target a proper partition type (e.g., `Nat.Partition`, or multisets of positive integers summing to n) and be consistent with mathlib’s `cycleType` conventions.

- `variables {F : Type*} [Field F] {n : Type*} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]` sets up a field F and an index type n with decidable equality and finitely many elements. This is the standard setup for matrices indexed by a finite type n, needed to define determinants.

    sorry`
  translates to: For any subgroup G of GL_n(F) (here modeled as the group of units of the ring of n×n matrices over F), there exists a subgroup H of GL_n(F) such that for every invertible matrix A, A belongs to H if and only if A belongs to G and its determinant is either 1 or −1. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; only the statement matters for translation.
  The coercion `(A : Matrix n n F)` extracts the underlying matrix from the unit A so that `det` can be applied.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let F be a field, G ≤ GL_n(F), and define H = {A ∈ G : det A = ±1}. Prove H is a subgroup of G.
- Lean: Asserts existence of a subgroup H of GL_n(F) whose elements are exactly those A in G with det A = 1 or det A = −1.
- This matches the intended definition of H and asserts it is a subgroup (by producing it as a `Subgroup` with exactly that membership characterization). Although the Lean statement phrases H as a subgroup of GL_n(F) rather than explicitly ""a subgroup of G"", the membership condition `A ∈ H ↔ A ∈ G ∧ ...` immediately implies H ⊆ G, hence H is indeed a subgroup of G in the usual sense. Thus the translation is faithful.
- The Lean code uses a slightly more general indexing set `n : Type*` with `[Fintype n]` instead of a natural number n, which is a standard generalization and does not change the mathematical content.

3) Final comparison:
- Are the two problems the same? Yes. The code formalizes the existence of H as a subgroup (of GL_n(F)) consisting exactly of elements of G with determinant ±1, which is equivalent to ""define H = {A ∈ G : det A = ±1} and show H is a subgroup of G."" There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; only the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `inductive ElemRowOp (R : Type u) (n : Nat)` with constructors `swap (i j)`, `scale (i) (c)`, and `addMul (i j) (c)`: This introduces a custom type meant to represent the three usual kinds of elementary row operations on n×n matrices over R: swapping two rows, scaling a row by a scalar c, and adding c times one row to another.
  - Potential discrepancy: The usual definition of elementary row operations typically restricts scaling to nonzero scalars (so the operation is invertible), and often requires i ≠ j for addMul. This type imposes no such constraints, allowing e.g. scaling by 0 or i = j.

- `axiom applyElemRowOp ... : ElemRowOp R n → Matrix ... R → Matrix ... R`: This postulates (as an axiom) a function that applies a given elementary row op to a matrix, returning a new matrix. It is not defined; it is an unspecified placeholder.

- `axiom elemMatrixOfOp ... : ElemRowOp R n → Matrix ... R`: This postulates (as an axiom) a function that returns the corresponding elementary matrix for a given op (presumably op applied to the identity). Again, it is not defined; it is an unspecified placeholder.

- Theorem `elementary_row_op_left_mul ... (h : B = applyElemRowOp op A) : B = (elemMatrixOfOp op) * A := by sorry`: The statement says: for any semiring R and natural number n, if B is obtained from A by applying an elementary row operation op (expressed as B = applyElemRowOp op A), then B equals U*A where U is the corresponding elementary matrix (elemMatrixOfOp op). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The high-level shape of the statement matches the natural language claim: if B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, then B = U*A where U is the corresponding elementary matrix.
- However, there are serious issues:
  1) The key functions `applyElemRowOp` and `elemMatrixOfOp` are introduced as axioms with no definitions or properties. They are placeholders, not Mathlib constructs, and do not faithfully encode the intended meanings. This violates the guideline against vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions.
  2) The code does not use Mathlib’s existing notions of elementary matrices/operations, which likely exist (e.g., Matrix elementary constructs). This is another red flag per the guideline to use applicable Mathlib terms.
  3) The allowed operations in `ElemRowOp` include degenerate cases (e.g., scaling by 0, or i=j), which usually are not considered elementary row operations in standard linear algebra texts. This is a mismatch with the conventional meaning of “elementary.”
  4) The natural language statement restricts to positive integers n; the code allows n = 0. This is a small generalization and would be acceptable on its own, but combined with the above issues it doesn’t rescue faithfulness.
  5) The theorem proof is `sorry`, which is acceptable for our translation audit (we only check the statement), but coupled with the axioms it underscores the placeholder nature.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Formally, the theorem’s logical structure mirrors the natural statement, but crucial semantic content is pushed into two axiomatic placeholders (`applyElemRowOp` and `elemMatrixOfOp`) with no definitions, and the operation set differs from the standard (possibly allowing non-invertible operations). Hence the translation is not faithful under the guidelines.

Given that the placeholders are vacuous and non-Mathlib, but if replaced with proper definitions the final theorem would match the claim (modulo minor differences like positivity and nonzero scalars), this fits the rubric for grade 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient group is the symmetric group on Fin n, i.e., Equiv.Perm (Fin n). The alternating group A_n is alternatingGroup (Fin n) as a subgroup of this.
- Hypotheses:
  - hn : 6 ≤ n. This matches the n ≥ 6 condition.
  - i : Fin n. This is the chosen index i in {0,…,n-1}, corresponding to {1,…,n} up to reindexing.
  - N : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)). This is a subgroup of the full symmetric group.
  - hN_in_A : ∀ σ, σ ∈ N → σ ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n). This says N ⊆ A_n.
  - hN_normal : ∀ g τ, g ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) → τ ∈ N → g * τ * g⁻¹ ∈ N. This says N is normal in A_n (normality under conjugation by elements of A_n).
  - hN_proper : N ≠ ⊤. Here ⊤ is the whole symmetric group S_n, so this says N is not all of S_n.
- Conclusion:
  - ∀ σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), σ i = i → σ ∈ alternatingGroup (Fin n) → σ ∈ N. That is, every even permutation fixing i lies in N. Equivalently, the point stabilizer in A_n at i (G_i = {σ ∈ A_n | σ i = i}) is contained in N.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let n ≥ 6 and N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n. For fixed i, define G_i as the subgroup of A_n fixing i. Show N contains G_i.
- The code captures: n ≥ 6; N is a subgroup contained in A_n (hN_in_A); N is normal in A_n (hN_normal); and the conclusion G_i ⊆ N. This matches the heart of the statement.
- The only mismatch is the notion of “proper”: the natural language requires N ≠ A_n (proper as a subgroup of A_n), while the code assumes N ≠ ⊤ (i.e., N ≠ S_n). Given hN_in_A, N ⊆ A_n, this assumption is weaker and in fact redundant when n ≥ 2, since any subgroup of A_n is automatically not equal to S_n. The code therefore allows the case N = A_n, which would still make the conclusion true but does not enforce “proper in A_n.” Thus the Lean statement is a slight generalization of the natural statement.

3) Final check:
- Are the two problems the same? Almost: all structural components (n ≥ 6, N ≤ A_n, N normal in A_n, conclusion G_i ⊆ N) match. The only difference is the formalization of “proper”: the code uses N ≠ S_n rather than N ≠ A_n. This is a weaker condition and allows N = A_n, but does not invalidate the intended claim and indeed yields a slightly more general theorem. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary hypotheses precisely encode inclusion in and normality within A_n. Hence the translation is faithful up to this minor generalization.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We work with n×n matrices where n is a finite index type (so matrices are of size n by n), with decidable equality on indices (standard for defining the identity matrix).
- `variable {R : Type _} [Semiring R]`: The scalar entries lie in a semiring R (generalizing the reals).
- The theorem `matrix_group_has_one` takes a set `G : Set (Matrix n n R)` and assumes:
  - `h_nonempty : G.Nonempty`: G is nonempty.
  - `h_mul_closed : ∀ A B, A ∈ G → B ∈ G → A * B ∈ G`: G is closed under matrix multiplication.
  - `h_inv_closed : ∀ A, A ∈ G → ∃ B, B ∈ G ∧ A * B = 1 ∧ B * A = 1`: For every A in G, there exists a two-sided inverse B (satisfying AB = BA = I) that also lies in G.
- Conclusion: `(1 : Matrix n n R) ∈ G`: the identity matrix belongs to G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) be nonempty and closed under products and inverses (a matrix group). Prove I ∈ G.
- The Lean statement captures exactly this structure, with a slight generalization:
  - It allows matrices over an arbitrary semiring R rather than ℝ, which is a standard benign generalization.
  - It formalizes “closed under inverses” via the existence of a two-sided inverse B for each A ∈ G with AB = BA = 1 and B ∈ G; this matches the intended meaning in the noncommutative matrix setting and ensures the identity can be formed as A*B.
  - Nonemptiness is explicitly assumed, as in the natural statement, and is necessary to produce A, B witnessing the identity in G via closure under multiplication.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - Generalization from real matrices to matrices over an arbitrary semiring R: acceptable and faithful to the core statement.
  - Dimension n is a finite index type rather than a natural number size: standard formulation in Lean and equivalent for the purpose.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the hypotheses match the intended properties; no proofs are required. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language claim.

Conclusion: The code is a legitimate and faithful translation of the statement (with a harmless generalization), so it passes.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem sym_group_generated_by_transposition_and_ncycle (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) [NeZero n] :` 
  For a natural number n with n ≥ 2 and n ≠ 0 (the latter is redundant but harmless),
- `∃ c : Equiv.Perm (Fin n),` 
  there exists a permutation c of Fin n (so a permutation of an n-element set),
- `Subgroup.closure ({Equiv.swap (0 : Fin n) (1 : Fin n), c} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)))` 
  such that the subgroup generated (closure) by the set consisting of the transposition swapping 0 and 1 and the permutation c is the whole symmetric group on n letters.

This asserts: for each n ≥ 2, there exists some permutation c of {0,1,...,n-1} such that together with the transposition (0 1) it generates all of Sym_n.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
The original statement says: Let n ≥ 2. Prove that Sym_n is generated by the set S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}. That is, the specific two elements (the transposition (1 2) and the specific n-cycle (1 2 ... n)) generate Sym_n.

The Lean statement differs crucially: it only claims existence of some c (with no restriction that c is the n-cycle), such that { (0 1), c } generates the group. It does not assert that c is the specific n-cycle; it does not even assert that c is a cycle at all. The indexing difference (0-based in Lean vs 1-based in the statement) is immaterial. The extra `[NeZero n]` is a harmless technical assumption implied by n ≥ 2.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are different. The Lean theorem is strictly weaker than the natural language statement: the latter specifies the generator c must be the n-cycle (1 2 ... n), while the Lean theorem only asserts there exists some permutation c making the pair generate Sym_n. The natural statement implies the Lean theorem, but not conversely. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def gl (n : Type _) [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] := { A : Matrix n n Real // Matrix.det A ≠ 0 }`
  Natural language: For any finite index type n, define GL(n, R) as the subtype of n×n real matrices with nonzero determinant. This matches the set {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(R) | det A ≠ 0}. Using a general finite index type n is a harmless generalization of n ∈ ℕ.

- `instance {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] : Group (gl n) := by sorry`
  Natural language: Assert that GL(n, R) has a group structure. However, the instance is provided entirely by `sorry`, so the multiplication, identity, inverse, and all group axioms are not actually defined/proved. Moreover, it does not explicitly tie the group operation to matrix multiplication; the whole structure (both data and proofs) is a placeholder.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement asks to show that GL(n) = {A : Mat_{n×n}(R) | det A ≠ 0} is a group under matrix multiplication. The code correctly defines the underlying set as a subtype of matrices with nonzero determinant. However, the group structure is introduced via a `sorry` instance, which is a vacuous placeholder. This fails to specify the intended operation (matrix multiplication restricted to the subtype), fails to construct the identity and inverse elements, and fails to prove the axioms. Under the auditing guidelines, this is not acceptable.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Similarities: The underlying set matches GL(n) as the set of real matrices with nonzero determinant; using a finite index type n is a standard generalization.
- Differences/problems:
  - The key claim ""is a group under matrix multiplication"" is not actually implemented: the group structure is left as `sorry`, so it could be anything and is not tied to matrix multiplication.
  - Because the instance is wholly vacuous, the translation is not legitimate per the guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous group instance. If the instance were properly constructed using matrix multiplication, identity matrix, and inverses (with appropriate proofs), it would be faithful. As-is, it fails.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: For any 2×2 improper orthogonal matrix H (H ∈ O(2) and det H = −1), the matrices H0 H and H H0 belong to SO(2). Membership in SO(2) is precisely: orthogonal and determinant 1. The code encodes the hypotheses H ∈ O(2) via Hᵀ * H = 1 and det H = −1, and the conclusions exactly state orthogonality and determinant 1 for both products. H0 is correctly defined as the reflection across the x-axis diag(1, −1).
- While the code does not explicitly use the SpecialOrthogonalGroup type, it states the defining properties of SO(2), which is a faithful restatement.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions: H0 is concrete, and the theorem statement is precise. The presence of 'sorry' for the proof is acceptable per the task; we only audit the statement.

Final check:

- `def O (n : Nat) := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // A * Aᵀ = 1}`: This defines O(n) as the subtype of n×n real matrices A such that A Aᵀ = I. This matches the set description in the natural language statement (orthogonal matrices defined by A A^T = I).
- `instance O_group (n : Nat) : Group (O n) := by ... sorry`: This claims that O(n) has a group structure. The comment says the group operation is matrix multiplication, the inverse is Aᵀ, and suggests using (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T to prove the group axioms. However, the entire instance is filled by `sorry`, so no actual operations (mul, one, inv) are specified.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original claim is: Using the listed identities, prove that O(n) is a group under matrix multiplication (i.e., closure under the usual matrix product, identity is I, inverses are transposes, associativity inherited).
- The code correctly defines the set O(n).
- The code then asserts there is a Group instance on O(n), but crucially does not specify that the group operation is the inherited matrix multiplication, nor that the inverse is transpose, nor that the identity is the identity matrix. Because the entire structure is provided via `sorry`, the operation fields (`mul`, `one`, `inv`, etc.) are left as placeholders and could be anything. Thus, the Lean statement does not encode “under matrix multiplication” — it merely asserts the existence of some group structure on O(n).
- Comments are not part of the formal content, so they do not rescue the lack of formal specification.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The natural language statement asserts a specific group structure (from matrix multiplication) and outlines the method of proof. The Lean code’s final instance does not capture that specificity; it provides a vacuous group instance with unspecified operations. Therefore, the problems are different in a critical way: the code fails to formalize “under matrix multiplication,” making the translation not faithful.

Additional notes:
- The auxiliary definition `O` is legitimate and faithful.
- The failure lies in the group instance being entirely `sorry` and not pinning down the multiplication as matrix multiplication. If the instance had specified `mul := fun A B => ⟨A.1 ⬝ B.1, ...⟩`, `one := ⟨1, ...⟩`, `inv := fun A => ⟨Aᵀ, ...⟩` and so on (with proofs possibly `sorry`), then it would be faithful. As is, the key ""under matrix multiplication"" part is not encoded.

Given this, the translation does not pass.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and matrix notation.
- `def MyGL (n : Type _) [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] : Type _ := { A : Matrix n n ℝ // IsUnit A }`
  This defines “GL(n)” as the subtype of n×n real matrices that are units (invertible). Here `n` is a finite index type; using `IsUnit` faithfully captures invertibility over ℝ.
- `def MyO (n : Type _) [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] : Set (MyGL n) := { A : MyGL n | (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ) * (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ)ᵀ = 1 }`
  This defines “O(n)” as the subset of `MyGL n` consisting of those invertible matrices whose product with their transpose equals the identity matrix (written as `1` in Lean, which is the identity matrix). The coercion `A.1` extracts the underlying matrix from the subtype.
- `theorem MyO_eq ... : MyO n = { A : MyGL n | (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ) * (A.1 : Matrix n n ℝ)ᵀ = 1 } := by sorry`
  This asserts that the defined `MyO n` equals the set of invertible matrices satisfying `A Aᵀ = I`. This is literally restating its definition, so it's definitional equality.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that O(n) = {A in GL(n): A A^T = I}.” The code defines `MyO n` exactly as that set, and then states the equality `MyO n = { ... }`. Thus, the formalization captures precisely the statement.

Final comparison and discrepancies:
- Minor formalization details: `1` is used for the identity matrix instead of `I`; `n` is a finite index type rather than a natural number; invertibility is expressed via `IsUnit`. All are standard and faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; both `MyGL` and `MyO` are legitimate.
- The theorem is a definitional restatement (would be proved by `rfl`), which matches the nature of the natural language statement as an equality/definition.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the given statement.

- Domain: Field F in both statements — match.
- Definition of E(t): Exactly the same matrix — match.
- Conclusion: `(E t)⁻¹ = E (-t)` for all t — match.
No discrepancies or vacuous placeholders. The code uses standard Mathlib constructs and the statements are precise translations of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context fixes an index type n with [Fintype n] and [DecidableEq n], and a base ring R with [CommRing R]. Matrices considered are n×n over R.
- The theorem states: There exists a subgroup H of Units (Matrix n n R) (i.e., of GL(n, R) modeled as units in the matrix ring) such that for any unit u (i.e., invertible matrix), membership u ∈ H is equivalent to the property that all off-diagonal entries are zero: ∀ i j, i ≠ j → (u : Matrix n n R) i j = 0.
- In words: There is a subgroup of the general linear group consisting exactly of the diagonal invertible matrices.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines D(n) as the set of all diagonal matrices in GL(n) and asks to show D(n) is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup of GL(n)).
- The Lean statement asserts the existence of a Subgroup H ⊆ Units (Matrix n n R) whose elements are precisely those invertible matrices with zero off-diagonal entries; that is exactly the set of diagonal matrices within GL(n). Thus it formalizes that D(n) is a subgroup of GL(n).
- The ambient group Units (Matrix n n R) is a standard formalization of GL(n, R). Requiring R to be a CommRing is a harmless specialization/generalization aspect; the statement holds over any (commutative) ring and matches the intended context (often a field). The index type n with Fintype replaces a natural-number dimension; this is standard in Mathlib and faithful.
- No auxiliary placeholder definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement (with an omitted proof), which is acceptable per the instructions.

Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. The code precisely captures “the set of diagonal matrices in GL(n) forms a subgroup,” phrased as the existence of a subgroup characterized by the diagonal property. No discrepancies in meaning; it is even slightly more general in allowing any finite index type and commutative ring, which is acceptable.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We work with n×n matrices where the index type n is finite with decidable equality (Mathlib’s standard way to represent n×n matrices).
- `theorem SL_is_subgroup {R : Type _} [CommRing R] : ∃ H : Subgroup ((Matrix n n R)ˣ), H.carrier = { u : (Matrix n n R)ˣ | Matrix.det (u : Matrix n n R) = 1 } := by sorry`:
  This asserts that for any commutative ring R, there exists a subgroup H of the group of units of the matrix ring such that the underlying set (carrier) of H is exactly the set of invertible matrices u whose determinant (computed on the underlying matrix of u) equals 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Show that SL(n) = {A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A = 1} is a group under matrix multiplication.” This is the usual statement that the special linear group is a subgroup of the general linear group (i.e., the set of invertible matrices with determinant 1 forms a group under multiplication).
- The Lean code frames this as: the set of units (invertible matrices) with determinant 1 is a subgroup of the group of units. This is the standard formalization: a group structure on matrices under multiplication is only available on the units; showing the det=1 subset is a subgroup exactly captures “is a group under matrix multiplication.”
- The code generalizes ℝ to any commutative ring R and allows a general finite index type n instead of a natural number dimension; both are standard slight generalizations and do not change the mathematical content.
- The fact that the set is phrased as units rather than all matrices is appropriate: over a commutative ring, det A = 1 implies A is invertible (hence a unit), so the set {A | det A = 1} coincides with the set of units whose underlying matrix has det 1. Thus, the typed formulation as a subset of units is faithful to the intended subset of matrices.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: SL(n, ℝ) is a group under multiplication.
- Lean: The subset of invertible matrices over R with determinant 1 is a subgroup of the units. This is precisely the same claim (with slight, acceptable generalization to any commutative ring and to index type n). No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is exactly the desired property. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is allowed for this auditing task.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix BigOperators`: Just setup.
- The theorem `orthogonal_matrix_cols_orthonormal {n : Nat} (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) (h : Matrix.transpose A * A = 1) : ∀ i j : Fin n, (∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j) = if i = j then 1 else 0` says: For a real n×n matrix A with Aᵀ A = I, for all indices i, j, the sum over k of A k i times A k j equals 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise. Interpreting A k i as the k-th coordinate of the i-th column, this sum is the Euclidean inner product of the i-th and j-th columns. Thus the conclusion is exactly that the columns are orthonormal (pairwise orthogonal and unit length).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If A ∈ O(n), with columns A₁, …, Aₙ, deduce that {A₁, …, Aₙ} is an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ.
- The hypothesis `Aᵀ A = I` is equivalent to A ∈ O(n), so the assumption matches.
- The conclusion in the code proves the columns are orthonormal (their inner products give the Kronecker delta). However, it stops short of stating that these vectors form a basis. The natural language statement asks to deduce that they form an orthonormal basis, which includes both orthonormality and that they span (or are a basis). While orthonormality of n vectors in ℝⁿ indeed implies they form a basis, the code does not include this basis claim.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- They are close but not identical. The Lean statement establishes orthonormality of columns, but does not assert the basis property. The original statement explicitly claims that the columns constitute an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ. Hence, the Lean code is missing the “basis” part of the conclusion.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions and an equivalent characterization of orthogonality. The mismatch is only the missing basis conclusion.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem is_field_iff_nonzero_units {R : Type*} [Semiring R] : IsField R ↔ (Nontrivial R ∧ ∀ a : R, a ≠ 0 → IsUnit a) := by sorry`
  This states: For a type R equipped with a Semiring structure, R is a field (IsField R) if and only if R is nontrivial and every nonzero element of R is a unit (i.e., invertible under multiplication). The proof is omitted.
  The surrounding docstring explains the intended meaning: equating the usual field axioms with the statement that (R,+) is an abelian group, (R \ {0}, *) is a multiplicative group, 1 ≠ 0, and distributivity, noting that several of these are recorded in semiring/ring typeclasses.

2) Comparing to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: F is a field iff (1) (F,+) is an abelian group with identity 0; (2) (F \ {0},·) is an abelian group with identity 1; (3) 1 ≠ 0; and (4) distributivity a(b+c) = ab + ac for all a,b,c.
- In a faithful Lean formalization, (1) and (4) would be provided by a [Ring]/[CommRing] structure (additive abelian group and distributivity), (2) would follow from commutative multiplication together with the statement that every nonzero is a unit, and (3) is 1 ≠ 0 (often encoded via Nontrivial R in the presence of semiring/ring axioms).

3) Discrepancies:
- The code assumes only `[Semiring R]`. A Semiring does not have additive inverses (so (1) fails: (R,+) is not guaranteed to be an abelian group) and multiplication need not be commutative (so (2) may only give a multiplicative group on R \ {0}, but not necessarily abelian). Therefore, the right-hand side of the equivalence in the code (Nontrivial + all nonzero are units) under a mere semiring structure corresponds to a division semiring/ring-like condition, not necessarily a field (commutative division ring).
- The natural language requirement that (F \ {0},·) is an abelian group explicitly demands commutativity of multiplication on nonzero elements; the code’s statement does not ensure this unless one assumes commutativity via `[CommSemiring R]`/`[CommRing R]`.
- The natural language requires (R,+) to be an abelian group. `[Semiring R]` provides only a commutative additive monoid (no additive inverses). The code does not assume additive inverses.
- On (3): The code uses `Nontrivial R`. In a semiring, `Nontrivial R` does indeed imply `0 ≠ 1`, and conversely if `0 = 1`, the structure collapses to subsingleton, so using `Nontrivial` to encode `1 ≠ 0` is acceptable. But this is a comparatively minor point compared to the missing ring/commutativity structure.

Conclusion: As written, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language characterization of a field. It would be made faithful by strengthening the typeclass assumptions to `[CommRing R]` (or at least `[Ring R]` plus separately assuming commutativity of multiplication) and then stating the standard equivalence `IsField R ↔ (Nontrivial R ∧ ∀ a ≠ 0, IsUnit a)`. Without these, it characterizes something closer to a (possibly noncommutative) division ring-like condition and does not capture (1) and (2) as stated.

Suggested fix: change `[Semiring R]` to `[CommRing R]` (or include the appropriate ring/commutativity assumptions) so that the hidden axioms (additive abelian group, distributivity, commutative multiplication) align with the four listed conditions.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Type _} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: We work with n×n real matrices indexed by an arbitrary finite type n with decidable equality (a standard generalization of the usual Nat dimension).
- `def O : Set (Units (Matrix n n ℝ)) := {A | A.val.transpose * A.val = 1}`: Defines O(n) as the set of invertible matrices (Units of the matrix algebra) whose underlying matrix A satisfies Aᵀ A = I. This is a legitimate encoding of the orthogonal group as a subset of GL_n(ℝ).
- `def SO : Set (Units (Matrix n n ℝ)) := {A | A.val.transpose * A.val = 1 ∧ Matrix.det A.val = 1}`: Defines SO(n) as those invertible matrices that are orthogonal and have determinant 1, i.e., {A ∈ O(n) | det A = 1}. This matches the intended set.
- `noncomputable def SO_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n ℝ)) := by sorry`: Claims the existence of a subgroup of the units, but provides no construction or connection to the previously defined set `SO`. The `sorry` means the definition is a placeholder. Crucially, this does not assert that the subgroup’s carrier equals `SO`, nor that `SO` is closed under multiplication and inversion.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: “Prove that SO(n) = {A ∈ O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group.” In standard terms, this means show that this set forms a subgroup of GL_n(ℝ) (i.e., closed under multiplication and inversion). The code correctly defines the set `SO` within the ambient group `Units (Matrix ...)`, which is a suitable model of GL_n(ℝ). However, the code does not actually state or prove that `SO` is a subgroup. The definition `SO_subgroup` is an arbitrary subgroup (due to `sorry`) with no link to `SO`. Thus, the crucial statement “SO is a subgroup” is missing.

Final check:
- The formalization does not complete (or even state) the key property required by the natural language statement: that the set `SO` is a subgroup. The placeholder `SO_subgroup` is vacuous and unrelated to `SO`. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the statement. The generalization from `Nat` to an arbitrary finite type `n` is acceptable, but the missing link between `SO` and a subgroup structure is a decisive mismatch.

Grade rationale:
- There are no fake definitions for `O` and `SO`; they are legitimate. However, the subgroup claim is given as a vacuous placeholder and, more importantly, is not tied to `SO`. Per the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” so a score around 6 is appropriate.

  - one_mem: the identity matrix (as a unit) lies in the set.
  - mul_mem: the set is closed under multiplication.
  - inv_mem: the set is closed under taking inverses.
  This is essentially a subgroup-like structure of GL_n(R), represented as a subset of Units of the matrix monoid with closure properties.
- def matrix_group_inter {R} {n} [Semiring R] (G H : MatrixGroup R n) : MatrixGroup R n := by sorry: This intends to construct the intersection of two matrix groups G and H as a new MatrixGroup R n, i.e., the set of elements that are in both G and H, and to prove it satisfies the required axioms (contains 1, closed under multiplication and inverse). However, the proof is omitted using `sorry`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: Let G, H ⊂ GL(n) be matrix groups (each consisting of n×n matrices). Prove that G ∩ H is a matrix group.
- The structure MatrixGroup indeed models a ""matrix group"" as a subgroup of GL_n(R) (here GL is represented as Units of the matrix monoid), including closure under identity, multiplication, and inverse. This matches the intended concept.
- The declared def `matrix_group_inter` corresponds to forming the intersection of two such matrix groups and showing it is again a matrix group, which is exactly the claim.
- However, the definition is left as `by sorry`, i.e., the construction/proof is omitted. Per the auditing guidelines, any use of `sorry` makes the auxiliary definition vacuous/incomplete.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Conceptually, yes: the code is aimed at proving the same statement, possibly in a slightly more general algebraic context (Semiring R instead of a ring or field), which is acceptable as a benign generalization.
- But the implementation is not provided: the intersection construction is not carried out; the def relies on `sorry`. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous/filled with `sorry`.

Differences/Issues:
- Critical: The core claim is left as a placeholder (`sorry`). Thus the code does not actually establish the result.
- Minor: Uses Units(Matrix ...) rather than Mathlib's GeneralLinearGroup; this is a reasonable and faithful representation.
- Minor generalization: Works over a Semiring, which still makes sense for matrix multiplication and units; acceptable.

Conclusion: While the shape of the formalization matches the statement, the use of `sorry` makes the translation fail under the given guidelines.

The natural language statement says: The group SO(2) of all proper orthogonal 2×2 matrices is exactly the set of rotation matrices Rθ. The Lean code defines SO2 as the set of proper orthogonal matrices (A Aᵀ = I and det A = 1) and asserts SO2 = {R θ | θ ∈ ℝ} (the range of R). This matches the intended statement precisely as a set equality. Although it doesn't explicitly declare a group structure, the statement being translated is about equality of the underlying sets, so this is faithful.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Definition of rotation matrices matches the standard form.
- Definition of SO(2) as {A | A Aᵀ = I ∧ det A = 1} is standard and equivalent to the usual definition of the special orthogonal group in 2D.
- Equality SO2 = Set.range R exactly captures ""SO(2) is exactly the set of rotation matrices."" Duplications due to periodicity of θ are irrelevant for set equality.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no misuse of Mathlib terms; no auxiliary fake constructs.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The theorem states: For a type R equipped with an Add and a Mul operation (i.e., binary operations + and * fixed by the typeclass parameters [Add R] and [Mul R]), the following are equivalent:
  Left side: Nonempty (Ring R), i.e., there exists some ring structure on R (with its own +, *, 0, 1 inside that structure).
  Right side: (i) there exists some additive commutative group structure on R (Nonempty (AddCommGroup R)), (ii) there exists some monoid structure on R (Nonempty (Monoid R)), and (iii) both distributive laws hold for the ambient + and * coming from the given [Add R] and [Mul R].
- Note: The two Nonempty statements on the right (for AddCommGroup and Monoid) do not assert that these structures use the ambient + and * provided by [Add R] and [Mul R]. Likewise, Nonempty (Ring R) on the left does not assert it uses the ambient + and * either. The distributive equalities, however, are written using the ambient [Add R] and [Mul R].

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement says: Given a set R with specified binary operations + and ·, R is a ring if and only if (R, +) is an abelian group with identity 0, (R, ·) is a monoid with identity 1, and distributivity holds. This means all properties refer to the same, fixed + and ·.
- In the Lean statement, the existence of a Ring structure (left) and of AddCommGroup/Monoid structures (right) are purely existential and need not coincide with the already fixed operations [Add R] and [Mul R]. The distributivity clauses, however, are imposed on the ambient + and *. There is no requirement that the operations in the existential structures agree with the ambient ones. Thus, the equivalence stated is not about “the given + and · make R a ring” but rather “there exists some ring structure on R” iff “there exist some additive group and monoid structures (possibly unrelated to the given +, *) and the given +, * happen to satisfy distributivity.” This is a significant mismatch.
- Moreover, the natural statement implicitly includes identities 0 and 1 associated with the given operations; in Lean, these identities live inside the existential structures and are not tied to any ambient [Zero R] or [One R] (which are not even assumed). So the identity elements are not linked to the operations appearing in the distributive laws.

Step 3: Final check.
- The two problems are different: the Lean theorem mixes existential structures with distributivity constraints on potentially different, fixed operations, whereas the natural statement asserts an equivalence for one and the same pair of operations. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

How to fix (sketch): Either (a) work entirely with the ambient operations by assuming [Zero R] [One R] [Add R] [Mul R] and state (Ring R) ↔ ([AddCommGroup R] ∧ [Monoid R] ∧ distributivity), avoiding Nonempty so that the instances are the same; or (b) avoid fixing [Add R] [Mul R] at the top, and quantify over a ring structure and show its fields are precisely an AddCommGroup, a Monoid, and distributivity, all from the same structure.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Comment states the two classical facts: infinite cyclic groups ≃ ℤ additively, finite cyclic groups ≃ ℤ/nℤ additively.
- `open Multiplicative`: Opens the `Multiplicative` namespace/type synonym.

First theorem:
- `theorem infinite_cyclic_add_group_iso_Int {G : Type*} [Add G] [Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ] (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative G)) (hn : ¬ Nonempty (Fintype G)) : Nonempty (AddEquiv G Int) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G equipped with an addition (but not necessarily any additive monoid/group axioms) and with an integer power operation on `Multiplicative G`, if `Multiplicative G` is cyclic and there is no fintype structure on G (so, informally, G is infinite), then there exists an additive isomorphism (AddEquiv) from G to ℤ.

Second theorem:
- `theorem finite_cyclic_add_group_iso_zmod {G : Type*} [Add G] [Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ] [Fintype G] (h : IsCyclic (Multiplicative G)) : ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ Nonempty (AddEquiv G (ZMod n)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type G with addition (again, not explicitly a group) and integer power on `Multiplicative G`, if G is finite and `Multiplicative G` is cyclic, then there exists a positive integer n and an additive isomorphism from G to ZMod n.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- Intended statement: “Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ. Any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ_n for some positive n.” This is about groups (with the group axioms), and the isomorphism is a group isomorphism (in additive notation: AddEquiv for additive groups).
- Code issues:
  - The hypotheses on G are only `[Add G]` (mere addition) rather than `[AddGroup G]` (additive group). This weakens the assumptions substantially and does not reflect that G is a group. An AddEquiv only needs an addition, so the statement as written claims more generality than the natural language (it purports to hold under strictly weaker structure than a group), which is not faithful.
  - The cyclicity hypothesis is `IsCyclic (Multiplicative G)`. Using the `Multiplicative` synonym can be a correct way to express that an additive structure is cyclic (since `IsCyclic` is typically stated in multiplicative form), but this normally requires corresponding instances (e.g., `[AddMonoid G]` for monoid-level `^ ℕ`, or `[AddGroup G]` for `zpow`). The code instead assumes `[Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ]` directly, which is an unusual and likely unnecessary requirement and still does not assert the group axioms. While this might let the code typecheck, it departs from the standard “group” context of the natural language statement.
  - The notion of “infinite” is encoded as `¬ Nonempty (Fintype G)` rather than `Infinite G`. This is a minor technical mismatch but largely acceptable when formalizing such statements.
  - Targets `AddEquiv G Int` and `AddEquiv G (ZMod n)` do match the idea of isomorphism of additive groups, provided G is indeed an additive group. But since the code never requires `[AddGroup G]`, it is not ensured that these are group isomorphisms rather than merely isomorphisms of types with a binary addition.

3) Final comparison:
- Similarities: Both theorems encode the core classification claims: infinite cyclic corresponds to ℤ, finite cyclic corresponds to ZMod n with n > 0, and they use AddEquiv appropriately for additive-group-style isomorphisms.
- Differences/mismatches:
  - Missing group axioms: The code assumes only `[Add G]` rather than `[AddGroup G]`. This is a significant deviation from “cyclic group.”
  - Nonstandard and arguably extraneous `[Pow (Multiplicative G) ℤ]` assumption. Properly one would require the relevant group/monoid structure so that the cyclicity predicate is meaningful.
  - The notion of infinite via `¬ Nonempty (Fintype G)` is acceptable but not the most idiomatic.

Conclusion: While the broad intent matches, the formal statements are not fully faithful to the natural language because they do not require G to be a group. Hence, not faithful.

- Comment explains the goal: multiplicativity of the sign in S_n.
- `theorem sgn_mul_in_Sn {n : Nat} (hn : 1 ≤ n) : let S_n := Equiv.Perm (Fin n) ∀ α β : S_n, Equiv.Perm.sign (α * β) = Equiv.Perm.sign α * Equiv.Perm.sign β := by sorry`
  Natural language: For a natural number n with n ≥ 1, let S_n denote the group of permutations of Fin n (i.e., the symmetric group on n letters). Then for all α, β ∈ S_n, the sign of the product α * β equals the product of the signs of α and β.
  Here, `S_n := Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is the symmetric group on n letters, and `Equiv.Perm.sign` is the sign homomorphism. Multiplication `*` is the group operation (composition) on permutations.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original says: Let n ≥ 1 and S_n be the symmetric group on {1, …, n}. For any α, β ∈ S_n, sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β).
- The Lean code states exactly the same property: assumes n ≥ 1 via `(hn : 1 ≤ n)`, defines S_n as permutations of Fin n (which is canonically the same as {1,…,n} up to relabeling), and asserts multiplicativity of `sign` for all α, β in S_n.
- The use of Fin n instead of {1,…,n} is a standard formalization choice and is mathematically equivalent.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Indexing difference ({1,…,n} vs Fin n = {0,…,n−1}) is an inessential isomorphism; no change in meaning.
- The hypothesis n ≥ 1 appears in both the natural statement and the Lean statement; in Lean it's present but not used, which is fine and does not alter the claim.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a let-binding for S_n, which is legitimate.
- Therefore the code is a faithful translation of the statement.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement matches the natural language statement in mathematical meaning.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable (F : Type _) [Field F]`: Let F be a type equipped with a field structure, i.e., F is a field.
- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Define E(t) to be the 2×2 matrix over F with entries given by a case split on indices i, j ∈ Fin 2:
  - If i = 0 and j = 0, the entry is 1.
  - If i = 0 and j = 1, the entry is t.
  - If i = 1 and j = 0, the entry is 0.
  - Otherwise (i = 1 and j = 1), the entry is 1.
  This is exactly the matrix [[1, t], [0, 1]].
- `def G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F) := range (E F)`: Define G as the image of F under E, i.e., G = {E(t) | t ∈ F}.
- `theorem G_is_matrix_group : ... := by sorry`: States that G contains the identity matrix, is closed under multiplication, and every element has an inverse in G, with explicit two-sided inverse equalities A * B = 1 and B * A = 1.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: Let F be a field and define G = {E(t) : t ∈ F} with E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]]. Prove that G is a matrix group under multiplication.
- The Lean code defines exactly the same E(t) and G, and states precisely the group properties under matrix multiplication (identity in G, closure under multiplication, and existence of two-sided inverses within G). Associativity is inherited from matrix multiplication and need not be restated.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; E and G are genuine definitions. The theorem is a clear formalization of “G is a matrix group under multiplication.”
- Minor technical note: The use of Fin 2 and explicit index checks correctly encodes the specified 2×2 matrix. The set G is defined via range, which matches {E(t) | t ∈ F}.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. There are no discrepancies in meaning or scope. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task, since we evaluate the statement, not the proof.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem elementary_row_add_matrix_mem_SL (n : Nat) (i j : Fin n) (t : ℝ) (h : i ≠ j) : ... = 1` states: For a natural number n, indices i, j in Fin n with i ≠ j, and a real number t, the determinant of the matrix `(1 : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) + Matrix.of (fun a b => if a = i ∧ b = j then t else 0)` equals 1. Here `(1 : Matrix ...)` is the identity matrix, and `Matrix.of (fun a b => if a = i ∧ b = j then t else 0)` is the matrix with t in position (i, j) and 0 elsewhere. Thus the matrix in question is I plus the matrix with a single nonzero entry t at (i, j), i.e., the standard elementary matrix that performs the row operation “add t times row j to row i” when left-multiplying. The hypothesis `h : i ≠ j` ensures it’s the row-addition type (off-diagonal) rather than a diagonal scaling.
- The conclusion `det(...) = 1` asserts that this elementary matrix has determinant 1.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines E_{ij}(t) as the elementary matrix obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i, for 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n and t ∈ ℝ, and asks to prove E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n).
- The Lean code constructs exactly that matrix as I plus t at entry (i, j) and asserts its determinant is 1. Since SL(n, ℝ) is the set of n×n real matrices of determinant 1, showing `det = 1` is precisely the condition needed for membership. The use of `Fin n` in Lean corresponds to indexing rows/columns by an n-element type (0..n−1 instead of 1..n), which is a standard formalization difference and does not change the content. The hypothesis `i ≠ j` matches the condition in the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code proves `det = 1` rather than explicitly packaging the matrix as an element of `SL(n, ℝ)` (the SpecialLinearGroup subtype). This is a minor presentational difference: mathematically, `det = 1` is equivalent to membership in SL(n, ℝ). There are no vacuous or fake definitions; the matrix constructed is precisely the intended elementary matrix.
- Indexing is via `Fin n` rather than {1, ..., n}, which is a harmless technical difference.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an essentially faithful translation of the natural language claim. The only minor difference is that it states `det = 1` rather than explicitly “∈ SL(n, ℝ)”, but these are equivalent in meaning.

- The Lean hypotheses express precisely that A and B are in O(2) (AᵀA = I and BᵀB = I) and are reflections (determinant −1). The conclusion expresses that A*B is in SO(2) (orthogonal and determinant 1). This matches exactly.
- The use of 2×2 real matrices matches O(2) over ℝ. The conclusion is exactly the defining properties of SO(2).

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- While the code does not use Mathlib’s `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` type, it faithfully states the properties defining membership. This is acceptable per the guidelines.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R] {n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We work over a commutative ring R, and matrices indexed by a finite type n with decidable equality.
- `def is_diagonal (A : Matrix n n R) : Prop := ∀ i j, i ≠ j → A i j = 0`: A matrix A is diagonal if all off-diagonal entries are zero. This is a standard, faithful definition.
- `def D1 : Set (Matrix n n R) := { A | is_diagonal A ∧ Matrix.det A = 1 }`: D1 is the set of matrices that are diagonal and have determinant 1. This matches “the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n,R)” (since SL means det=1).
- `def D1_is_subgroup_of_units : Subgroup (Matrix n n R)ˣ := by sorry`: This purports to define a specific subgroup of the unit group of matrices (i.e., GL(n,R)) but the entire definition is replaced by `sorry`. Moreover, it does not connect the subgroup to D1 at all (e.g., by specifying its carrier as the set of units whose underlying matrices lie in D1). As written, it is a vacuous placeholder.

Step 2: Does the whole Lean snippet faithfully express the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: “Let D1(n) be the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n). Show that D1(n) is a matrix group.” This means: define D1(n) as those matrices with det=1 and diagonal, and prove they form a subgroup of GL(n) (or of SL(n)).
- The code correctly defines D1 as a subset of matrices with det=1 and diagonal. However, the crucial part—exhibiting D1 as a matrix group—is not actually provided. Instead, a completely unspecified subgroup of units is postulated with `sorry`, and, critically, it is not even stated that this subgroup corresponds to D1. Thus, the key claim is not formalized, and the object `D1_is_subgroup_of_units` is not tied to D1.

Step 3: Final comparison and discrepancies.
- Faithful parts: definition of diagonal; definition of D1 as diagonal with det=1 (a faithful formalization of “diagonal matrices in SL(n)” over a general commutative ring).
- Problems:
  - The claim that D1 forms a matrix group is not proved or even stated precisely. The provided `Subgroup (Matrix n n R)ˣ` is created via `sorry` and is not related to D1 in its carrier or axioms.
  - The use of `sorry` makes the key construction vacuous, violating the guideline against vacuous placeholders.
  - Even if `sorry` were filled with something, the current type of `D1_is_subgroup_of_units` does not ensure any relation to D1; one would need to define a subgroup whose carrier is `{ u : (Matrix n n R)ˣ | is_diagonal u.val ∧ det u.val = 1 }` and prove closure. As written, that link is missing.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation of the statement “D1(n) is a matrix group” because the central group structure is neither constructed nor connected to D1, and a vacuous `sorry` is used. The setup for D1 itself is fine, but the main assertion fails to be formalized.

Line-by-line translation:

- The theorem statement: `∃ (f : G →* G × H), (∀ x, f x = (x, (1 : H))) ∧ Function.Injective (f : G → G × H)` asserts that there exists a monoid (hence group) homomorphism f from G to the product group G × H such that for every x in G, f(x) = (x, 1_H), and moreover f is injective as a function.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: “Show that the map φ: G → G × H given by φ(x) = (x,1) is an injective homomorphism.”
- The Lean statement asserts existence of a homomorphism f that is pointwise equal to x ↦ (x, 1), and that this f is injective. This is exactly the same content: it identifies the specific map and states it is a homomorphism and injective.
- Using `G →* G × H` is the standard Mathlib type for a (multiplicative) monoid homomorphism, which in the presence of `[Group]` coincides with a group homomorphism. The codomain `G × H` carries the product group structure, matching the intended context.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem is a direct formalization of the statement. The use of existence rather than naming `φ` explicitly is a standard and equivalent way to express that this particular function is a homomorphism.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem and the natural language statement are the same mathematically. No discrepancies in domains, codomains, or properties (homomorphism and injectivity) are present.

The mathematical content is the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is a direct formalization of the injectivity–kernel-triviality criterion. Slight differences in phrasing (not explicitly naming K) are purely cosmetic and do not change meaning.

- The natural statement: For n ≥ 1, in S_n on {1, ..., n}, every factorization of the identity as a product of transpositions uses an even number of transpositions.
- Lean’s `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is the standard representation of S_n. The difference between {1, ..., n} and `Fin n` (which is {0, ..., n−1}) is a harmless indexing convention.
- The condition that each list element is a transposition is correctly captured by `∃ x y : Fin n, x ≠ y ∧ τ = Equiv.swap x y`.
- The product equaling the identity is exactly `l.prod = 1`.
- The conclusion `Even l.length` matches “uses an even number of transpositions”.
- The hypothesis `1 ≤ n` matches the natural-language assumption n ≥ 1.
- Allowing the empty list is consistent with the statement (an empty factorization uses 0 transpositions, which is even), and the natural-language claim is universal over all factorizations, so this is appropriate.

3) Final check: The two problems match. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; all concepts (permutations, transpositions, product, evenness) are standard Mathlib notions. The only minor difference is the indexing set {1, ..., n} vs `Fin n`, which is standard and does not change the meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural-language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library of definitions and theorems.
- `open Equiv`: Open the `Equiv` namespace (for permutations and related structures).
- The theorem:
  `theorem s5_not_solvable (h : IsSimpleGroup (alternatingGroup (Fin 5))) : ¬ IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)) := by sorry`
  translates to: Assuming `h`, namely that the alternating group on 5 letters `A5` (encoded as `alternatingGroup (Fin 5)`) is a simple group, conclude that the symmetric group on 5 letters `S5` (encoded as `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)`) is not solvable (`¬ IsSolvable ...`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is clear and uses standard Mathlib predicates: `IsSimpleGroup` and `IsSolvable`.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is: ""Assuming that A5 is a simple group, show that S5 is not a solvable group."" The Lean statement exactly assumes simplicity of `A5` and concludes non-solvability of `S5`. The identification of `A5` with `alternatingGroup (Fin 5)` and `S5` with `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` is standard in Mathlib. No extra or missing hypotheses.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions, and the theorem statement precisely matches the mathematical content. The presence of `sorry` is only in the proof (allowed for this auditing task) and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement.

end noncomputable section
",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the mathematical library.
- `noncomputable section` opens a section where noncomputable definitions are allowed.
- `def H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix depending on θ. Concretely, H θ = [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), -cos(2θ)]]. The docstring states this is the matrix of reflection across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis. This is the standard formula for the reflection matrix across that line: R(−θ) diag(1, −1) R(θ) = [[cos 2θ, sin 2θ], [sin 2θ, −cos 2θ]].
- The theorem `reflection_is_improper_orthogonal (θ : ℝ)` states that for each real θ, `transpose (H θ) * H θ = I` and `det (H θ) = -1`. This expresses that H θ is orthogonal and has determinant −1 (i.e., is an improper orthogonal matrix). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim: For each θ, the reflection across the specified line is a linear operator, and its matrix H_θ is an improper orthogonal matrix: H_θ ∈ O(2) and det H_θ = −1.
- The code defines the matrix H θ explicitly with the standard reflection formula, and asserts the two properties characterizing an improper orthogonal matrix: H^T H = I (orthogonality) and det(H) = −1.
- The statement ""is a linear operator"" is not explicitly asserted, but since H θ is a matrix, it canonically defines a linear map ℝ² → ℝ². The code does not construct a `LinearMap` or prove linearity, but the matrix representation suffices to capture the intended linear operator in this context.
- The code does not explicitly use the set-theoretic definition of O(2), but `HᵀH = I` is equivalent to being orthogonal. Including det = −1 matches the ""improper"" part.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes in essence: the matrix defined matches the reflection across the given line; and the theorem asserts the orthogonality and determinant condition. The only mild omission is not explicitly stating “the reflection is linear,” but representing it by a matrix intrinsically encodes linearity. Also, membership in O(2) is expressed via the defining equation rather than a type-level membership, which is equivalent. No vacuous placeholders are present; the auxiliary definition H is substantive.

Minor note: The code ends with `end noncomputable section`; in Lean this is usually just `end`, but the prompt assumes the code compiles, so we do not penalize this.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful with a very slight presentational difference regarding the explicit statement of linearity and set membership in O(2).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `alpha : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 1` defines alpha as the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in S_3 on the set {0,1,2}. In 1-based notation this is (1 2), matching the statement's α = (1,2).
- `beta : Equiv.Perm (Fin 3) := (Equiv.swap (0 : Fin 3) 1).trans (Equiv.swap (1 : Fin 3) 2)` defines beta as the composition that applies the swap (0 1) first and then (1 2). In Equiv, `e1.trans e2` means do e1 then e2. Computing this composition gives the 3-cycle (0 2 1), i.e., (1 3 2) in 1-based notation, which is the inverse of (1 2 3).
- `G := Subgroup.closure ({alpha, beta} : Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))` defines G as the subgroup generated by alpha and beta in the full symmetric group on Fin 3.
- The statement `G = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)))` asserts that G equals the whole S_3.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language sets α = (1,2) and β = (1,2,3). The code has α = (1,2), which matches. For β, the code defines the inverse 3-cycle (1,3,2) rather than (1,2,3). This is a slight discrepancy in the specific generator chosen, but it does not change the group generated together with α; both pairs generate S_3.
- The target claim “G = S_3” is exactly represented by `G = ⊤` in the group of permutations on Fin 3.
- The shift from {1,2,3} to Fin 3 = {0,1,2} is a standard formalization detail and does not affect meaning.

3) Final check:
- The only difference is that β is taken to be (1,3,2) rather than (1,2,3). Since both are 3-cycles and, with α = (1,2), generate S_3, the mathematical content (that the subgroup generated is S_3) is unchanged. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all constructions use standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful with a minor notational/orientation discrepancy for β that does not affect the result.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def SO2 : Type := {A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // A.transpose * A = 1 ∧ A.det = 1}`
  This defines the type underlying the special orthogonal group in dimension 2 as the subtype of 2×2 real matrices satisfying AᵀA = I and det A = 1. This is the usual set of SO(2) matrices (though no group structure is attached here).

- `noncomputable def rot_matrix (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...`
  This defines the 2×2 rotation matrix corresponding to an angle θ, with entries [ [cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ] ]. This matches the standard rotation matrices.

- `def rotations_set : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := Set.range rot_matrix`
  This defines the set of all rotation matrices as the image of `rot_matrix` over θ ∈ ℝ. This encodes the set {ρ_θ} of rotations (as matrices), identifying angles modulo 2π implicitly by set equality.

- `noncomputable def SO2_equiv_rotations : SO2 ≃ {A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // A ∈ rotations_set} := by sorry`
  This states there is a type equivalence (bijection) between the subtype `SO2` and the subtype consisting of matrices in `rotations_set`. The body is `sorry` (i.e., omitted). Importantly, this is a bare equivalence of types `≃`, not a group isomorphism `≃*`, and no group structures are declared on either side in this code.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is that the matrix group SO(2) is isomorphic (as a group, under matrix multiplication/composition) to the group of all rotations of ℝ², {ρ_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}.
- The code only asserts a type equivalence between the underlying sets (subtypes) of SO(2) and the set of rotation matrices. It does not:
  1) endow either side with a group structure in the statement,
  2) assert or encode that the equivalence is a group homomorphism,
  3) use a group isomorphism type like `≃*` or describe composition/multiplication.
- Thus, the code proves (if completed) at most a bijection of sets, not a group isomorphism, which is strictly weaker than the intended statement.

Other considerations:
- The auxiliary definitions (`SO2`, `rot_matrix`, `rotations_set`) are legitimate, not vacuous.
- The final equivalence is left as `sorry`; while proofs are not required here, the conceptual mismatch (type equivalence vs group isomorphism) remains the key fidelity issue.
- Using matrices to represent rotations is fine, and `Set.range rot_matrix` captures the set {ρ_θ}. However, the statement should be a group isomorphism, ideally `SO(2) ≃* {A | A ∈ rotations_set}` with the inherited group structures, or better, using Mathlib's `SpecialOrthogonalGroup (Fin 2) ℝ` and showing it is isomorphic to the subgroup `range rot_matrix` with group structure.

Final check: The mathematical statements are different. The Lean code encodes a bijection of sets, whereas the natural language asserts a group isomorphism. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Comment explains the goal: if m, n are coprime then C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n, with C_k represented by `ZMod k` as the cyclic additive group of order k.
- `def zmod_mul_equiv_zmod_prod_zmod {m n : ℕ} (h : Nat.Coprime m n) : AddEquiv (ZMod (m * n)) (ZMod m × ZMod n) := by sorry`:
  This declares (and, via `sorry`, postulates) an additive group isomorphism between `ZMod (m * n)` and the product `ZMod m × ZMod n` under the hypothesis that `m` and `n` are coprime. `AddEquiv` is the type of additive group isomorphisms. `ZMod k` is the integers modulo k, which as an additive group is cyclic of order k (for k > 0).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asserts: if m and n are relatively prime, then the cyclic group of order mn is isomorphic to the product of the cyclic groups of orders m and n. Interpreting `C_k` as `ZMod k` with its additive group, the code’s statement is exactly the additive Chinese remainder theorem in this context: `ZMod (m*n) ≃+ ZMod m × ZMod n` under `Nat.Coprime m n`.
- Using `AddEquiv` matches the group isomorphism notion. Representing `C_n` by `ZMod n` is standard.
- The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for this auditing task since we are checking the statement/translation, not the proof.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only subtlety is that the Lean statement allows `m` or `n` to be 0, but coprime forces the other to be 1 in that case, and the resulting equivalence still holds in the `ZMod` setting. The natural statement typically assumes positive integers for the notion of a group of order n, but this is at most a slight generalization and does not harm faithfulness.
- Aside from that minor edge case, the Lean statement precisely captures the intended theorem.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work with permutations `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, i.e., the symmetric group on the finite set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.
- The theorem statement: For `n : ℕ` with `hn : 2 ≤ n`, we assert that the subgroup generated by two specific permutations equals the whole symmetric group (the top subgroup `⊤`). Formally: `Subgroup.closure {…} = ⊤`.
- The two generators are:
  1) `Equiv.swap (Fin.mk 0 ...) (Fin.mk 1 ...)`: the transposition swapping `0` and `1` in `Fin n` (with the proofs `0 < n` and `1 < n` derived from `2 ≤ n`). This corresponds to the transposition `(0 1)`.
  2) `Equiv.ofBijective (fun i : Fin n => ⟨(i.val + 1) % n, ...⟩) (by sorry)`: the permutation sending `i` to `i + 1 (mod n)` on `Fin n`, i.e., the n-cycle `(0 1 2 ... n-1)`. The `by sorry` is a placeholder proof that this function is bijective; it does not alter the intended object.
- The equality `Subgroup.closure (…two elements…) = ⊤` reads: the subgroup generated by these two permutations is the entire symmetric group on `n` letters.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For `n ≥ 2`, `S_n` is generated by the two elements `{(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}`.
- Lean code: For `n ≥ 2`, the symmetric group on `n` letters (as permutations of `Fin n` = `{0,...,n-1}`) is generated by the transposition `(0 1)` and the n-cycle `(0 1 ... n-1)` given by `i ↦ i+1 mod n`.
- These differ only by indexing convention (Lean uses `0..n-1` while the natural language uses `1..n`). This is a standard relabeling and does not change the mathematical content. The subgroup-closure equality exactly expresses “generated by these two elements”.

Checks per guidelines:
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions; everything used is standard Mathlib (`Equiv.swap`, `Equiv.ofBijective`, `Subgroup.closure`, `Equiv.Perm`, `Fin n`).
- The `sorry`s are only for proofs (bijectivity of the shift and the main theorem) and not for definitions; they do not compromise the statement’s faithfulness.
- No unintended specialization/generalization: the hypothesis `2 ≤ n` matches `n ≥ 2`. The objects correspond exactly to `(1,2)` and `(1,2,...,n)` up to indexing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `let θ := 2 * π / (n : ℝ)` sets θ = 2π/n in radians.
- `let r : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 rotation matrix r = [[cos θ, -sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]]. The piecewise-on-indices definition is exactly that standard rotation matrix.

- `r * h * r = h` states the desired matrix identity, i.e., r h r = h, with matrix multiplication.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement asks to represent r by the rotation matrix for angle 2π/n and h by a suitable reflection matrix (across the horizontal axis), and prove the identity r h r = h. The Lean code does exactly this: it defines those matrices and asserts the equality r * h * r = h.
- The code does not explicitly mention D_n, but the matrices define the standard linear representation of D_n; the statement being proved is precisely the matrix identity requested.
- The hypothesis n ≥ 3 is included but not used; this is a harmless extra assumption and does not change the mathematical content of the equality.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same: Both the natural language and the code specify r as rotation by 2π/n and h as reflection across the horizontal axis in R^2, and assert r h r = h. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all auxiliary definitions are standard matrices. The only minor difference is the unused hypothesis n ≥ 3, which does not affect the statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {k : Type u} [Field k]`: Fix an arbitrary field k.
- `variable (Gal : Polynomial k → Type v)` together with `[∀ p, Group (Gal p)]`: Postulate an assignment that to each polynomial p over k associates a type Gal p equipped with a group structure. No connection to the actual Galois group is enforced.
- `variable (expressible_by_radicals : ∀ p : Polynomial k, Prop)`: Postulate an arbitrary predicate on polynomials, intended to mean “the roots of p are expressible by radicals,” but not defined.
- The theorem:
  `theorem polynomial_roots_expressible_by_radicals_iff_solvable {p : Polynomial k} (hp : Irreducible p) : IsSolvable (Gal p) ↔ expressible_by_radicals p := by sorry`
  This asserts: for any irreducible polynomial p over k, the group Gal p is solvable if and only if the predicate expressible_by_radicals holds of p. There is no definition or linkage that ensures Gal p is the Galois group or that expressible_by_radicals captures “roots are expressible in radicals.”

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Let p(x) be an irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients, and let G = Gal(p) be its Galois group. Then the complex roots of p(x) are expressible in terms of radicals if and only if G is a solvable group.
- Mismatches:
  - Base field: The original fixes coefficients in ℚ and speaks about complex roots. The code allows an arbitrary field k and does not mention ℂ or embeddings into ℂ.
  - Galois group: The code introduces an arbitrary assignment Gal along with a group structure but does not define it to be the Galois group of p (e.g., automorphism group of the splitting field). This is a placeholder, not a faithful definition.
  - Expressibility by radicals: The code postulates an arbitrary predicate `expressible_by_radicals` with no definition relating it to radicals or roots in ℂ.
  - The theorem is presented with an unproven `sorry`, but per the auditing guidelines, the issue is the vacuity/unconstrained placeholders rather than the lack of proof.

Final check:
- The mathematical content of the Lean statement is not tied to the intended objects; it asserts an equivalence between two arbitrary constructions `Gal` and `expressible_by_radicals` for irreducible p over an arbitrary field k. This is not a faithful formalization of the classical solvability-by-radicals criterion.
- Even if we overlook the generalization from ℚ to k (which could be acceptable with appropriate hypotheses), the absence of genuine definitions for the Galois group and the “expressible by radicals” predicate makes the translation non-faithful.

Grade rationale:
- This uses vacuous placeholders (as arbitrary variables) for key notions. If replaced with proper Mathlib definitions (splitting field, Galois group, radicals), the final equivalence would be on the right track, hence not completely unrelated. Therefore, a mid score is appropriate.

- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib but nothing from it is actually used.
- axiom A5_nonabelian_simple : Prop: Introduces a bare proposition symbol named “A5_nonabelian_simple.” It does not define what A5 is nor assert or prove this proposition; it’s just a placeholder Prop.
- axiom S5_is_galois_general_quintic : Prop: Another placeholder Prop, intended to represent “the Galois group of the general quintic is S5,” but with no connection to any actual Galois-theoretic construction in Mathlib.
- axiom roots_general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals : Prop: Placeholder Prop meant to mean “the roots of the general quintic are solvable by radicals.” No definition of solvability by radicals nor of the “general quintic.”

- axiom S5_solvable_implies_A5_solvable : S5_solvable → A5_solvable: Axiomatizes the standard group-theoretic implication, again as a placeholder.
- axiom A5_not_solvable : ¬ A5_solvable: Axiomatizes that A5 is not solvable.
- theorem general_quintic_not_solvable_by_radicals (hA5_simple : A5_nonabelian_simple) (hGalois : S5_is_galois_general_quintic) : ¬ roots_general_quintic_solvable_by_radicals := by sorry: States the desired conclusion under the assumptions “A5 is nonabelian simple” and “the Galois group is S5” (both placeholders), with proof omitted.

2) Does the whole translation match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is: assuming (i) A5 is simple and (ii) the Galois group of the general quintic is S5, conclude that the general quintic is not solvable by radicals.
- The Lean theorem statement mirrors the shape of this claim. However, all the underlying notions (A5, S5, general quintic, solvability by radicals, Galois group) are not defined or connected to Mathlib concepts; they are mere proposition names and axiomatized implications. There is no legitimate Mathlib formalization of the objects involved. Thus, while the syntactic shape resembles the intended result, it is not a faithful translation: it does not use Mathlib’s definitions for Galois groups, solvability, radicals, or the groups S5/A5.
- Additionally, the proof is omitted (by sorry). While the brief allows omitting proofs, the key issue is that the code replaces the mathematical content with vacuous placeholders and axioms, which violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must faithfully describe what they claim to represent.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Major discrepancy: All core mathematical notions are replaced by axioms and bare Prop constants, rather than Mathlib definitions. This makes the translation non-faithful.
- The code introduces extra axioms (e.g., A5_not_solvable, solvable_by_radicals_implies_S5_solvable, S5_solvable_implies_A5_solvable) rather than deriving them from Mathlib. They are not connected to any real structures.
- The symbols A5_nonabelian_simple and S5_is_galois_general_quintic are just proposition names and are not asserted true; instead, they are taken as assumptions in the final theorem, matching the “assuming these facts” wording, but without any content linking them to actual A5/S5.
- Therefore, despite the high-level logical shape matching the English statement, the formalization is not faithful per the auditing guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful. This fits the rubric case of using vacuous placeholders; if replaced by real Mathlib notions, the final theorem would be the intended statement, but as written it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G]`: We fix a group G.
- The theorem `unique_subgroup_of_order_normal {H : Subgroup G} [Fintype H] {n : ℕ} (h_card : Fintype.card H = n) (h_unique : ∀ K : Subgroup G, Fintype.card K = n → K = H) : ∀ g : G, Subgroup.map ((MulAut.conj g).toMulHom) H = H` states:
  Given a subgroup H of G which is finite (has a Fintype instance) and whose cardinal is n, and assuming uniqueness among all subgroups K of G with cardinal n (i.e., any subgroup K with card n must equal H), then for every g in G, the image of H under conjugation by g (represented as the subgroup map along the inner automorphism `MulAut.conj g`) equals H. Concretely, this says gHg⁻¹ = H for all g.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: If H is a subgroup of order n and is the only subgroup of order n in G, then H is normal in G (H ◁ G).
- Lean statement: It assumes H has order n, uniqueness of subgroups of order n, and concludes that H is invariant under conjugation by every g, i.e., gHg⁻¹ = H for all g. This is precisely the standard characterization of normality. Hence the conclusion implies H is normal.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Hypotheses match: H is a subgroup of order n (via `Fintype.card H = n`), and uniqueness among subgroups of order n (via `∀ K, Fintype.card K = n → K = H`).
- Conclusion matches: normality is equivalently expressed as invariance under conjugation, which the code asserts by equality of the conjugate image and H for all g.
- No vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions are introduced; everything uses Mathlib notions. The formulation via `Subgroup.map ((MulAut.conj g).toMulHom) H = H` is a standard Lean way to express gHg⁻¹ = H.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem permutation_representation_to_matrix_representation {G : Type*} [Group G] (n : Nat) {F : Type*} [Field F] (δ : G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :`
  This sets up: G is a group, n is a natural number, F is a field, and δ is a function from G to the symmetric group S_n modeled as permutations of Fin n. Note: δ is just a function, not assumed to be a group homomorphism.

- `∃ ρ : G → (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F)ˣ,`: 
  There exists a function ρ from G to the group of units (invertible elements) of n×n matrices over F, i.e., to GL_n(F) (represented as units in the matrix ring).

- `(∀ g, (ρ g : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F) = fun i j => if i = δ g j then (1 : F) else 0) ∧`:
  For every g in G, the underlying matrix of ρ(g) has entries equal to 1 exactly when i = δ(g)(j), and 0 otherwise; i.e., ρ(g) is the permutation matrix associated to the permutation δ(g) using the convention P_{i,j} = 1 iff i = δ(g)(j).

- `∀ g h, ρ (g * h) = ρ g * ρ h`:
  ρ is multiplicative, i.e., a semigroup/group homomorphism into GL_n(F). Since the codomain is a group, this also implies ρ(1) = 1 automatically.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language requires δ to be a permutation representation, i.e., a group homomorphism δ : G → S_n.
- The Lean statement only assumes δ is a function from G to S_n (Perm (Fin n)), not a homomorphism. Despite that, it concludes the existence of a multiplicative map ρ into GL_n(F) matching the permutation matrices of δ(g). This is too strong: unless δ is a homomorphism, the induced map ρ will generally fail to be multiplicative. So the Lean theorem asserts more than is justified by its hypotheses and deviates from the intended statement.
- Otherwise, the target type for GL_n(F) as units of matrices is fine, and the explicit form of the permutation matrix is consistent with standard conventions.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Difference: The original assumes δ is a group homomorphism (a permutation representation). The Lean code does not assume this and yet claims the existence of a group homomorphism ρ with the specified matrices. This is a substantive mismatch; the statement in Lean is not faithful to the original unless δ is assumed to be a homomorphism (e.g., δ : G →* Perm (Fin n) or by adding the hypothesis ∀ g h, δ (g*h) = δ g * δ h).

Conclusion: Not faithful due to missing homomorphism assumption on δ. Everything else aligns well with the intended construction.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def IsFiniteSimpleGroup (G : Type u) : Prop := True`
  This defines the statement “G is a finite simple group” to be always true for any type G. It does not require G to have a group structure, be finite, or be simple. This is a vacuous placeholder.

- `inductive SimpleGroupClass ...`
  This defines a data type listing coarse classes meant to correspond to the classification: 
  • `cyclic_prime (p : Nat)` – intended to represent cyclic groups of prime order, but no primality is required here.
  • `alternating (n : Nat) (hn : n >= 5)` – intended to represent alternating groups A_n with n ≥ 5.
  • `classical_lie` – a single bucket for all classical finite simple groups of Lie type (PSL, PSU, PSp, orthogonal, etc.), with no parameters.
  • `exceptional_or_twisted_lie` – a single bucket for all exceptional and twisted groups of Lie type (including Tits), again with no parameters.
  • `sporadic (i : Fin 26)` – intended to index the 26 sporadic groups.
  This is a very high-level tagging of the classes, not the actual groups.

- `def is_isomorphic_to_class (G : Type u) (c : SimpleGroupClass) : Prop := True`
  This asserts “G is isomorphic to some representative of class c” but defines it to be always true, so it carries no mathematical content.

- `theorem classification_of_finite_simple_groups (G : Type u) (h : IsFiniteSimpleGroup G) : ∃ c : SimpleGroupClass, is_isomorphic_to_class G c := by sorry`
  The theorem claims: if G is a finite simple group (but that predicate is True), then there exists some class c such that G is isomorphic to that class (also True). With the placeholders, the statement is vacuous and trivially true for any type G. It also uses `sorry` for the proof, which is acceptable in this task context but indicates no actual proof content.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is the classification of finite simple groups into the concrete families: cyclic of prime order, alternating A_n for n ≥ 5, finite simple groups of Lie type (classical and exceptional/twisted, including Tits), and the 26 sporadic groups. To formalize this faithfully, the code needs:
- A genuine notion that G is a finite simple group, requiring a group structure on G and finiteness.
- A precise notion that G is isomorphic (as an abstract finite group) to a member of one of those families, with appropriate parameters (e.g., n and q for PSL_n(q), etc.), or at least a definition of “isomorphic to some group in this class”.
However, the code uses vacuous placeholders (`True`) for both key predicates and lacks any group structure on G. Consequently, the theorem as stated is logically vacuous and does not capture the classification.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The code does not require G to be a group (no `[Group G]`, no `[Fintype G]`), unlike the statement which concerns finite simple groups.
- `IsFiniteSimpleGroup` is defined as `True`, so every type qualifies; this is a severe mismatch.
- `is_isomorphic_to_class` is `True`, so the conclusion “∃ c, is_isomorphic_to_class G c” is always true regardless of G; again, vacuous.
- The classification buckets are extremely coarse. While high-level buckets for classical/exceptional/twisted are acceptable as a modeling choice, the lack of parameters and the vacuous isomorphism predicate mean the code does not actually assert that G belongs to any of those families in a meaningful sense.
- There is a `sorry` in the theorem proof, but per the task this is acceptable; the main issue is the vacuous definitions that render the statement unfaithful.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It relies on vacuous placeholders and omits essential structure. If the placeholders were replaced with legitimate Mathlib concepts and the group structure/finiteness were properly included, the overall shape (existence of a class among the enumerated families) could be made faithful at a high level; however, as written, it fails.

- The natural language statement defines G as the set of 4×4 block upper triangular matrices [[A,B],[0,C]] with A,B,C ∈ Mat_{2×2}(F) and det(AC) ≠ 0, and asks to verify G is a matrix group under multiplication (i.e., a subgroup of GL_4(F)).
- The Lean code models 4×4 matrices via I = Fin 2 ⊕ Fin 2 and uses Matrix.fromBlocks to construct the block matrix. The condition det(A*C) ≠ 0 matches the given det(AC) ≠ 0.
- The theorem asserts the existence of a Subgroup of GL(I,F) whose elements are precisely those invertible matrices with that block form and det(A*C) ≠ 0. This is exactly the formalization of “G is a matrix group (subgroup of GL) under multiplication.”
- No vacuous placeholders are used: block4 and Gset are genuine definitions. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- Slight formalization choices (index type I, phrasing with ∃ S : Subgroup) are standard and faithful to the statement. Including the det(A*C) ≠ 0 condition on GL-members is consistent and effectively equivalent for block upper-triangular matrices.

  - For any group G and elements a, b in G with the relations a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1, and b a = a^2 b,
  - the subgroup of G generated by {a, b}, considered as a type with its induced group structure, is group-isomorphic to `Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` (i.e., a cyclic group of order 2 under multiplication, which is isomorphic to Z_2 under addition).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that the group given by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^2 b⟩ is isomorphic to Z_2.""
- The Lean theorem asserts a slightly stronger, but standardly equivalent, formulation: in any group G that has elements a and b satisfying those relations, the subgroup generated by a and b is isomorphic to Z_2. This implies that the abstract group defined by the presentation (the initial object with those relations) is also isomorphic to Z_2. Using `Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` is a standard way in Lean to represent the cyclic group of order 2 as a multiplicative group; this matches Z_2 up to canonical isomorphism.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts used are from Mathlib. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this task, since we are judging the statement, not the proof.

Final check:
- Relations match exactly: a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1, and ba = a^2 b.
- Target group matches (Z_2), represented as `Multiplicative (ZMod 2)`.
- The use of the subgroup generated by a and b in an arbitrary ambient group is a faithful and standard reformulation of the presented-group statement.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation (indeed, a slight generalization) of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: We work in a group G, with an indexed family of subgroups H : Fin n → Subgroup G.

- Definition `is_internal_direct_product_family`:
  This asserts that every g ∈ G has a unique decomposition as an ordered product of one element from each subgroup H k. Formally, for each g there exists a unique function f : Fin n → G such that (i) for all k, f k ∈ H k, and (ii) g equals the product f 0 * f 1 * ... * f (n-1), expressed via `List.ofFn f` and `List.foldl` with multiplication starting from 1. This is a meaningful, non-vacuous condition expressing unique factorization across the family H.

- Theorem `srdoty_alg_products_363`:
  Assuming `h : is_internal_direct_product_family H` and given distinct indices i ≠ j, it claims the set-theoretic intersection of the underlying sets of H i and H j equals the singleton set {1}. In symbols: (H i : Set G) ∩ (H j : Set G) = {1}.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If G is the internal direct product of normal subgroups H_1, ..., H_n, then for any i ≠ j, H_i ∩ H_j = {1}.

- The code uses a specific formalization of “internal direct product” as the unique ordered-decomposition property. It does not explicitly require normality or commutativity. However, this property is a standard necessary feature of an internal direct product and is sufficient to deduce pairwise trivial intersections. In fact, the conclusion (pairwise trivial intersection) follows from uniqueness of decomposition alone; normality is not needed for that particular conclusion. Thus, the code proves a slightly more general statement than the natural language claim, which is acceptable per the guidelines.

- The conclusion in the code is stated as equality of sets rather than equality of subgroups. Since {1} as a subgroup has the underlying set {1}, this is equivalent to the usual group-theoretic statement H_i ∩ H_j = {1}.

- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary definition is legitimate.

Final comparison:
- The code assumes a (possibly weaker) but standard and meaningful condition (unique factorization) that is implied by being an internal direct product of normal subgroups and proves exactly the required consequence (pairwise trivial intersections). This is a faithful, even slightly stronger, formalization of the claim’s content.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language and assess.
- variable (n : Nat): Fix a natural number n.
- def is_orthogonal (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) : Prop := Aᵀ * A = 1
  Meaning: An n×n real matrix A is orthogonal if A^T A = I. This is the usual condition (equivalent to A A^T = I for square matrices over ℝ), so this is fine.
- def O_n : Type := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // is_orthogonal n A}
  Meaning: The orthogonal group O(n) modeled as the subtype of matrices that satisfy the orthogonality predicate. Note: This only defines the set/type, not the group structure.
- def SO_n : Type := {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // is_orthogonal n A ∧ Matrix.det A = (1 : ℝ)}
  Meaning: The special orthogonal group as the subtype of matrices that are orthogonal and have determinant 1. Again, just a set/type, not a subgroup structure.
- lemma orthogonal_conj_preserves_det ... : det (A * B * Aᵀ) = det B := by sorry
  Meaning: If A is orthogonal (and B is orthogonal, though that hypothesis is unnecessary), then det(A B A^T) = det B. This is mathematically true because det(A^T)=det(A) and for orthogonal A, det(A)^2=1. The inclusion of hB is superfluous but harmless to the statement.
- lemma SO_normal : ∀ (A : O_n n) (B : SO_n n), is_orthogonal n (A.1 * B.1 * (A.1)ᵀ) ∧ det (A.1 * B.1 * (A.1)ᵀ) = 1 := by sorry
  Meaning: For any orthogonal A and special orthogonal B, the conjugate A B A^T is orthogonal and has determinant 1. This expresses that conjugation by an orthogonal matrix preserves the defining properties of SO(n). However, it does not state or use any subgroup or normal subgroup structure; it’s just a closure-under-conjugation property stated at the level of elements.
- lemma O_quot_SO_equiv_units_int : True := by sorry
  Meaning: A lemma whose statement is just True. This is a vacuous placeholder and does not even state the intended isomorphism O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^×.

Step 2: Does the whole formalization faithfully translate the original statement?
- The original statement asks to prove: (i) SO(n) ◁ O(n) (SO(n) is a normal subgroup of O(n)), and (ii) O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^× (the unit group of ℤ, i.e., {±1}).
- For (i): The code does not formalize group structures or subgroups; it only defines the sets/types O_n and SO_n. The lemma SO_normal asserts the key conjugation-invariance property, which is necessary for normality, but it does not assert that SO(n) is a subgroup of O(n), nor does it use Mathlib’s Subgroup or Normal concepts. Thus it captures part of the content (conjugation invariance), but not the full “normal subgroup” statement in a faithful way.
- For (ii): The code completely fails to state the isomorphism. The lemma is a placeholder with statement True, not even close to expressing an isomorphism between a quotient group and Units ℤ. Moreover, there is no quotient group defined since no group structure is set up on O_n and SO_n in this file.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Major discrepancy: The second part O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^× is not stated at all; instead a vacuous lemma True is provided. This fails the translation.
- Structural mismatch: The normal subgroup property is not stated using subgroup/normal subgroup structures; only an elementwise conjugation-preservation lemma is given. While suggestive, it is not a faithful formalization of SO(n) ◁ O(n).
- Additional issues: The code does not use Mathlib’s existing orthogonalGroup or SpecialOrthogonalGroup structures and does not connect to QuotientGroup or Units ℤ. The orthogonal_conj_preserves_det lemma includes an unnecessary hypothesis on B.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. The most severe issue is the vacuous placeholder for the quotient isomorphism and the lack of any quotient/group structure in the statements.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators` just set up the environment and notation for sums.
- `variable {n : ℕ}` declares the dimension n.
- The theorem `orthogonal_matrix_columns_dot (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) (h : A.transpose * A = 1)`:
  - A is an n×n real matrix (indices are `Fin n`, i.e., 0..n-1, which is a benign indexing difference from 1..n in the natural statement).
  - The hypothesis `h : A.transpose * A = 1` states that Aᵀ A equals the identity matrix. This is exactly the defining property of an orthogonal matrix (i.e., A ∈ O(n)).
- The conclusion `∀ (i j : Fin n), (∑ k : Fin n, A k i * A k j) = if i = j then (1 : ℝ) else 0` says: for all column indices i, j, the sum over k of `A k i * A k j` equals 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise. The left-hand side is precisely the standard dot product of the i-th and j-th columns of A, since it sums over the row index k of the product of the entries in columns i and j. The right-hand side is the Kronecker delta δ_ij.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let A ∈ O(n) with column vectors A₁, …, Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ. Show that A_i · A_j = δ_{ij} for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, with · the standard dot product.
- Lean hypothesis `A.transpose * A = 1` is equivalent to A ∈ O(n). The conclusion expresses exactly that the dot product of columns i and j is δ_ij, using the explicit coordinate-sum definition of the dot product. The index set `Fin n` corresponds to {1,…,n} up to a shift, which is a harmless formalization detail.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem directly states the desired property. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per the instructions, this is acceptable as we're checking the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

Final check: The two statements are mathematically the same. There are no discrepancies: the code is a faithful formalization of the claim that columns of an orthogonal matrix are orthonormal.

- Both proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable here since we are auditing the statement, not its proof.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement demands: Fix an integer n > 1 and for all a, b, c in Z, show left and right distributivity in Z/nZ using congruence classes [x].
- The Lean code uses `n : ℕ` (natural number) with hypothesis `1 < n`, and `a b c : Int`, casting each to `ZMod n` via `(x : ZMod n)`, exactly representing the congruence class [x] modulo n.
- It states both distributive equalities separately, matching the original.
- Using `n : ℕ` instead of `n : ℤ` is the standard formalization in mathlib for ZMod; requiring `1 < n` matches the original condition and is harmless even if unused in the statement.

3) Final check: Same or different?
- They are the same: both express left and right distributivity of multiplication over addition in Z/nZ for fixed n > 1 and arbitrary integers a, b, c. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced, only theorem statements. No changes in meaning or scope beyond the standard formalization choice of `n : ℕ`.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

3) Final check and potential differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses `Fin n` (0-based indices) rather than 1..n; this is a harmless difference and equivalent.
- δ_{ij} is represented as `if i = j then 1 else 0` in ℝ, which matches the Kronecker delta in this context.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `def H0 : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix H0 with entries: (0,0) = 1, (0,1) = 0, (1,0) = 0, and (1,1) = -1. This is exactly the matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]].
- `noncomputable def R (a : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix R(a) with entries: (0,0) = cos a, (0,1) = -sin a, (1,0) = sin a, (1,1) = cos a. This is the standard rotation matrix [[cos a, -sin a],[sin a, cos a]].
- `theorem rotation_conj_H0 (θ : ℝ) : R (2 * θ) * H0 * R (2 * θ) = H0 := by sorry` states that for any real θ, the matrix product R(2θ) * H0 * R(2θ) equals H0. The proof is omitted, but the statement is clear and precise.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement asks to show R_{2θ} H0 R_{2θ} = H0 for all θ ∈ ℝ, with H0 = [[1,0],[0,-1]] and R_{2θ} = [[cos(2θ), -sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), cos(2θ)]].
- The Lean code exactly defines H0 and R(a) as those matrices and states the equality R(2θ) * H0 * R(2θ) = H0 for all θ.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence and discrepancies.
- Matrix definitions match precisely.
- The theorem’s quantification over θ ∈ ℝ matches.
- The product ordering R(2θ) * H0 * R(2θ) matches the natural statement.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions are present. Using Fin 2 indices is standard and covers exactly the 2×2 entries.
- Using real matrices aligns with cos and sin being real-valued.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: “Show that for every θ ∈ R, the rotation operator ρ_θ: R^2 → R^2, defined by ρ_θ(X) = R_θ X, fixes the origin.”
- The code precisely defines the rotation operator via the standard rotation matrix formula and states that it fixes the origin for every θ. The domain and codomain are R^2 represented as ℝ × ℝ. This is a faithful formalization.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `structure M22` defines a custom type for 2x2 real matrices as a record with entries a, b, c, d.
- `instance : Inhabited M22 := ⟨M22.mk 0 0 0 0⟩` gives a default (zero) matrix.
- `def of_ab (a b : ℝ) : M22 := ⟨a, -b, b, a⟩` defines the special form matrix [[a, -b], [b, a]].
- `def zero_mat : M22 := of_ab 0 0` defines the zero matrix (indeed [[0, 0], [0, 0]]).
- `def is_form (M : M22) : Prop := ∃ a b : ℝ, M = of_ab a b` says a matrix is of the special form iff it equals [[a, -b], [b, a]] for some a, b.
- `def G : Set M22 := { M | is_form M }` defines G as the set of all matrices of that form.
- `def G' : Set M22 := G \ { zero_mat }` defines G' as G minus the singleton {zero matrix}.
- `def G'_subtype := { M : M22 // is_form M ∧ M ≠ zero_mat }` defines the subtype corresponding to G', i.e., elements of the form along with a proof they are not the zero matrix.
- `noncomputable def G'_group : Group G'_subtype := by sorry` asserts that G'_subtype has a group structure, but provides no data (multiplication, identity, inverses) or proofs; it uses `sorry` to fill everything.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication. This entails: (1) using the usual matrix multiplication on 2×2 real matrices, (2) showing closure, associativity, identity, and inverses within G'.
- The code does not define matrix multiplication on `M22` at all. It also does not specify that the group operation is matrix multiplication.
- The final line constructs an arbitrary `Group G'_subtype` via `sorry`, which is a vacuous placeholder for both operations and proofs. This is not a mere omission of a proof; it omits and fabricates the entire algebraic structure.
- Therefore, the code does not faithfully capture “under matrix multiplication.” It does define the correct underlying set G and G', but it does not relate the group structure to matrix multiplication in any way.

Final check: same or different?
- Different. The math problem demands proving that G' forms a group with standard matrix multiplication. The code only asserts the existence of some group structure on G' via `sorry` without defining multiplication or showing that it is matrix multiplication. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Grade rationale:
- It correctly represents the set G and G'. However, it fabricates the group structure by `sorry` and does not tie it to matrix multiplication. According to the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions but if that were fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful,” so a grade around 6 is appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: We work in Mathlib and use `Equiv`-related notions, notably `Perm` (the symmetric group as permutations) and `swap` (the transposition of two elements).
- The theorem `symmetric_group_generated_by_adjacent_transpositions (n : Nat) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : ...` states: For a natural number `n` with `2 ≤ n`, consider the symmetric group `Perm (Fin n)` (i.e., S_n on the set `{0,1,...,n-1}`). The subgroup generated by a certain set of permutations equals the whole group (top subgroup `⊤`).
- The generating set is described as `{ s : Perm (Fin n) | ∃ i : Fin (n - 1), ... s = swap a b }`. Here, `i : Fin (n - 1)` ranges over indices `0,1,...,n-2`. The code defines `a : Fin n` as a coercion of `i` into `Fin n` (intended as the natural inclusion of the first `n-1` elements), and `b : Fin n` as the successor `i.succ` (which is the next element in `Fin n`). Then `s = swap a b` is the adjacent transposition swapping those two adjacent positions. The subgroup closure of these swaps is claimed to be the entire symmetric group on `Fin n`.
- While the casts used (`Fin.cast` with a proof term) are syntactically elaborate, their clear intent is to view `i : Fin (n-1)` as an element of `Fin n` (for `a`) and to take its successor in `Fin n` (for `b`), hence forming the adjacent transpositions `(i, i.succ)` for all `i` in `Fin (n-1)`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: “Let n ≥ 2. Prove that S_n is generated by the set of adjacent transpositions {(1,2),(2,3),…, (n−1,n)}.”
- The Lean code formalizes S_n as `Perm (Fin n)` and states that the subgroup generated by the adjacent transpositions `(i, i+1)` (implemented as `swap a b` with `a` corresponding to `i` and `b = i.succ`) is the whole group. This is precisely the standard formulation, with `Fin n` using 0-based indexing rather than 1-based, which is an inessential difference.
- The conclusion `Subgroup.closure (...) = ⊤` matches “is generated by.” The hypothesis `hn : 2 ≤ n` matches `n ≥ 2` in the natural language.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Indexing difference (0-based `Fin n` vs 1-based {1,...,n}) is standard and harmless; the sets of adjacent transpositions correspond exactly under reindexing.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; it’s a single theorem statement with the generating set explicitly described. The `sorry` is only for the proof and is allowed under the instructions.
- The somewhat baroque casts in defining `a` and `b` are implementation details to coerce indices into `Fin n` and take successors; they do not change the mathematical content. Conceptually, the set is exactly the set of adjacent transpositions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

- `noncomputable def R (φ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ![![Real.cos φ, -Real.sin φ], ![Real.sin φ, Real.cos φ]]` defines the rotation matrix R(φ) = [[cos φ, -sin φ], [sin φ, cos φ]].

- `theorem H_eq (θ : ℝ) : H θ = H0 * R (-2 * θ) := by sorry` states the equality H(θ) = H₀ · R(−2θ) for all real θ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: For each θ ∈ ℝ, H_θ = H_0 R_{−2θ}, with H₀ = [[1,0],[0,−1]] and R_φ = [[cos φ, −sin φ],[sin φ, cos φ]]. The Lean code defines exactly those matrices and states the theorem H θ = H0 * R (−2*θ). The multiplication order matches (H₀ followed by R_{−2θ}). The entries in H(θ) are consistent with computing H₀ R(−2θ), since R(−2θ) = [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [−sin(2θ), cos(2θ)]] and multiplying on the left by H₀ = diag(1, −1) yields [[cos(2θ), sin(2θ)], [sin(2θ), −cos(2θ)]], which matches the definition of H(θ).

They are the same. The code introduces no vacuous placeholders; all auxiliary definitions are concrete and standard. The theorem statement exactly matches the natural language claim.

The Lean theorem states precisely the general “in other words” formulation. Since exp satisfies the hypotheses, the result applies to e^z. There are no extra/vacuous definitions, and only the statement is given (proof omitted), which is acceptable per instructions.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Domains/codomains match (ℂ → ℂ), the functional equation and normalization f(0)=1 match, and the conclusion ∀ z, f z ≠ 0 matches. The code gives a slight generalization consistent with the “in other words” clause. No discrepancies.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := fun p => ... (cos θ * x - sin θ * y, sin θ * x + cos θ * y)`
  This defines the map ρ_θ from ℝ × ℝ to ℝ × ℝ by the standard rotation matrix formula: if p = (x, y), then ρ_θ(p) = (cos θ x − sin θ y, sin θ x + cos θ y). This is exactly multiplication by the matrix [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]].

- `theorem rho_apply_formula (θ x y : ℝ) : rho θ (x, y) = (cos θ * x - sin θ * y, sin θ * x + cos θ * y)`
  This restates the definition in component form for a pair (x, y).

- `theorem rho_preserves_squared_norm (θ x y : ℝ) : (rho θ (x,y)).1 ^ 2 + (rho θ (x,y)).2 ^ 2 = x^2 + y^2`
  This asserts that ρ_θ preserves the squared Euclidean norm: ||ρ_θ(x, y)||^2 = ||(x, y)||^2. This is a key property of rotations (length preservation, hence isometry) and implies it fixes the origin (since ρ_θ(0,0) = (0,0) from the formula).

- `theorem rho_dot_product (θ x y : ℝ) : x * (rho θ (x,y)).1 + y * (rho θ (x,y)).2 = cos θ * (x^2 + y^2)`
  This asserts that the dot product ⟨(x, y), ρ_θ(x, y)⟩ equals cos θ times the squared length of (x, y). Together with the previous lemma, this matches the identity ⟨X, R_θ X⟩ = ||X||^2 cos θ, i.e., the cosine of the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) is cos θ.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness
- The code defines the exact map ρ_θ as multiplication by the standard rotation matrix. This agrees with the natural language setup.
- The auxiliary theorems show two hallmark properties of rotation: preservation of length and the cos(θ) relation for the angle between X and ρ_θ(X). These strongly support the interpretation of ρ_θ as rotation by θ about the origin.

Step 3: Compare with the original statement
- The original statement asks to show that ρ_θ is a rotation through θ; equivalently, for any X, ρ_θ(X) is X rotated by θ about the origin.
- The code does not state an explicit final theorem saying “ρ_θ is a rotation by angle θ about the origin.” Instead, it provides supporting lemmas (norm preservation and dot-product identity) that are consistent with and essentially characterize the rotation. However, the angle characterization via dot product only pins down the cosine of the angle; to fully rule out a rotation by −θ, one might also include a sine/area or orientation condition (e.g., det-related identity). The definition of ρ_θ via the specific matrix already fixes the orientation correctly, but this is not explicitly expressed as a final claim.
- There are no vacuous placeholders: the definition of ρ is genuine, and the theorems are substantive (despite the `sorry` proofs). No illegitimate auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion
- The code is very close to a faithful formalization: it defines the correct map and states key properties that demonstrate it is a rotation. However, it lacks a single consolidated theorem explicitly asserting “ρ_θ is the rotation through θ” (e.g., as a linear isometry with determinant 1, or a statement about sending any vector to its θ-rotated image), and it does not explicitly assert the orientation/‘sine’ condition. Therefore it is almost faithful but not perfectly matching the natural language statement in a single final proposition.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `noncomputable def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real rotation matrix R_θ with entries: R_θ(0,0)=cos θ, R_θ(0,1)=−sin θ, R_θ(1,0)=sin θ, R_θ(1,1)=cos θ. This matches the standard rotation matrix.
- `noncomputable def H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real reflection matrix across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis. It sets u = (cos θ, sin θ) and defines H_θ = 2 u uᵀ − I, which is the standard formula for reflection across the line spanned by u in ℝ².
- `theorem O2_eq_rotations_reflections : { M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ | M * Mᵀ = 1 } = (range R) ∪ (range H)` states that the set of all 2×2 real matrices M with M Mᵀ = I (i.e., orthogonal matrices, O(2)) equals the union of the images of the maps θ ↦ R_θ and θ ↦ H_θ; i.e., every orthogonal 2×2 matrix is either a rotation or a reflection, and conversely every such rotation/reflection is orthogonal.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement describes O(2) as the union of the set of rotations R_θ and reflections H_θ, with θ ∈ ℝ. The Lean code defines these two families exactly and states the equality of sets: O(2) = {R_θ} ∪ {H_θ}. Here, O(2) is represented as {M | M Mᵀ = 1}, which is the standard characterization of orthogonal matrices over ℝ.
- The definitions of R_θ and H_θ in code match the given formulas and geometric descriptions.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- There are no artificial/vacuous placeholders; R and H are concrete, standard definitions. The theorem statement matches the mathematical content exactly: O(2) as the set of orthogonal 2×2 real matrices equals the union of rotations and reflections parameterized by θ ∈ ℝ. Using Set.range for {R_θ} and {H_θ} is standard.
- Minor formalization detail: O(2) is expressed as {M | M Mᵀ = 1} rather than using a named constant, but this is a faithful formalization. The union via Set.range corresponds precisely to {R_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} ∪ {H_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}. No substantive discrepancies.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_824 (n : ℤ) (hn : 0 < n) (a b c : ℤ) : ... := by sorry` introduces n as an integer with the hypothesis `hn : 0 < n` (so n is a positive integer), and a, b, c as integers. The goal is a conjunction of three properties:
  - `(a ≡ a [ZMOD n])`: reflexivity of congruence modulo n.
  - `(a ≡ b [ZMOD n] → b ≡ a [ZMOD n])`: symmetry of congruence modulo n.
  - `(a ≡ b [ZMOD n] → b ≡ c [ZMOD n] → a ≡ c [ZMOD n])`: transitivity of congruence modulo n.
  Here, `a ≡ b [ZMOD n]` is Mathlib's notation for integer congruence modulo n (Int.ModEq n a b).

2) Whole translation vs. original statement:
- The natural language statement: Let n be a fixed positive integer, and a, b, c ∈ ℤ. Prove that congruence modulo n is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (i.e., a ≡ a (mod n); if a ≡ b then b ≡ a; and if a ≡ b and b ≡ c then a ≡ c).
- The Lean statement exactly encodes these three properties for integers a, b, c and modulus n, with an explicit hypothesis `0 < n` matching “fixed positive integer.” The use of `[ZMOD n]` matches “mod n.”

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain and parameters align: n is an integer with `0 < n`, a, b, c are integers. This faithfully captures “n a positive integer; a, b, c ∈ ℤ.”
- Properties listed match reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity exactly.
- No extraneous assumptions are introduced; no properties are omitted.
- Packaging them as a conjunction is consistent with the problem's request to prove these properties.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open; f: U → ℂ holomorphic; if |f| has a local maximum at z0 ∈ U, then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0.
- Lean statement uses f: ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, which is the standard formalization of a holomorphic function on an open subset U. The hypothesis about a local maximum is given by existence of a small ball contained in U on which |f| ≤ |f(z0)|, which is equivalent to the usual notion of local maximum at z0. The conclusion asserts the existence of a ball around z0 (inside U) on which f is equal to the constant value f z0, i.e., locally constant near z0. This matches the natural statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain handling: The natural statement has f: U → ℂ; Lean uses a global function f: ℂ → ℂ with differentiability restricted to U. This is a standard formalization and is equivalent for this purpose.
- The local maximum condition explicitly chooses a ball contained in U; this is equivalent to the usual neighborhood formulation and poses no mismatch.
- The conclusion states constancy with value f z0; this is exactly what “constant in a neighborhood of z0” entails.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

- The two statements are the same mathematically. No discrepancies in coefficients, signs, or arguments. The identity is correctly over ℂ.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Bring in the math library and open the Matrix namespace.
- `noncomputable def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...`: Defines the 2×2 real matrix R(θ) indexed by `Fin 2 × Fin 2`. The definition by cases is:
  • entry (0,0) = cos θ
  • entry (0,1) = − sin θ
  • entry (1,0) = sin θ
  • entry (1,1) = cos θ
  This is exactly the standard rotation matrix.
- `theorem rotation_in_SO2 (θ : ℝ) : (R θ).transpose * R θ = 1 ∧ det (R θ) = 1 := by sorry`: States that for each real θ, the transpose of R(θ) times R(θ) equals the identity matrix, and the determinant of R(θ) equals 1. The proof is omitted, but only the statement matters for translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement is that for every θ ∈ ℝ, the matrix R_θ = [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]] belongs to SO(2). In standard terms, membership in SO(2) means the matrix is orthogonal (RᵀR = I) and has determinant 1. The Lean theorem asserts exactly these two properties for R(θ). The definition of R matches the given matrix. The universal quantification over θ is achieved by making θ a parameter of the theorem.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code does not explicitly refer to the Mathlib type `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` (SO(2)) but instead spells out the defining conditions: orthogonality and determinant 1. This is an equivalent formulation of “belongs to SO(2).”
- There are no vacuous or misleading auxiliary definitions; `R` is defined correctly. The use of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable for translation auditing since we only check the statement, not the proof.
- No discrepancies in dimensions or fields: it is a 2×2 real matrix.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def toComplex (p : ℝ × ℝ) : ℂ := p.1 + p.2 * Complex.I`
  This identifies a vector (x, y) in ℝ² with the complex number x + yi.

- `noncomputable def rho (θ : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ -> ℝ × ℝ := fun ⟨x, y⟩ => (x * Real.cos θ - y * Real.sin θ, x * Real.sin θ + y * Real.cos θ)`
  This defines the map ρ_θ: ℝ² → ℝ² as the standard rotation by angle θ via the usual rotation matrix.

- `theorem angle_between_rho_eq {θ : ℝ} {X : ℝ × ℝ} (hX : toComplex X ≠ 0) (hθ : θ ∈ Set.Ioc (-Real.pi) Real.pi) (hsum : (toComplex X).arg + θ ∈ Set.Ioc (-Real.pi) Real.pi) : (toComplex (rho θ X)).arg = (toComplex X).arg + θ := by sorry`
  This theorem asserts: if X ≠ 0 (as a complex number), θ lies in the principal range (-π, π], and moreover the sum of the argument of X and θ also lies in the principal range, then the principal argument of ρ_θ(X) equals the principal argument of X plus θ. In other words, under these branch-cut hypotheses, rotation by θ adds θ to the complex argument.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: for any real θ and any nonzero X ∈ ℝ², the angle between X and ρ_θ(X) equals θ, hence ρ_θ is rotation by θ. This is unconditional in θ and X (aside from X ≠ 0) and talks about the relative angle between the two vectors. The code, however, is phrased in terms of complex arguments in the principal branch and imposes two extra conditions: θ ∈ (-π, π] and (arg X + θ) ∈ (-π, π]. These are significant restrictions not present in the original statement. Moreover, the code speaks about the absolute principal arguments rather than the (signed) angle between X and ρ_θ(X). While the conclusion about argument addition implies the desired angle relation when the branch conditions are satisfied, it does not cover all θ nor does it define the angle between vectors directly; it instead uses the complex argument with branch constraints.

3) Final comparison:
- Domain of θ: Natural language allows any θ ∈ ℝ; code restricts θ to (-π, π].
- Additional hypothesis: Code also requires arg(X) + θ ∈ (-π, π], which is extraneous relative to the original.
- Notion of angle: Natural language speaks about the angle between vectors; code uses complex principal argument equality, which only implies the desired relation under branch assumptions and does not address the global mod 2π nature.

Therefore, the code is a specialized, conditional statement that captures a related idea (argument addition under principal-branch conditions) but is not a faithful translation of the original unconditional claim. No vacuous definitions are used; the auxiliary definitions are legitimate. However, due to the restrictive hypotheses and different framing (principal arg vs general angle), it is not faithful.

Proof omitted. Note: the statement concludes that the generated subgroup is all of G, not merely O2. The hypothesis mentions O2 but it does not appear in the conclusion.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is specific: In the concrete group O(2), the subgroup SO(2) and any fixed improper orthogonal matrix A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2) generate O(2). Symbolically: ⟨SO(2) ∪ {A}⟩ = O(2).
- The first Lean theorem is a general lemma that, if instantiated with G = O(2), H = SO(2), and a = A (with the known fact that SO(2) has index 2 in O(2)), yields the desired conclusion: the generated subgroup equals ⊤ in the ambient group, which in this instantiation is O(2) itself. As a general lemma, it faithfully captures the intended mechanism.
- The second theorem, aiming to be a “concrete formulation,” is not faithful to the intended O(2) statement. It asserts that ⟨SO2 ∪ {A}⟩ = ⊤ in the ambient group G, regardless of O2, and does not conclude ⟨SO2 ∪ {A}⟩ = O2. It also assumes SO2 has index 2 in G (not in O2), which is strictly stronger and typically not the intended hypothesis. The appearance of O2 in the hypotheses is unused in the conclusion, reflecting a mismatch: the result should either live in the group O2 (so the right-hand side is O2) or one should set G = O2 from the outset.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- The first theorem matches the abstract group-theoretic essence and is a correct generalization that can be instantiated to the O(2)/SO(2) situation. This part is faithful.
- The second theorem, which purports to be the concrete O(2) formulation, is not the same as the natural language statement: it concludes generation of the whole ambient group G, not of O2, and places the index-2 condition on SO2 in G rather than in O2. This is a substantive discrepancy.

Other checks:
- There are no vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with `sorry` proofs, which is acceptable given the instruction that proofs are omitted.
- Mathlib structures are used appropriately.

Conclusion: Because the “concrete” theorem does not faithfully state the O(2) claim and uses the wrong ambient group in the conclusion, the translation as presented is not faithful overall, despite the correct abstract lemma.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `schwarz_lemma` is stated for a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
- Hypothesis `h_maps : ∀ z, |z| < 1 → |f z| < 1` says: for every complex number z with modulus less than 1, the image f z also has modulus less than 1. This encodes that f maps the open unit disk into itself.
- Hypothesis `h0 : f 0 = 0` matches the condition f(0) = 0.
- Hypothesis `h_diff : DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0` says f is complex differentiable at 0.
- Conclusion: `|deriv f 0| ≤ 1`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original statement: f is a holomorphic map from the unit disk 𝔻 to itself and f(0) = 0; then |f'(0)| ≤ 1.
- The Lean code models the mapping property correctly via `h_maps` and includes `f(0)=0`.
- Crucial discrepancy: the original requires f to be holomorphic on the whole unit disk (i.e., complex differentiable on an open neighborhood of each point in 𝔻), whereas the Lean code only assumes `DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0` (complex differentiable at 0). This is a much weaker hypothesis and is not faithful to the Schwarz lemma’s assumptions. Typically, Schwarz lemma needs holomorphic on 𝔻 (or at least in a neighborhood of 0) to conclude the derivative bound; being differentiable at a single point is far too weak.
- The domain/codomain type difference (ℂ → ℂ with a disk-mapping predicate vs. 𝔻 → 𝔻) is acceptable as a formalization choice, but the missing holomorphic-on-𝔻 condition is not.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same: the Lean theorem lacks the essential hypothesis that f is holomorphic on the unit disk (or even in a neighborhood of 0). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

How to make it faithful:
- Add a hypothesis like `HolomorphicOn f (Metric.ball 0 1)` or `AnalyticOn ℂ f (Metric.ball 0 1)`, or formulate f on the subtype for the unit disk with holomorphicity there.

  This defines the power series whose coefficient at X^r is 1 if r is a multiple of k and 0 otherwise. Equivalently, this is the series 1 + X^k + X^{2k} + …, i.e., (1 - X^k)^{-1} in formal power series over ℤ.

  This purports to assert: for an arbitrary function p : ℕ → ℤ, for every n, p n equals the coefficient of X^n in the finite product ∏_{k=1}^n support_series(k). Note it quantifies universally over p, not existentially or by definition.

2) Assessment vs the intended statement:
- The natural language statement claims the generating function identity ∑_{n=0}^∞ p(n) x^n = ∏_{k=1}^∞ 1/(1 - x^k), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n. Formally, this means: the coefficient of X^n in the infinite product equals p(n) for all n, and p(n) is the partition function.
- The code does not refer to the partition function at all; it introduces an arbitrary p.
- Worse, the theorem universally quantifies over p: it states that any function p equals the coefficient sequence of the finite product, which is false and unrelated to the intended meaning. If anything, one would need either: (a) define p by that coefficient formula, or (b) existence of p with that property; and (c) relate the finite product (up to n) to the infinite product (which is acceptable for coefficients of degree n), and (d) identify p with the partition numbers.
- The code only mentions a finite product up to k = n. It never states the infinite Euler product nor the equality of generating functions.
- Although `support_series k` indeed matches (1 - X^k)^{-1}, the theorem does not use this fact, nor does it connect to the infinite product.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: equality of generating function with infinite product, for the partition function p(n).
- Code: a (universally quantified) assertion that an arbitrary p’s nth value equals the coefficient of X^n in a finite product ∏_{k=1}^n support_series(k), with no reference to partitions or the infinite product.
- Differences: universal vs existential/definitional quantification of p; finite product vs infinite product generating function; absence of partition interpretation; no series equality. These are substantial discrepancies.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

No explicit construction is given (proof is sorry), and importantly e is not specified to be σ ↦ the unit built from perm_matrix σ.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The statement defines permutation matrices as obtained by permuting columns of the identity (equivalently, exactly one 1 in each row and column, others 0), and asks to prove that S_n is isomorphic to the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL_n(F) via the specific map α ↦ P_α, where P_α is the matrix obtained by applying α to the columns.
- The code provides a reasonable predicate is_perm_matrix that captures the characterization by having a single 1 per row and column and zeros otherwise.
- The code defines perm_matrix with entries 1 iff i = σ j. This corresponds to permuting rows of the identity by σ, not columns. The docstring claims “applying σ to the columns,” which is incorrect given the formula. However, this perm_matrix is not used in the theorem.
- The theorem only asserts the existence of some Equiv that is multiplicative; it does not identify this equivalence with the explicit map σ ↦ perm_matrix σ, nor with the columns-permutation map specified in the natural language statement. Thus the crucial “via the map α ↦ P_α” part is missing. The theorem proves existence of a group isomorphism (Equiv + multiplicativity suffices to get a group isomorphism), but not the specific map.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Differences:
  - The code does not tie the isomorphism to the explicit map α ↦ P_α. It merely posits existence of an Equiv with multiplicativity.
  - The provided perm_matrix corresponds to row permutations, not column permutations as stated in the problem, and is not used to define the isomorphism.
  - The code uses a subtype of Units with the permutation-matrix predicate, matching the subgroup in GL_n(F), which is fine.
- Because the natural language requires the specific isomorphism given by α ↦ P_α (columns permutation), while the code only claims existence and doesn’t identify the explicit map (and the defined perm_matrix mismatches the “columns” description), the translation is not fully faithful, though it is very close in spirit.

Given these issues, this is a near pass but not faithful to the “via the map α ↦ P_α” requirement.

- The inverse claim (ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{−θ} is expressed as `(rho θ) ∘ (rho (-θ)) = id`. While this is only one side of the inverse relation, the code also includes `rho_comm`, from which the other side `(rho (-θ)) ∘ (rho θ) = id` follows, so together they fully express the intended inverse statement.
- The ""in particular, rotations commute"" part is explicitly stated as `rho_comm`, which in fact follows from `rho_comp` and commutativity of real addition.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code cleanly formalizes the plane rotation ρ_θ and states the three desired properties: angle-additivity under composition, inverse via negation (up to showing both sides, which is implied by commutativity also stated), and commutativity of rotations. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions. The statements align with the natural language, with only a minor nuance that the inverse is presented as one-sided composition with identity, but the included commutativity gives the full inverse property. Overall, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `theorem conformal_at_iff_hasDerivAt_ne_zero {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ} {f' : ℂ} (h : HasDerivAt f f' z0) : ConformalAt (fun z : ℂ => f z) z0 ↔ f' ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let f: ℂ → ℂ, z0 ∈ ℂ, and let f' ∈ ℂ be such that f has complex derivative f' at z0. Then f is conformal at z0 if and only if f' ≠ 0. (The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; the statement itself is what we check for faithfulness.)

2) Does this match the original statement?
Original: “Suppose f: ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.” Being holomorphic implies f is complex differentiable at every point, hence in particular at z0 with derivative f'(z0). The code assumes the local hypothesis `HasDerivAt f f' z0` and concludes `ConformalAt f z0 ↔ f' ≠ 0`. This is precisely the local version of the same equivalence. The use of an explicit `f'` together with `HasDerivAt` matches the role of f'(z0) in the natural language statement. The notion `ConformalAt` in Mathlib for ℂ → ℂ aligns with the complex-analysis notion (for complex-differentiable maps, conformality at a point is equivalent to nonvanishing complex derivative there).

3) Final check: same or different?
- Domain/codomain: both ℂ → ℂ.
- Property: conformal at a point ↔ nonzero derivative at that point.
- Hypotheses: NL assumes f is holomorphic (global), code assumes f is differentiable at z0 (local). The code is a slight generalization since holomorphic ⇒ differentiable at z0. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. The statement is thus faithful, even slightly stronger/more general than required, which is acceptable per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed a standard Mathlib lemma name), matching the intended mathematical content.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `abbrev M := Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) Real` and `abbrev GL2 := Units M` set up the ambient group GL(2, R) as the group of units in the ring of 2x2 real matrices.
- `def G_set : Set GL2 := { U | ((U : M) (1 : Fin 2) (0 : Fin 2) = 0) }` defines the subset of GL(2, R) consisting of invertible matrices whose bottom-left entry is 0. With Fin 2 indexed as {0,1}, this is the set of invertible upper-triangular 2×2 real matrices. This matches the intended G (implicitly restricted to invertible ones since it is a subset of GL(2)).
- `def N_set : Set GL2 := { U | ((U : M) (1) (0) = 0) ∧ ((U : M) (0) (0) = 1) ∧ ((U : M) (1) (1) = 1) }` defines the subset of GL(2, R) whose diagonal entries are 1 and bottom-left entry is 0, i.e., the unipotent upper-triangular matrices of the form [[1, b], [0, 1]]. This matches the intended N.
- `def G : Subgroup GL2 := by sorry` is supposed to define the subgroup G, but it uses `sorry`, so it is a vacuous placeholder. Crucially, it does not assert or prove that its carrier is exactly `G_set`.
- `def N : Subgroup GL2 := by sorry` similarly is a vacuous definition of a subgroup, with no link to `N_set`.
- `def N_normal_in_G : ∀ (g : GL2) (hg : g ∈ (G : Set GL2)) (n : GL2) (hn : n ∈ (N : Set GL2)), (g * n * g⁻¹) ∈ (N : Set GL2) := by sorry` states the elementwise normality condition, but again with a `sorry`. Moreover it quantifies membership in `(G : Set GL2)` and `(N : Set GL2)`, which refer to the carriers of the previously defined (but vacuous) subgroups `G` and `N`, not to `G_set` and `N_set`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The intended mathematical statement is: define G as the set of upper-triangular real 2×2 matrices with bottom-left entry 0 that are invertible (implicitly, since it’s a subgroup of GL(2)), prove G is a subgroup of GL(2); define N as the set of those with diagonal entries 1, prove N is a subgroup and that N is normal in G.
- The code has correct set-level definitions `G_set` and `N_set` that match the intended descriptions.
- However, the crucial subgroup definitions `G` and `N` are vacuous (`sorry`) and not tied to `G_set` and `N_set`. Thus the claims “G is a subgroup” and “N is a subgroup” are not realized as the specific subgroups corresponding to the given sets; they are arbitrary subgroups introduced by placeholder proofs.
- The normality statement is also a placeholder and, worse, refers to the arbitrary `G` and `N`, not the intended `G_set` and `N_set`.
- Therefore, the code does not faithfully formalize the statement; it sets up the right sets but fails to define the subgroups and prove the required properties.

Final comparison:
- Similarity: The predicates defining `G_set` and `N_set` match the matrix-form descriptions in the problem.
- Differences: The subgroup objects `G` and `N` are not connected to these sets, and all subgroup/normality assertions are left as `sorry`. Hence the translation fails per the guidelines (auxiliary definitions are vacuous, and the final statements do not assert the intended facts about the defined sets).

Given that fixing the sorries by defining `G` and `N` with carriers `G_set` and `N_set` and proving closure and normality would make it faithful, this merits a mid-level grade per the rubric.

The Lean statement explicitly matches the natural language claim: For any `z ∈ ℂ`, `|cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|`. The coercion `(z.re : Complex)` matches taking the real part and viewing it as a complex number. The functions and inequality are precisely the same as the English statement.

3) Final check:
- Domains: Both use `z : ℂ`.
- Functions: `cos` is the complex cosine in both; on `Re z` it is cosine of a real embedded in ℂ.
- Absolute value: `Complex.abs` matches |·| on ℂ.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `lemma jirilebl_ca_ca_2441 (U : Set Complex) (f : Complex → Complex)` introduces an open set U in ℂ and a function f from ℂ to ℂ.
- `(hU : IsOpen U)` assumes U is open.
- `(hhol : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)` assumes f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- `(hder : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0)` assumes the complex derivative of f at every z in U is nonzero.
- Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V : Set Complex, IsOpen V ∧ z ∈ V ∧ (∀ x y, x ∈ V → y ∈ V → f x = f y → x = y)` asserts that for every z in U, there exists an open set V in ℂ containing z such that f is injective on V.

Assessment vs the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U, then f is locally injective on U.
- Lean hypotheses match: U open, f holomorphic on U, derivative nonzero on U.
- Codomain matches ℂ. The Lean code uses f as ℂ → ℂ rather than U → ℂ; this is a standard formalization choice since the differentiability and derivative conditions are only assumed on U. This is a benign generalization.
- Conclusion: The code states existence of an open neighborhood V of z in ℂ where f is injective on all of V. The usual phrasing “locally injective on U” is typically: ∀ z ∈ U, ∃ V open with z ∈ V ⊆ U such that f is injective on V (as a function defined on U). The Lean statement does not explicitly require V ⊆ U, but this is stronger than needed; from such a V, one can take W = V ∩ U to obtain an open neighborhood within U where f is injective. Thus, the Lean conclusion implies the usual local injectivity on U and is an acceptable, slightly stronger formulation.

No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn, deriv). The statement faithfully captures the intended mathematical content.

Final check: The two problems are the same in mathematical meaning; the Lean version is a slight strengthening (not requiring V ⊆ U), which still implies the original claim. Hence the translation is faithful.

  translates to: For any complex number z, assuming |z| < 1, we have |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|). Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus (a real number) and `Complex.log` is the principal complex logarithm, so the left-hand side is the real absolute value of the complex number log(1 − z), i.e., its modulus.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that if z ∈ C and |z| < 1, then |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).""
- The Lean theorem states exactly this, with z : ℂ, hypothesis `Complex.abs z < 1`, and conclusion `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it's a direct theorem statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only subtlety is that `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm. On the disk |z| < 1, the values 1 − z lie in the disk centered at 1 with radius 1, which stays in the right half-plane and avoids the branch cut, so the principal branch is well-defined and coincides with the analytic branch satisfying log(1) = 0. This matches the intended meaning of the natural language statement.
- There are no other discrepancies. The statements are the same.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language claim.

- `theorem holomorphic_on_analytic_on {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) : AnalyticOn ℂ f U := by sorry`
  Natural language: Let U be an open subset of ℂ, and let f : ℂ → ℂ be complex-differentiable on U (holomorphic on U). Then f is analytic on U (i.e., around every point of U there is a power series that sums to f on some neighborhood).

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The original statement has two parts:
  a) Holomorphic implies analytic: This is captured by `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` from `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` on an open set U.
  b) A more precise description: For each z₀ ∈ U, f has a Taylor series that converges in the disk {|z − z₀| < R}, where R is the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum of the series equals f on that disk.
- The Lean statement only asserts (a): holomorphic implies analytic. It does not assert the more precise radius-of-convergence statement (b), in particular the identification of the radius as the distance to the nearest singularity and maximality of the disk. AnalyticOn guarantees local power series expansion with some positive radius and equality to f on a neighborhood, but does not encode the “radius equals distance to nearest singularity” part.
- The Lean hypothesis asks only that U is open (not necessarily connected), whereas the natural language says “domain,” which typically means open and connected. This is a slight generalization and is acceptable since analyticity is a local property and does not require connectedness.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- They coincide on the core claim: holomorphic implies analytic.
- The Lean code omits the additional, stronger claim about the radius of convergence being the distance to the nearest singularity and the maximal disk characterization. Hence, it does not fully translate the entire natural language statement.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are made; the theorem is a standard Mathlib formulation. The omission is substantive but not misleading in the core implication.

Conclusion: The code captures the main implication but not the detailed statement about the radius equal to the nearest singularity. Therefore, it is not fully faithful, but it is very close on the principal claim.

- `(psi : ℂ → ℝ → ℂ)` declares a function ψ taking (z, t) ∈ ℂ × ℝ to ℂ. This corresponds to a function defined on ℂ × ℝ, but assumptions will restrict it to U × [0,1].
- `h_cont : ContinuousOn (fun p : ℂ × ℝ => psi p.1 p.2) (U ×ˢ (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1))` assumes joint continuity of ψ on U × [0,1]. Here `Icc 0 1` is the closed interval [0,1].
- `h_diff : ∀ t ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => psi z t) U` assumes that for each fixed t in [0,1], the function z ↦ ψ(z, t) is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => ∫ t in 0..1, psi z t) U` asserts that the function h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z, t) dt is complex differentiable (holomorphic) on U.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open; ψ: U × [0,1] → ℂ is continuous; for each t ∈ [0,1], z ↦ ψ(z, t) is holomorphic; then h(z) = ∫_0^1 ψ(z, t) dt is holomorphic on U.
- The Lean code matches this exactly:
  - U is open.
  - ψ is continuous on U × [0,1] (expressed via `ContinuousOn` on that set).
  - For each t in [0,1], z ↦ ψ(z, t) is holomorphic on U (`DifferentiableOn ℂ ... U`).
  - The conclusion asserts holomorphicity of h on U, with the integral over [0,1].
- Using `psi : ℂ → ℝ → ℂ` with restrictions to U × [0,1] is a standard formalization choice and faithful.
- The integral notation `∫ t in 0..1, ...` is the interval integral over [0,1], matching the statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; no placeholders.
- The only minor technical difference is ψ is declared on ℂ × ℝ but assumptions restrict to U × [0,1], which is harmless and standard.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` loads the math library.
- Comment: describes bounds for complex hyperbolic sine and cosine.
- `theorem sinh_bound (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` states: for any complex number z, the modulus of sinh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z; no proof provided.
- `theorem cosh_bound (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` states: for any complex number z, the modulus of cosh z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z; no proof provided.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language asks to prove, for all z in C, |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean statements exactly assert these two inequalities, using Complex.abs for |·|, Complex.sinh/Complex.cosh, and Real.exp for e^{·}, with the real argument |z|. No extra assumptions or alterations.

3) Final check for differences:
- Inequalities, functions, and constants match precisely.
- Using multiplication `(1/2) * exp(|z|)` is equivalent to `1/2 e^{|z|}`.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just theorem statements with placeholders for proofs, which is acceptable per the task.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  In natural language: For any complex number z, the norm (absolute value) of the complex sine of z is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the real sine of the real part of z. Here, `‖·‖` is the complex norm (absolute value) on ℂ, `Complex.sin` is the complex sine function, `z.re` is the real part of z, and `|·|` is the real absolute value.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement is exactly: For z ∈ ℂ, |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|. The Lean statement matches this precisely, with correct coercions: complex norm on the left, real absolute value of Real.sin applied to the real part on the right.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem statement is neither a generalization nor a specialization; it is exactly the same as the natural language claim.
- The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this audit as we only check translation faithfulness.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the statement.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Equiv`: We are working with Mathlib and the `Equiv` (permutations) namespace.
- The theorem `swap_conj {α : Type _} [DecidableEq α] (σ : Perm α) (x y : α) : swap (σ x) (σ y) = σ * swap x y * σ⁻¹` states: For any type α with decidable equality, any permutation σ of α, and any elements x, y in α, the conjugate of the transposition (swap) of x and y by σ is the transposition (swap) of σ x and σ y. Formally, σ • (x y) • σ⁻¹ = (σ x, σ y). The equality is written with the conjugate on the right-hand side and the swapped elements on the left, but it's symmetric. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement is specific to Sym_n acting on {1, 2, ..., n}, with α = (1,2) and β = (1,2,...,n), and it asserts that for any 1 < i < n, (i, i+1) = β^{i-1} α β^{-(i-1)} = β^{i-1} α β^{n-i+1}.
- The Lean theorem is a general conjugation property: σ * swap x y * σ⁻¹ = swap (σ x) (σ y). This is indeed the general fact that underlies the desired identity when one specializes to σ = β^{i-1}, x = 1, y = 2, and β the standard n-cycle on {1,...,n}. Under that specialization and using that β^{i-1}(1) = i and β^{i-1}(2) = i+1 (for 1 < i < n), one gets (i,i+1) = β^{i-1} (1,2) β^{-(i-1)}. 
- However, the Lean code does not formalize the specific setting of Sym_n, does not define α or β, does not restrict i, and does not include the second equality β^{-(i-1)} = β^{n - i + 1}. It only provides a general lemma that could be used to prove one part of the statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code is a related general lemma about conjugation of swaps, but it does not state the specific identity in Sym_n, nor the condition 1 < i < n, nor the second equality involving β^{n-i+1}. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the given statement; it's a tool that could be used in a proof of the statement. There are no vacuous definitions, but the theorem is not the same as the target statement. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for a translation task, but the main issue is the mismatch in specificity and missing the second equality.

Grade rationale: The code is conceptually related and would be a helpful lemma to prove the statement, but it does not actually formalize the statement itself, nor its full content. Hence, not faithful; assign a low-to-mid score.

- `theorem complex_abs_add_eq_abs_sub_iff_pure_imag {z w : ℂ} (h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w) :` sets up complex numbers z, w with the hypothesis h asserting |z| = |w|.
- `Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w) ↔ (z * Star.star w).re = 0` states the equivalence: |z + w| = |z − w| if and only if the real part of z * conj(w) is zero. In Mathlib, `Star.star w` is the complex conjugate of w, and `(·).re` extracts the real part.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is: if z, w ∈ ℂ and |z| = |w|, then |z + w| = |z − w| iff z·\bar{w} is purely imaginary. In complex analysis, “purely imaginary” is equivalently characterized by having real part zero. Thus `(z * conj w).re = 0` faithfully encodes “z \bar{w} is purely imaginary.” The conditional hypothesis |z| = |w| is present as `h`.

  - `‖ · ‖` is the norm on ℂ, equal to the usual complex modulus | · |, taking values in ℝ.
  - `^ 2` is the natural-number power, so this is |·|^2.
  - `Complex.re` takes the real part, yielding a real number.
  - `starRingEnd ℂ b` is the star endomorphism applied to b, which in ℂ is complex conjugation, i.e., `conj b` or `\bar b`.

- `theorem abs_csc_ge_abs_csc_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs ((Complex.sin z)⁻¹) ≥ Complex.abs ((Complex.sin (Complex.ofReal z.re))⁻¹) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus of the reciprocal of sin z (i.e., |csc z|) is greater than or equal to the modulus of the reciprocal of sin(Re z) (with Re z embedded into ℂ), i.e., |csc(Re z)|.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The left-hand side `Complex.abs ((Complex.sin z)⁻¹)` exactly represents |csc z| in the complex sense (since csc z = (sin z)⁻¹).
- The right-hand side uses `Complex.sin (Complex.ofReal z.re)`, which is sin of the real part, viewed as a complex number. Taking its inverse and then complex modulus yields |csc(Re z)|, consistent with the intended meaning. Complex modulus agrees with the real absolute value on real inputs, so this matches the natural language formulation.

3) Checking for discrepancies:
- The code uses the total inverse `x⁻¹` (with the Lean convention `0⁻¹ = 0`) rather than a partial function undefined at zeros of sin. Natural language typically treats csc as undefined at zeros of sin. However, this is a standard and acceptable formalization choice in Mathlib, and does not alter the inequality statement in a way that misrepresents the intended content of the problem statement. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; it's a direct theorem statement mirroring the claim.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

  - `(z : ℂ)`: Fixes an arbitrary complex number z.
  - `(h : Complex.abs z < 1)`: Assumes the hypothesis |z| < 1.
  - Conclusion: `Complex.abs (Complex.arctan z) ≤ (Real.pi / 4) * (Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z))` which reads: |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * (|z| / (1 − |z|)). The use of `Complex.abs` is modulus, `Complex.arctan` is the complex arctangent, and `Real.pi` is π.
  - The proof is omitted using `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing; the statement itself is what's being checked for faithfulness.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the natural language statement: for any z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, we have |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * |z| / (1 − |z|).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem is stated directly, with the exact hypothesis and conclusion.
- The right-hand side is a real nonnegative expression given the hypothesis, but the theorem does not need to assert positivity explicitly; division is defined and the inequality is meaningful.

  Natural language: For any complex number z with |z| < 1, the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of (|z|)^(n+1) equals |z| divided by (1 - |z|). Here `∑' n : ℕ` is the topological sum (tsum) from n = 0 to ∞, and using exponent `(n + 1)` makes it the same as ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n. The terms are real since `Complex.abs z : ℝ`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypothesis `Complex.abs z < 1` matches |z| < 1.
- The left-hand side `∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1)` matches the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n via the shift n → n+1.

- `def M (a b : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ := ...` defines the 2×2 matrix with entries over ℂ (via `Complex.ofReal`) given by [[a, -b], [b, a]]. This is exactly the real 2×2 matrix representing multiplication by the complex number a + i b, just embedded in ℂ.
- `def v_plus : Fin 2 → ℂ := ...` defines the vector v₊ = [1, -i].
- `def v_minus : Fin 2 → ℂ := ...` defines the vector v₋ = [1, i].
- The theorem `complex_number_2x2_eigen (a b : ℝ) : ...` states two explicit eigenvalue equations:
  • (M a b).mulVec v_plus = (a + i b) • v_plus
  • (M a b).mulVec v_minus = (a − i b) • v_minus
  where `a` and `b` are embedded into ℂ as `Complex.ofReal a` and `Complex.ofReal b`, and `i` is `Complex.I`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is that the 2×2 matrix representing a + i b has eigenvalues a ± i b with corresponding eigenvectors [1; ∓ i]. The code precisely constructs that matrix and those vectors, and states the defining eigenvector equations for these two eigenpairs.
- The sign pairing matches: for eigenvalue a + i b, the vector is [1; −i] (v_plus), and for a − i b, the vector is [1; i] (v_minus), exactly corresponding to [1; ∓ i].
- Although the matrix is typed with ℂ entries, they are real via `ofReal`, which matches the “real 2×2 matrix” representing the complex number; this is a standard harmless formalization detail.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. The code asserts the two eigenvalue relations explicitly, which is equivalent to saying “M has eigenvalues a ± i b with those corresponding eigenvectors.” The vectors defined are clearly nonzero (first entry is 1), so they are legitimate eigenvectors even though nonzeroness is not explicitly stated in the theorem. This is a minor formal omission that does not change the mathematical meaning here.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`/`open Finset` are setup.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_19562 (z : ℂ) : ∀ n : ℕ, ... ≤ ... := by sorry`
  asserts: For any complex number z and for all natural n, an inequality holds.
- Left-hand side:
  `Complex.abs ((Finset.sum (range (n+1)) fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z)`
  This is |sum_{k=0}^n z^k / k! − e^z|, because `range (n+1)` is {0,1,...,n}, `Nat.factorial k` is k!, cast to ℂ, and `Complex.exp z` is e^z; taking `Complex.abs` gives the complex modulus.
- Right-hand side:
  `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`
  This is |z|^{n+1} / (n+1)! · e^{|z|}. Here `Complex.abs z` is |z|, exponent ^ (n+1) is natural power, factorial is cast to ℝ, and `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is e^{|z|}.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
- Original: For z ∈ ℂ and all n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.
- Lean statement matches exactly: same sum over k=0..n, same complex exponential, same modulus and bound, same factorial indexing (n+1), and same real exponential of |z|. Types are handled appropriately (ℂ on the LHS, ℝ on the RHS via abs), which is consistent with the natural statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Summation limits, factorial indices, and functions all align.
- Casting to ℂ in the sum and to ℝ on the bound is the natural formalization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but our task is to assess the faithfulness of the statement.
- There are no extra hypotheses or weakened/strengthened claims.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The lemma states: for ε > 0, a complex polynomial p, with hypothesis hnonconst : p ≠ 0 (i.e., p is not the zero polynomial), a point z0 ∈ ℂ with p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w ∈ ℂ such that |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct lemma with a placeholder proof (by sorry).

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For ε > 0, and p a nonconstant complex polynomial (or more generally, a nonconstant power series converging on the disk {|z − z0| < ε}), with p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w in the disk with |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- The Lean lemma specializes to polynomials, which is acceptable as a specialization of the more general power series case.
- Crucial mismatch: The natural statement requires “nonconstant,” whereas the Lean hypothesis only assumes p ≠ 0 (not the zero polynomial). This allows constant nonzero polynomials, for which the conclusion is false (|p(w)| is equal to |p(z0)| for all w). Thus the Lean statement is strictly weaker in hypothesis and in fact incorrect for constant nonzero polynomials, so it does not faithfully translate the intended statement.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different. The key hypothesis “nonconstant” is not correctly encoded; using p ≠ 0 is insufficient. Everything else (ε > 0, z0 ∈ ℂ, p(z0) ≠ 0, existence of w with |w − z0| < ε and |p(w)| < |p(z0)|) matches the intended content for polynomials, but the missing nonconstancy renders the statement unfaithful and in fact false in general (e.g., p ≡ 1).

Other notes:
- Restricting from power series to polynomials is an acceptable specialization per the guidelines. The only serious issue is the misuse of “p ≠ 0” instead of “p is not constant”.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous definitions; the mismatch is a critical hypothesis error. Thus not faithful. A mid-low grade reflects that most of the structure is correct except for the key nonconstancy condition.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the math library; fine.
- `namespace Complex`: Opens a namespace for complex-analytic content; organizational only.
- `noncomputable def sec (z : ℂ) : ℂ := (cos z)⁻¹`: Defines the complex secant function as the multiplicative inverse of the complex cosine, i.e., sec z = 1 / cos z. This is the standard complex-analytic definition.
- `theorem abs_sec_ge_abs_sec_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (sec z) ≥ Complex.abs (sec (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`: States that for any complex number z, the complex modulus of sec z is at least the complex modulus of sec of the real part of z, viewing the real part as a complex number via coercion `(z.re : ℂ)`. The proof is omitted, which is acceptable here since we are checking translation, not proof.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sec z| ≥ |sec(Re z)|.
- The Lean theorem quantifies over `z : ℂ` and asserts `|sec z| ≥ |sec (z.re)|`, using complex absolute value on both sides. Since `sec` is defined as the complex secant, and `(z.re : ℂ)` coerces the real part into ℂ, `sec (z.re : ℂ)` coincides with the real secant of Re z embedded into ℂ, and the complex modulus equals the real absolute value in that case. Thus the formal statement matches the intended mathematical statement.

Potential technical nuances:
- The code defines `sec` as a total function via `inv`, so it assigns `0` at points where `cos z = 0`. In classical analysis, secant is undefined at such points (poles). The natural language statement does not address domain issues; Lean’s totalization is a standard formalization choice and does not constitute a vacuous or misleading placeholder. It does not alter the logical form of the inequality as a statement about all z in ℂ under this convention.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning, with only a standard formalization detail (total function at poles). No auxiliary vacuous definitions; the auxiliary definition of `sec` is correct and meaningful. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem abs_sin_le_half_exp (z : ℂ) : ‖sin z‖ ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp ‖z‖ := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, the absolute value (norm) of sin z is less than or equal to (1/2) times e to the power of the absolute value (norm) of z. Here `‖·‖` on ℂ is the usual complex modulus, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential function.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_half_exp (z : ℂ) : ‖cos z‖ ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp ‖z‖ := by sorry`
  This states: For every complex number z, the absolute value (norm) of cos z is less than or equal to (1/2) times e to the power of the absolute value (norm) of z.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language claim is exactly: For all z in C, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems assert precisely these two inequalities, using the complex norm for absolute value and the real exponential. Stating them as two separate theorems matches the two-part statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are present.
- The inequalities, constants (1/2), functions (sin, cos, exp), and absolute values match exactly.
- Minor formalization details (using `‖·‖` and `Real.exp`) are faithful to the mathematical meaning.
Therefore, the code is a faithful translation.

  Natural language: For every complex number z, the absolute value (modulus) of the complex sine satisfies |sin z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|). Here, `Complex.abs` is the modulus on ℂ (a real number), and `Real.exp` is the real exponential function applied to the real number |z|.

  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of the complex cosine satisfies |cos z| ≤ (1/2) · exp(|z|).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to prove, for all z ∈ ℂ, the two inequalities |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  This states: Let U be a subset of ℂ and assume U is open. Let f be a function from ℂ to ℂ that is complex-differentiable on U. Assume further that f is injective on all of ℂ. Then for every z in U, the complex derivative deriv f z is nonzero.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- NL statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f: U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective (on U), then f′(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean statement differences:
  - Domain of f: Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. This is a standard formalization choice and is fine.
  - Injectivity: Lean assumes `Function.Injective f`, i.e., f is injective on all of ℂ. The NL statement only requires injectivity on U (e.g., `InjOn f U` or `Function.Injective (fun z : U => f z)`). This is a stronger hypothesis than the original statement.
  - Conclusion: Matches—derivative is nonzero for all z ∈ U.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- They are not exactly the same. The Lean theorem is a strict specialization of the NL statement because it requires global injectivity rather than injectivity on U. Hence it does not faithfully translate the original statement in full generality. Everything else (holomorphicity as `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, openness of U, and the conclusion) aligns.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the only issue is the stronger injectivity assumption.

  In words: The modulus of the difference between the finite partial sum of the complex exponential series up to k = n and the complex exponential `e^z` is bounded above by `(abs z)^(n+1)/(n+1)! * exp(abs z)`.
  - `Finset.range (n+1)` is the index set {0, 1, ..., n}.
  - The summand `z ^ k / (Nat.factorial k : ℂ)` is exactly z^k divided by k! in the complex numbers (factorial cast to ℂ).
  - `Complex.exp z` is e^z.

The natural language statement asks to show for all z in C and all n in N the inequality |Σ_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! e^{|z|}. The Lean statement exactly formalizes this:
- Same domain for z (ℂ) and n (Nat).
- Same finite sum with indices 0 through n.
- Same subtraction from the complex exponential e^z.
- Same modulus on the left.
- Same bound on the right, with factorial and exponential in the reals and |z| being the complex modulus. The product form `(…)/(n+1)! * e^{|z|}` matches the intended meaning of the natural language expression.

3) Comparison and discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses mathlib.
- `theorem log_one_sub_z_bound (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry`
  States a theorem for a complex number z with |z| < 1.
- Conclusion (a conjunction of two inequalities):
  • `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ (∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ))`
    This says |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑' over n ∈ ℕ of |z|^n / n (sum in ℝ). Since the summation is over ℕ starting at 0, note that the n = 0 term is (|z|^0)/(0) = 1/0, which in Lean is defined to be 0. Thus the sum equals the intended ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n.
  • `(∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n / (n : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`
    This says the same series is bounded above by |z|/(1 − |z|).

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show that |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- Lean statement: Exactly the same content, with the series expressed as a `tsum` over ℕ (including 0) but with the 0th term equal to 0, hence effectively starting at 1. The inequalities are presented as a conjunction, which is equivalent to the chain of inequalities in the natural statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing of the sum: Lean uses ∑' over ℕ; the n=0 term is 0 (since 1/0 is defined as 0 in Lean), so it matches the sum from n=1 to ∞. This is a harmless technicality.
- The use of Complex.log (principal branch). For |z| < 1, 1 − z avoids the branch cut at (−∞, 0], so the principal log is well-defined and matches the usual analytic branch near 1. This aligns with the intended meaning of the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem precisely encodes the desired inequalities.

- Comment states the intended theorem: For z in ℂ with |z| < 1, we have |log(1 - z)| ≤ |z| / (1 - |z|).
- `theorem complex.log_abs_le_of_abs_lt_one {z : ℂ} (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem with variable `z : ℂ` and hypothesis `hz : |z| < 1`, concluding `|log(1 - z)| ≤ |z| / (1 - |z|)`. Here `Complex.abs` denotes the complex modulus (a real number), and `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm. No proof is given (`sorry`), but the statement itself is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The Lean theorem exactly matches the natural language claim: given `z ∈ ℂ` with `|z| < 1`, the inequality `|log(1 - z)| ≤ |z| / (1 - |z|)` holds. The notions used (complex modulus, complex logarithm) are the standard Mathlib ones and align with the intended meaning. There are no extra or missing hypotheses, and no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.

3) Final comparison:
The two statements are the same. The only superficial difference is the theorem name and namespace casing (`complex` vs `Complex`), which does not affect the mathematical content of the statement. No discrepancies in quantifiers, domains, or the inequality itself.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_2718 (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) {z0 c : ℂ} (hz0 : z0 ∈ U) (hval : f z0 = c) (hder : HasDerivAt f (0 : ℂ) z0) : ...` 
  This sets up: U is an open subset of ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic on U (i.e., complex differentiable on U), z0 ∈ U, f(z0) = c, and f'(z0) = 0.
- Conclusion is a disjunction:
  1) `(∀ z ∈ U, f z = c)` meaning f is the constant function equal to c on U; or
  2) `∃ m ≥ 1, ∃ V open with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, ∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, DifferentiableOn ℂ g V ∧ g z0 ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ z ∈ V, f z - c = (z - z0)^m * g z`.
  This says: there exists a positive integer m, an open neighborhood V of z0 contained in U, and a holomorphic function g on V nonvanishing at z0, such that on V we have the factorization f(z) − c = (z − z0)^m g(z).
- The docstring clarifies that this is the standard local factorization and that counting roots with multiplicity follows from it.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original: U is a domain (open and connected). The code assumes U is open but not necessarily connected. This connectedness is not used for the local factorization or counting zeros near z0, so dropping it is a harmless generalization.
- Original: f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and assumed not constant. The code takes f : ℂ → ℂ, holomorphic on U; this is a standard formalization choice. The code does not assume “not constant” but its conclusion includes the alternative “either f = c on U” or the local factorization. Since the original’s statement also presents that dichotomy (and the “not constant” assumption just forces the second case), the code is a slight generalization and still faithful.
- Original: If f(z0) = c and f′(z0) = 0, then either f ≡ c on U, or else if z0 is a zero of f − c of order m, then there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicities).
- Code: Gives the standard factorization f(z) − c = (z − z0)^m g(z) with g holomorphic and nonzero at z0 on some neighborhood V. This is equivalent to “z0 is a zero of order m,” and it implies the counting statement in the original (indeed, taking V small enough ensures no other zeros in V, and z0 contributes multiplicity m). The docstring explicitly notes this equivalence.

Final check for faithfulness:
- No vacuous/placeholder definitions: all terms are standard Mathlib ones (IsOpen, DifferentiableOn, HasDerivAt, etc.).
- The statement matches the mathematical content: it asserts the same dichotomy and provides the local factorization that underlies counting preimages with multiplicity.
- Minor differences: (i) U need not be connected; irrelevant for the local claim. (ii) The “not constant” assumption is omitted but the dichotomy explicitly includes the constant case, covering the original intent. (iii) The conclusion is phrased as factorization instead of the explicit counting statement; this is a standard and essentially equivalent formulation, as noted in the docstring.

Given these, the translation is essentially faithful, with only benign generalizations and an equivalent formulation of the key claim.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, providing complex numbers, absolute value, logarithm, and infinite sums (tsum).
- The theorem `jirilebl_ca_ca_20226 (z : ℂ) (h : Complex.abs z < 1)` states: For a complex number z with |z| < 1, we have two inequalities. The first: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (↑n + 1 : ℝ)`. This is exactly |log(1 - z)| ≤ sum over n = 0..∞ of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1), i.e., the same as ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n. The second: `(∑' (n : ℕ), (Complex.abs z)^(n + 1) / (↑n + 1 : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`. This is ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|). The conjunction `∧` returns both inequalities simultaneously.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to show: for z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean statement matches exactly: same hypothesis (|z| < 1), same two inequalities, with the sum indexed over ℕ using n+1 which is equivalent to starting at 1.
- It uses Complex.log (principal branch), which is standard and appropriate here; the original statement does not specify the branch, and in this context the principal log is the usual formalization.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Index shift: Lean uses n from ℕ with (n+1); this is equivalent to summing from 1 to ∞. No substantive difference.
- The two inequalities are stated as a conjunction rather than a chained inequality; logically equivalent.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement using standard Mathlib notions.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex` bring in the complex numbers and related facts.
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : ℂ) :` sets up the statement for complex numbers z, w.
- Left-hand side: `4 * z * ((w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I)`.
  • In ℂ, the complex conjugate is `conj w = (w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I`.
  • So the LHS is `4 * z * conj w`, i.e., `4 z \bar w`.
- Right-hand side: `ofReal (Complex.abs (z + w) ^ 2 - Complex.abs (z - w) ^ 2) + I * ofReal (Complex.abs (z + I * w) ^ 2 - Complex.abs (z - I * w) ^ 2)`.
  • `Complex.abs` is the usual modulus |·| with values in ℝ.
  • `^ 2` is squaring in ℝ.
  • `ofReal` embeds a real number into ℂ.
  • Thus the RHS is exactly `(|z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2) + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2)` viewed as a complex number (with the real part given by the first difference and imaginary part by the second difference).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: `4 z\bar{w} = |z+w|^2 - |z-w|^2 + i (|z+iw|^2 - |z-iw|^2)`.
- The Lean statement matches this precisely:
  • LHS uses `conj w` written as `(w.re : ℂ) - (w.im : ℂ) * I`.
  • RHS uses `ofReal` to coerce the real-valued squared norms into ℂ and multiplies the second difference by `I`, matching `+ i(...)`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given identity.

Final check: The two statements are the same. Any slight technicalities (use of `ofReal` and explicit real/imaginary parts of `w`) are standard coercions and expansions and do not change the mathematical content.

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib, providing definitions for complex numbers, complex sine, and complex absolute value.
- The docstring states the goal: For z ∈ ℂ, show |sin z| ≥ |sin (Re z)|.
- `theorem abs_sin_complex_ge_abs_sin_re (z : Complex) : ... := by sorry` declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number `z`.
- `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z)` denotes the complex modulus of the complex sine of `z`, i.e., |sin z|.
- `Complex.abs (Complex.sin (z.re : Complex))` takes the real part `z.re` (a real number), coerces it to a complex number `(z.re : Complex)`, applies the complex sine, and then takes the complex modulus. Since for real inputs the complex sine agrees with the real sine (embedded into ℂ), this expression matches |sin(Re z)|.
- The inequality `≥` exactly matches the statement |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statement precisely formalizes the natural language statement: for all complex `z`, `|sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|`, using standard Mathlib notions `Complex.sin`, `Complex.abs`, and `z.re` with the natural coercion.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing as per instructions.

Final check:

- `theorem abs_cos_ge_abs_cos_re (z : Complex) : ... := by sorry`: Declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number `z`. The statement is `Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos z.re)`.
  - `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus (a real number).
  - `Complex.cos z` is the complex cosine of `z`.
  - `z.re` is the real part of `z` (a real number). Coercing it into `Complex`, `Complex.cos z.re` is the complex cosine evaluated at a real input, which agrees with `Real.cos z.re` as a complex number. Taking `Complex.abs` of this equals the usual absolute value of `cos(Re z)`.
  - The theorem thus states: For all `z : ℂ`, |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |cos z| ≥ |cos (Re z)|. The Lean statement exactly matches this, universally quantifying over `z : Complex` and asserting the inequality of absolute values, interpreting both sides appropriately in ℂ.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only the theorem statement is present. The use of `Complex.cos z.re` faithfully corresponds to cos(Re z), and `Complex.abs` matches the intended absolute value/modulus in both cases.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem is the same as the natural language statement. No discrepancies in quantifiers, objects, or inequality direction. The use of complex vs real functions is consistent because `Complex.cos` on a real input coincides with the real cosine coerced to ℂ, and `Complex.abs` on such a value gives the real absolute value.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Using Mathlib and opening the Complex namespace.
- `variable (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ)`: Declares a complex-valued function on ℂ and a point z0 in ℂ.
- The theorem `holomorphic_conformal_at_iff (h : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z0) : ConformalAt (fun z => f z) z0 ↔ deriv f z0 ≠ 0` states: Assuming f is complex-differentiable at z0, f is conformal at z0 if and only if the complex derivative of f at z0 is nonzero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Suppose f : ℂ → ℂ is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f'(z0) ≠ 0.” The Lean statement assumes differentiability at z0 (a local holomorphicity assumption) and gives the equivalence at that point. The usual meaning of “f is holomorphic” (on ℂ or on a neighborhood) implies differentiability at z0, so the Lean statement is a slight generalization (weaker hypothesis) but entirely faithful to the intended result at z0.

3) Final check:
- Domain/codomain: ℂ → ℂ matches.
- Property: ConformalAt at z0 ↔ derivative at z0 ≠ 0 matches.
- Assumption: Lean requires DifferentiableAt at z0, while the natural statement assumes holomorphic (stronger). This is an acceptable slight generalization and does not change the mathematical content at the point z0.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions (`DifferentiableAt`, `ConformalAt`, `deriv`).

Suppose f : β → α satisfies the Cauchy-exponential equation f(z + w) = f(z) f(w) for all z, w, and f(0) = 1. Then for all z, f(z) ≠ 0. The proof is omitted.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For the exponential on ℂ, use e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 ≠ 0 to conclude e^z ≠ 0 for all z. Generalized: if f satisfies f(z+w) = f(z)f(w) and f(0) = 1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z.
- The Lean theorem nicely generalizes the domain from ℂ (an additive abelian group) to any additive group β, which is acceptable.
- The codomain α is any type with multiplication, zero, and one (MulZeroClass + One). This is broad enough, but there is a critical missing assumption: the argument that f z ≠ 0 relies on the fact that from f z * f (−z) = f 0 = 1, we can conclude f z ≠ 0. This implication requires that 1 ≠ 0 (i.e., α is nontrivial). Without assuming 1 ≠ 0 (or Nontrivial α or NeZero (1)), the conclusion is false: in a degenerate type where 1 = 0, the hypotheses hold vacuously (e.g., constant zero function with f 0 = 1 = 0), but the conclusion f z ≠ 0 fails.
- The natural language version explicitly uses e^0 = 1 ≠ 0. The “in other words” paraphrase omitted mentioning 1 ≠ 0, but it is logically necessary. Therefore, the Lean statement is strictly stronger than what can be deduced without assuming 1 ≠ 0, and in fact false in general.

3) Final comparison:
- Same structure: multiplicativity in the additive argument and normalization at 0 imply nonvanishing everywhere.
- Key difference: the Lean code omits the crucial hypothesis 1 ≠ 0 (or Nontrivial α). Hence the formal statement is not faithful and is in general false.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions; the only issue is the missing hypothesis. A faithful version would add `[NeZero (1 : α)]` or `[Nontrivial α]` (or an explicit `one_ne_zero : (1 : α) ≠ 0`) as an assumption.

Given this, the translation is almost correct conceptually but misses a necessary assumption, so it is not faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claims: For all z in C, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems state exactly these two inequalities, with the same constants and the same use of the complex modulus and the real exponential.

- Domain: both are over all z ∈ ℂ.
- Quantities: use of complex modulus |·| matches `Complex.abs`.
- Exponential: e^{|z|} matches `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`.
- Constants: 1/2 matches `(1 / 2 : ℝ)`.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; just two theorem statements. The presence of `sorry` affects proof, not the statement. There are no generalizations or restrictions.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex` bring in mathlib and complex number notation/lemmas.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_14036 (a b : ℂ) : ... := by sorry` states a theorem for arbitrary complex numbers `a` and `b` (no proof provided, which is acceptable for translation auditing).
- The statement: `‖a + b‖ ^ 2 = ‖a‖ ^ 2 + ‖b‖ ^ 2 + 2 * (a * (b.re - b.im * I)).re`.
  - `‖·‖` is the complex modulus (norm into ℝ), so `‖a + b‖ ^ 2` is |a+b|².
  - `‖a‖ ^ 2 + ‖b‖ ^ 2` is |a|² + |b|².
  - `(b.re - b.im * I)` represents the complex number with real part `b.re` and imaginary part `-b.im`, i.e., this is exactly `conj b`.
  - `(a * (b.re - b.im * I)).re` is `Re(a * conj b)`.
  - Therefore the RHS is `|a|² + |b|² + 2 * Re(a conj b)`.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For a,b ∈ ℂ, show |a+b|² = |a|² + |b|² + 2 Re(a \bar b).
- Lean: Exactly the same identity, with `‖·‖` for modulus and `b.re - b.im * I` in place of `\bar b`.

No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are present. The formulation is faithful; using `b.re - b.im * I` is a perfectly correct way to denote `conj b` in mathlib. The types match (both sides are real numbers). Thus the translation is legitimate and accurate.

Final check: The two math statements are the same.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `{f : ℂ → ℂ}`: f is a complex-valued function on the complex plane.
- `(hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1))`: f is holomorphic (analytic) on the open unit disk D = {z : ℂ | ‖z‖ < 1}.
- `(hmap : ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1, ‖f z‖ < 1)`: f maps the unit disk into itself, i.e., for all z in D, ‖f(z)‖ < 1.
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)`: f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖z‖`: For all z in D, ‖f(z)‖ ≤ ‖z‖.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
This matches the natural language statement of the Schwarz lemma: a holomorphic self-map of the unit disk fixing 0 satisfies |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z in the disk. The Lean formulation uses AnalyticOn on the open unit ball and an explicit hypothesis that the image remains in the open unit disk; both are standard translations of “f : D → D is holomorphic.” The conclusion uses the norm ‖·‖ on ℂ, which coincides with the absolute value. Everything is standard Mathlib, no placeholders.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean code has f defined on all of ℂ rather than just D, but only assumes analyticity and boundedness on D; this is a harmless and common formalization choice.
- The set D is represented as `Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) 1` (open unit disk), consistent with the statement.
- Absolute value vs norm is equivalent on ℂ.
No substantive differences. The translation is faithful.

The natural language asks to prove, for all z ∈ ℂ, |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems state exactly these two inequalities with standard Mathlib notation. The exponential is `Real.exp` applied to the real modulus `Complex.abs z`, and the factor is `(1/2 : ℝ)`. This matches precisely.

  • Fix an open set U in ℂ (`hU : IsOpen U`).

  • Then for every z in U, the complex derivative `deriv f z` is nonzero (`∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: If U ⊆ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective (on U), then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean statement: Requires f : ℂ → ℂ (globally defined), holomorphic on U, and injective on all of ℂ; concludes nonvanishing derivative at all z ∈ U.
- The mathematical content matches, except the Lean code assumes the stronger hypothesis of global injectivity instead of injectivity restricted to U (i.e., `Injective f` rather than `InjOn f U` or `f : U → ℂ` injective). The conclusion and other hypotheses (openness of U, holomorphic on U) align correctly. The derivative notion `deriv f z` for z ∈ U matches the complex derivative.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean theorem is a specialization of the natural language statement (stronger injectivity assumption), not a generalization. No vacuous definitions or placeholders are used; all terms are standard Mathlib. The formulation is essentially the same mathematically, with only a mild strengthening of hypotheses.

Given the slight but clear strengthening (global injectivity instead of injectivity on U), this is very close and acceptable as a faithful formalization, though not word-for-word identical.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Brings in mathlib and opens the Complex namespace; no mathematical content beyond setup.
- Docstring: States the well-known identity |sin z|^2 = sin^2 x + sinh^2 y for z = x + i y, deducing |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|, and then concludes the reciprocal inequality for cosecants: |csc z| ≤ |csc(Re z)|.
- The theorem `csc_abs_le_of_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (1 / sin z) ≤ Complex.abs (1 / sin (z.re : ℂ))`: This asserts that for all complex z, |1/sin z| ≤ |1/sin(Re z)|, i.e., |csc z| ≤ |csc(Re z)|. There is no additional hypothesis; it’s a global inequality (with Lean’s convention that 1/0 = 0 in a field).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement asks to prove: For z ∈ ℂ, |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|. That is the opposite inequality direction compared to the Lean theorem.
- The Lean code explicitly claims |csc z| ≤ |csc(Re z)| (and its docstring matches this ≤ direction), while the natural statement claims ≥.

3) Final check (are the math problems the same?):
- They are not the same; the inequalities are reversed. The code proves (or states) the opposite of what the natural language statement asks. Additionally, the code uses 1/sin everywhere (which in Lean is defined even at zeros via inv 0 = 0), whereas the mathematical “csc” is usually taken as the reciprocal on the domain where sin ≠ 0. This domain subtlety is minor here relative to the main issue, which is the reversed inequality.

- `Complex.abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => z ^ k / (Nat.factorial k : Complex) - Complex.exp z) ≤ ...` states the absolute value of a certain sum is bounded. The sum is over k from 0 to n (since `Finset.range (n+1)`), and the summand is `(z^k / k!) - exp z`. So the left side is |sum_{k=0}^n (z^k/k! - e^z)|, which equals |(sum_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) - (n+1) e^z|.
- The right-hand side is `(Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.factorial (n+1) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`, i.e., (|z|^{n+1} / (n+1)!) * e^{|z|}. This matches the intended RHS.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The intended statement is |(sum_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) - e^z| ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.
- The code instead has |sum_{k=0}^n (z^k/k! - e^z)| on the left, which equals |(sum_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) - (n+1) e^z|, not |(sum_{k=0}^n z^k/k!) - e^z|. The placement of `- Complex.exp z` inside the sum is the error; it should be outside the sum.
- Aside from this, the indexing, complex/real exponentials, and factorial coercions are appropriate and consistent with the intended statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean statement differs by a factor of (n+1) in the term subtracted from the series partial sum. This is a substantive change and not a mere technicality.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, providing complex analysis definitions like `Complex.exp`, `Complex.cosh`, and `Complex.sinh`.
- `theorem cosh_eq_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.cosh z = (Complex.exp z + Complex.exp (-z)) / (2 : ℂ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, cosh(z) equals (e^z + e^{-z})/2. This is exactly the standard definition/formula for the complex hyperbolic cosine.
- `theorem sinh_eq_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.sinh z = (Complex.exp z - Complex.exp (-z)) / (2 : ℂ) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, sinh(z) equals (e^z − e^{-z})/2. This is exactly the standard definition/formula for the complex hyperbolic sine.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The Lean statements match the natural language statement precisely: both are universally quantified over z in ℂ and assert the two identities for cosh and sinh in terms of exp. The usage of `Complex.exp (-z)` corresponds to e^{−z}, and division by `(2 : ℂ)` matches division by 2 in ℂ.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; just two theorem statements with omitted proofs (`sorry`). This is acceptable per the instructions since we only judge translation of the statement, not the proof.
- The content is neither a generalization nor a specialization; it is exactly the same as the natural language statement.

Final check: The two math problems are the same. No discrepancies found.

- `import Mathlib`: imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem complex_abs_cos_le_cosh_im (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ Real.cosh z.im := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem named `complex_abs_cos_le_cosh_im` stating: for any complex number `z`, the complex absolute value of `cos z` is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic cosine of the imaginary part of `z`.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the mathematical library with complex numbers, exponential, argument, modulus, etc.
- `theorem arg_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.arg (Complex.exp z) = z.im := by sorry` states: For any complex number z, the principal argument (Complex.arg) of e^z equals the imaginary part of z. Here `Complex.exp z` denotes e^z, `Complex.arg` is the principal argument, and `z.im` is Im z.
- `theorem abs_exp (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.exp z) = Real.exp z.re := by sorry` states: For any complex number z, the absolute value (modulus) of e^z equals e^{Re z}. Here `Complex.abs` is |·| on ℂ and `Real.exp z.re` is e^{Re z}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language asks to show Arg(e^z) = Im z and |e^z| = e^{Re z} for z ∈ ℂ. The Lean statements exactly mirror these: same domain (all z ∈ ℂ), same expressions, with Arg realized as the principal argument `Complex.arg`, |·| as `Complex.abs`, and the exponential as `Complex.exp` / `Real.exp`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only nuance is that Arg in informal math can be ambiguous, but it typically denotes the principal argument, which is exactly `Complex.arg` in Mathlib. Since e^z ≠ 0 for all z, using principal argument is perfectly appropriate and matches the usual meaning.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorems are stated (with `sorry` proofs, which is acceptable for judging translation). The second statement matches precisely.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show, for z ∈ ℂ, that e^{\overline{z}} = \overline{e^z}, sin(\overline{z}) = \overline{\sin z}, and cos(\overline{z}) = \overline{\cos z}.
- In Lean, `(starRingEnd ℂ)` is exactly complex conjugation, and `Complex.exp`, `Complex.sin`, `Complex.cos` are the complex exponential, sine, and cosine. So each theorem precisely matches the corresponding identity.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extra hypotheses or restrictions are introduced. The domain is ℂ as in the statement. The use of `(starRingEnd ℂ)` is a standard formalization of complex conjugation.

  States a theorem for a complex number `z` with the hypothesis `|z| < 1`.
- The conclusion is a conjunction `A ∧ B` where:
  A: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (n+1 : ℝ)`
     This says `|log(1 - z)| ≤ ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^(n+1)/(n+1)`. Since the sum over `n : ℕ` starting at 0 with term indexed by `n+1` is exactly the sum from 1 to ∞, this is `|log(1 - z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n`.
  B: `∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (n+1 : ℝ) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For `z ∈ ℂ` with `|z| < 1`, show the double inequality `|log(1 - z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|)`.
- The Lean statement matches exactly: same hypothesis `|z| < 1`, same series (via reindexing `n → n+1`), same two inequalities. The Lean presents the chain as a conjunction of the two inequalities, which is logically equivalent.
- `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm; in typical contexts “log” on ℂ refers to the principal log, so this is an acceptable and standard formalization.
- The sum is over real numbers (since `Complex.abs z : ℝ`), matching the intended real-valued series.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with `sorry` proof placeholder, which is fine for translation auditing.

3) Final check: The math problems are the same. Indexing matches (n+1 over ℕ equals sum from n=1), both inequalities appear, and the objects (absolute value, principal log, real series) are correctly represented. No discrepancies found.

- `theorem abs_sinh_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. Here Complex.abs denotes the complex modulus |·| and Real.exp denotes the real exponential function e^{·} applied to the real number |z|.
- `theorem abs_cosh_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cosh z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the original statement
- The natural language statement asks to prove two inequalities for every z ∈ ℂ: |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- The Lean code states exactly these two theorems, each universally quantified over z : Complex, using the standard Mathlib notions for sinh, cosh, absolute value (modulus), and the real exponential.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only the statements are given (with proofs omitted via `sorry`). This matches the instruction that the user asked only for a translation.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Quantification: Both the natural language and Lean state the inequalities for arbitrary z ∈ ℂ.
- Functions and notation: Lean’s `Complex.abs` and `Real.exp` correctly represent |z| and e^{|z|} respectively.
- Constants: `(1 / 2 : ℝ)` corresponds to 1/2.
- Both inequalities (for sinh and cosh) are present.
- Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language statement. There are no discrepancies between the original statement and the code’s theorems.

Note: While the mathematical truth of the cosh inequality as stated is questionable (e.g., at z = 0 the inequality |cosh 0| ≤ 1/2 e^{|0|} becomes 1 ≤ 1/2, which is false), this audit concerns faithfulness of translation, and the Lean code precisely matches the given natural language claims.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem schwarz_lemma {f : ℂ → ℂ} ... : Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1 := ...`
  States a theorem about a function f: ℂ → ℂ, concluding |f'(0)| ≤ 1.
- Hypothesis `hmap : ∀ z, Complex.abs z < 1 → Complex.abs (f z) < 1` says: for every z with |z| < 1 (i.e., z in the open unit disk), we have |f z| < 1. This encodes that f maps the open unit disk into itself.
- Hypothesis `h0 : f 0 = 0` says f(0) = 0.
- Hypothesis `hd : DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0` says f is complex differentiable at 0 (only at the point 0).
- Conclusion: `Complex.abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1` gives |f'(0)| ≤ 1.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Suppose f: 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1.” This requires that f is holomorphic on the unit disk (i.e., complex differentiable on an open set containing the unit disk). The Lean code assumes only differentiability at 0, not holomorphicity (or even differentiability) on the whole disk. The mapping property is correctly captured by `hmap`. The condition f(0)=0 matches `h0`. However, the crucial holomorphic-on-𝔻 hypothesis is missing and is replaced by the much weaker `DifferentiableAt ℂ f 0`.

3) Final comparison:
- Domain/codomain: Both treat f as a function on ℂ with the property that it maps the unit disk into itself; acceptable.
- Fixed point: f(0)=0 matches.
- Regularity: Natural language requires holomorphic on 𝔻 (i.e., complex differentiable on the disk), whereas the Lean theorem assumes only complex differentiability at 0. This is a significant weakening and makes the statement not equivalent; in fact, the weaker version is false in general.
- Conclusion: |f'(0)| ≤ 1 matches.

Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation: it omits the essential holomorphic-on-𝔻 hypothesis and replaces it with merely differentiable at 0.

- `Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' n : ℕ, z^(n+1) / (n+1) := by sorry`: The claimed equality is that the complex logarithm of (1 - z) equals the negative of the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ of z^(n+1) divided by (n+1). The `∑'` denotes the (possibly infinite) sum (tsum) over n from 0 to ∞. Since the index is n+1, this is exactly the same as −∑_{m=1}^∞ z^m/m after the index shift m = n+1. No auxiliary definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove log(1 − z) = −∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n.
- Lean: For z : Complex with Complex.abs z < 1, conclude Complex.log (1 − z) = −∑' n : ℕ, z^(n+1)/(n+1).
These are equivalent statements; the only difference is the indexing shift in the series, which is standard and yields the same sum. The Lean `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm, which is the usual interpretation in such statements, and the domain |z| < 1 ensures the identity holds in that disc.

3) Final check for differences:
- Indexing: Lean uses n from 0 with term z^(n+1)/(n+1) instead of the natural language n from 1 with z^n/n. These are exactly the same via index shift.
- Absolute value: `Complex.abs` matches |z|.
- Logarithm: `Complex.log` corresponds to the intended complex logarithm (principal branch), consistent with the standard identity in the unit disc.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are present. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is allowed per the instructions.

- `theorem det_of_complex_rep (ξ ζ : ℂ) : (ξ.re + ζ.re) * (ξ.re - ζ.re) - (-ξ.im + ζ.im) * (ξ.im + ζ.im) = Complex.normSq ξ - Complex.normSq ζ := by sorry`
  This states: for complex numbers ξ and ζ, the real-number identity
  (Re ξ + Re ζ)(Re ξ − Re ζ) − (−Im ξ + Im ζ)(Im ξ + Im ζ) = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2
  holds (where Complex.normSq w = (Re w)^2 + (Im w)^2 = |w|^2). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement: If a 2×2 real matrix M is the real-linear matrix of the map z ↦ ξ z + ζ z̄ on ℂ ≅ ℝ^2 (with the standard basis 1, i), then det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- Compute the real matrix of T(z) = ξ z + ζ z̄ with ξ = a+ib, ζ = c+id:
  T(1) = ξ + ζ = (a+c) + i(b+d) gives first column (a+c, b+d).
  T(i) = ξ i + ζ (−i) = (−b + d) + i(a − c) gives second column (−b + d, a − c).
  Hence det M = (a+c)(a−c) − (−b + d)(b + d).
- The Lean theorem’s LHS is exactly this determinant expression and its RHS is Complex.normSq ξ − Complex.normSq ζ = (a^2+b^2) − (c^2+d^2) = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- Therefore the theorem statement is precisely the desired determinant identity, expressed purely as an algebraic equality of components.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code does not explicitly name the matrix or the determinant operator, but the LHS is exactly the determinant of the matrix representing z ↦ ξ z + ζ z̄ in the standard identification ℂ ≅ ℝ^2. The RHS is |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2 using Complex.normSq. No auxiliary fake definitions. This is an essentially identical translation of the statement.
- Minor note: the proof is omitted (`sorry`), but we are assessing the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof. No vacuous definitions are used.

Conclusion: Faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem injective_holomorphic_deriv_ne_zero {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (hinj : Function.Injective f) : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ (0 : ℂ)`
  Natural language: Let U be an open subset of ℂ. Let f: ℂ → ℂ be a function that is complex differentiable on U. Assume f is injective on all of ℂ. Then for every z ∈ U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; all terms come from Mathlib: `IsOpen`, `DifferentiableOn ℂ`, `Function.Injective`, and `deriv`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original statement: U ⊆ ℂ is open, f: U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective (on U), and conclude f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean statement differences:
  - Domain of f: Lean uses f: ℂ → ℂ, not f: U → ℂ. This is a common formalization choice when paired with DifferentiableOn on U.
  - Injectivity: Lean requires global injectivity `Function.Injective f` (on all ℂ), whereas the original requires injectivity only on U. The mathematically appropriate hypothesis would be `InjectiveOn f U` (or to take f: U → ℂ injective). Thus the Lean theorem assumes a strictly stronger hypothesis than the original statement.
  - Holomorphic: Lean models “holomorphic on U” as `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, which is standard and faithful.
  - Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0` matches “f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U”. With U open and `DifferentiableOn` on U, using `deriv f z` (rather than a within-derivative) is appropriate.

3) Final comparison:
- The only substantive mismatch is the injectivity hypothesis: global injectivity vs injectivity restricted to U. This is a stricter assumption and therefore a specialization of the original statement. Everything else aligns well: open set U, holomorphic/differentiable on U, and the intended nonvanishing derivative conclusion on U.
- Since the theorem assumes more than necessary, it is not a fully faithful translation, though it is very close and in the right formalization style. There are no vacuous definitions, and the mathematical notions are legitimate Mathlib constructs.

Overall: Near pass; not fully faithful due to global injectivity instead of injectivity on U.

- `theorem identity_theorem {U S : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hS : S ⊆ U)` introduces sets U and S in ℂ, assumes U is open and S ⊆ U.
- `{f g : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U) (hg : AnalyticOn ℂ g U)` introduces functions f, g from ℂ to ℂ which are analytic (holomorphic) on U.

- `: ∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z` is the conclusion that f equals g on all of U.

- f, g holomorphic on U: captured by `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` and `AnalyticOn ℂ g U` (holomorphic = complex-analytic in Mathlib).
- S ⊆ U: captured explicitly.
- S has an accumulation point in U: captured by `∃ z0 ∈ U, z0 ∈ closure (S \ {z0})`, which is the standard topological formulation of “accumulation point in U”.
- If f = g on S then f ≡ g on U: conclusion `∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z`.

3) Final comparison and possible discrepancies:
- The only technical deviation is that f and g are defined on all of ℂ rather than on U, with analyticity restricted to U via `AnalyticOn`. This is a standard and faithful formalization in Mathlib.
- The accumulation point is expressed correctly using the closure of `S \ {z0}`.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `example (z : ℂ) (hz : 1 + z ^ 2 ≠ 0) : HasDerivAt Complex.arctan (1 / (1 + z ^ 2)) z := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z with 1 + z^2 ≠ 0, the complex arctangent has derivative 1/(1 + z^2) at z. This matches the standard complex derivative formula for arctan, with the correct exclusion of the poles at z = ±i (where 1 + z^2 = 0).

- `example (z : ℂ) (hz : z ≠ 0) : HasDerivAt Complex.log (1 / z) z := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z ≠ 0, the (principal) complex logarithm has derivative 1/z at z. This claims differentiability of Complex.log at every nonzero z.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that arctan' z = 1/(1+z^2) and log'(z) = 1/z where defined.” The phrase “where defined” is essential in complex analysis: the principal branch of log is holomorphic on ℂ \ (-∞, 0], not on all of ℂ \ {0}. So the derivative formula for Complex.log holds on ℂ \ (-∞, 0], i.e., away from the branch cut, not merely at z ≠ 0.
- The first Lean statement for arctan is faithful: it includes the necessary condition 1 + z^2 ≠ 0, matching “where defined.”
- The second Lean statement for log is too strong: it assumes only z ≠ 0, which includes points on the negative real axis where the principal Complex.log is not even continuous and hence not complex differentiable. Therefore, the Lean code overstates the domain compared to “where defined.” A faithful Lean translation should restrict to the domain of the principal log (exclude the negative real axis) or formulate the statement about an arbitrary local branch of log around z.

3) Final comparison:
- Arctan part: same as the natural statement where defined. Good.
- Log part: different; the code claims differentiability at all z ≠ 0, while “where defined” for Complex.log should exclude the negative real axis as well. Hence the overall translation is not fully faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement asks to prove, for z ∈ ℂ, the two inequalities |sinh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean code states exactly these two inequalities with the same quantification (for all z : ℂ), the same functions (sinh, cosh), the same absolute value (Complex.abs), and the same right-hand side (1/2 times Real.exp of the modulus). No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorems are straightforward formulations.

3) Final check (same or different?):
They are the same: both versions assert the two inequalities for all complex z, using modulus and the real exponential. No discrepancies in constants, domains, or functions. Although the proofs are omitted (`sorry`), our task is only to check translation. Hence, the translation is faithful.

- Conclusion: `∀ z0 ∈ U, deriv f z0 = 0 → ∃ r > 0, ∀ z ∈ U, dist z z0 < r → (deriv f z = 0 → z = z0)`
  - For every point z0 in U with f'(z0) = 0, there exists a radius r > 0 such that for any z in U with |z − z0| < r, if f'(z) = 0 then z = z0. In other words, each critical point of f in U is isolated relative to U.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f not constant. Show the set {z ∈ U : f'(z) = 0} is discrete in U.
- Lean formalization:

- Discreteness: The metric-ball formulation over points z ∈ U is exactly “discrete in U.”

- The explicit HasDerivAt f f' p and f' ≠ 0 precisely encode “f'(p) ≠ 0”. It’s slightly redundant given differentiability on U, but faithful.
- The conclusion includes V ⊆ U, which matches the intended context (since f is defined/holomorphic on U). Saying V is a neighborhood of p within U is standard.

- `{U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U)`: U is an open subset of the complex plane.
- `(f : ℂ → ℂ)`: f is a function from ℂ to ℂ (globally defined on ℂ).
- `(hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U)`: f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ open; f: U → ℂ holomorphic; if |f| attains a local maximum at z0 ∈ U (understood relative to U, since f is only defined on U), then f is constant in a neighborhood of z0 (typically a neighborhood contained in U).
- Lean: Assumes f is defined on all of ℂ, differentiable on U, and requires a local maximum of |f| at z0 in the ambient topology of ℂ (not just relative to U). Concludes f is constant on some open neighborhood in ℂ (no requirement that the neighborhood lies within U).

3) Are the two statements the same?
- Differences:
  - Hypothesis on local maximum: The Lean code uses IsLocalMax in ℂ, which is stronger than the natural language condition (local maximum relative to U). The natural statement would be more faithfully captured by IsLocalMaxOn (fun z => ‖f z‖) U z0 (or equivalently a local max with respect to the within-U filter 𝓝[U] z0).
  - Conclusion: The Lean statement does not require the neighborhood V to be contained in U, whereas in the natural-language context (where f: U → ℂ), “constant in a neighborhood of z0” is typically interpreted as a neighborhood contained in U. The Lean version is weaker in form (it only asserts existence of some open neighborhood in ℂ) but is compatible with choosing V ⊆ U in typical proofs; nonetheless, as a formal translation it omits V ⊆ U.
  - Domain: f is ℂ → ℂ in Lean versus U → ℂ in the text. This is standard in formalization (since only differentiability on U is used), so it’s acceptable.

Overall: The code states a slightly stronger hypothesis (ambient local maximum) and a slightly weaker form of the conclusion (does not assert V ⊆ U). This is not a perfectly faithful translation, though it is very close in spirit and would usually imply the intended result. Therefore, it is a near pass rather than fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- Context: U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. f : ℂ → ℂ is given with hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U (i.e., f is holomorphic on U). z0, c : ℂ with hz0 : z0 ∈ U, hfv : f z0 = c, and hder : HasDerivAt f 0 z0 (the complex derivative of f at z0 equals 0).
- Conclusion: Either (∀ z ∈ U, f z = c), meaning f is the constant function c on U, or there exist:
  - m : ℕ with hm : 1 ≤ m,
  - V : Set ℂ with hV : IsOpen V and hz0V : z0 ∈ V,
  - g : ℂ → ℂ with hg : DifferentiableOn ℂ g V,
  such that (∀ z ∈ V, f z = c + (z - z0)^m * g z) and g z0 ≠ 0.
This expresses the standard local factorization: near z0, f(z) − c = (z − z0)^m g(z) with g holomorphic and nonvanishing at z0.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ is a domain (open and connected). f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant. If f(z0)=c and f'(z0)=0, then either f ≡ c or else z0 is a zero of f−c of order m and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity).
- Agreement:
  - Holomorphic on U ↔ DifferentiableOn ℂ f U.
  - f'(z0)=0 ↔ HasDerivAt f 0 z0.
  - The disjunction allows the constant case f ≡ c on U.
  - “z0 is a zero of f − c of order m” is captured by the factorization f z = c + (z − z0)^m g z with g holomorphic on V and g z0 ≠ 0.
- Differences:
  - Domain vs open: the code assumes U is open but not connected. For this local statement, connectedness is not needed, so this is a benign weakening.
  - Nonconstant: the code does not assume nonconstancy; instead it includes the constant case in the conclusion. This is a harmless generalization.
  - V ⊆ U is not stated. Typically one can and would take V ⊆ U; since the statement is existential, this omission is not harmful (we can choose such a V). Still, the code asserts the identity on all z ∈ V, not just z ∈ V ∩ U, but that is compatible since we can pick V ⊆ U.
  - Most importantly, the natural statement explicitly includes the counting conclusion: f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity). The Lean theorem does not state this counting property; it only gives the factorization from which the counting follows as a corollary. The docstring mentions this “in particular” consequence, but it is not part of the formal theorem statement.

Step 3: Final check.
- The core local-structure/zero-of-order-m part is faithfully captured by the Lean statement.
- However, the natural statement includes an explicit assertion about the number of preimages counted with multiplicity, which is not present in the Lean theorem statement. While it follows from the provided factorization, it is not formally stated.
- Other differences (domain vs open, nonconstant hypothesis, V ⊆ U) are minor and acceptable as standard generalizations/omissions for a local result.

Conclusion: Very close and essentially the same local theorem, but missing the explicit counting conclusion in the formal statement. Hence not fully faithful.

    - Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U — the ball is contained in U.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, p ∈ U, f'(p) ≠ 0. Then for sufficiently small δ > 0, the restriction of f to the open disk Δ_δ(p) is injective.
- The Lean statement matches this precisely:
  - Uses DifferentiableOn ℂ f U to represent f being holomorphic on U.
  - Assumes p ∈ U and deriv f p ≠ 0 corresponding to f'(p) ≠ 0.
  - Concludes existence of δ > 0 such that f is injective on Metric.ball p δ (the open disk) and moreover that this ball is contained in U, making “f restricted to Δ_δ(p)” well-defined. The injectivity is expressed by the pointwise condition ∀ z w ∈ ball, f z = f w → z = w.

3) Final check of equivalence and potential discrepancies:
- Domain of f: The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ instead of f : U → ℂ, but compensates by assuming DifferentiableOn on U and by concluding Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U, so injectivity is asserted exactly on a subset of U. This is a standard and faithful formalization.
- Notation: Metric.ball p δ corresponds to the open disk Δ_δ(p). δ > 0 is explicitly required.
- Derivative: deriv f p ≠ 0 corresponds to f'(p) ≠ 0. Given hU and hf, this is consistent with the usual holomorphic derivative at p.
- There are no vacuous or fake definitions; the statement is a direct formalization of the claim.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `complex_local_inverse_holomorphic` is stated for `U : Set ℂ`, a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, and a point `p : ℂ`.
- Hypotheses:
  - `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`: f is holomorphic (complex differentiable) on U.
  - `hp : p ∈ U`: p is in U.
  - `hder : deriv f p ≠ 0`: the complex derivative of f at p is nonzero.
- Conclusion: There exist sets `V, W : Set ℂ` such that:
  - `IsOpen V` and `IsOpen W`: V and W are open (so they are neighborhoods when they contain the respective points).
  - `p ∈ V` and `f p ∈ W`: V is a neighborhood of p and W is a neighborhood of f(p).
  - `Set.MapsTo f V W`: f maps V into W.
  - `Set.InjOn f V` and `Set.SurjOn f V W`: f restricted to V is injective and surjective onto W, hence a bijection V → W.
  - There exists `g : ℂ → ℂ` such that:
    - `DifferentiableOn ℂ g W`: g is holomorphic on W.
    - `Set.MapsTo g W V`: g maps W into V.
    - `(∀ z ∈ V, g (f z) = z)` and `(∀ x ∈ W, f (g x) = x)`: g is a two-sided inverse of f between V and W.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exist neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p) such that f : V → W is a bijection and f^{-1} is holomorphic.
- The code captures:
  - Openness of U, holomorphicity of f on U, p ∈ U, and nonzero derivative at p.
  - Existence of open neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p).
  - f is a bijection V → W and its inverse g is holomorphic on W.
- Key discrepancy:
  - The code has `f : ℂ → ℂ` and does not require `V ⊆ U`. In the natural statement, since f is a map `U → ℂ`, the phrase “f : V → W is a bijection” implicitly means the restriction `V ⊆ U`. This inclusion is essential for faithfulness to the stated domain. The Lean code omits `V ⊆ U`, allowing potentially V that is not contained in U.
  - Everything else matches: neighborhoods are open, bijection is encoded via `InjOn` and `SurjOn`, and the inverse is holomorphic via `DifferentiableOn ℂ g W` with two-sided inverse equations.

Final comparison:
- The only substantive mismatch is the missing constraint `V ⊆ U`. Since the Lean version takes f to be globally defined on ℂ and does not insist that the local inverse lies within U, the statement is a slight weakening/generalization relative to the original phrasing. There are no vacuous placeholders; all notions are standard Mathlib concepts.
- Therefore, it is very close but not fully faithful to the domain restriction in the original statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem exists_lifted_arg_of_simple_closed_curve is stated for real numbers a, b and a curve γ : ℝ → ℂ.
- Assumptions:
  - hcont : ContinuousOn γ (Icc a b). This encodes that γ is continuous on the interval [a, b].
  - hclosed : γ a = γ b. This encodes that the curve is closed (endpoints agree).
  - hinj : Set.InjOn γ (Icc a b \ {a, b}). This encodes simplicity: γ is injective on [a, b] except possibly at the endpoints (which coincide), i.e., a standard formalization of a simple closed curve.
  - hnonzero : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, γ t ≠ 0. The curve avoids the origin.
  - θ : ℝ → ℝ with hθ : ContinuousOn θ (Icc a b). A continuous real function defined on [a, b] (though declared on ℝ, only used on [a,b]).
  - heq : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, exp(i θ(t)) = γ(t) / |γ(t)|. This encodes the polar-angle relation e^{i θ(t)} = γ(t)/|γ(t)| on [a, b].
  - origin_inside : Prop. An arbitrary proposition, intended to represent “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ”. However, it is not defined or connected to γ; it is just an unconstrained parameter.
- Conclusion: ∃ θtilde : ℝ → ℝ such that
  - θtilde is continuous on Icc a b,
  - exp(i θtilde(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)| for all t ∈ [a,b],
  - θtilde(a) = θ(a),
  - and θtilde(b) = θtilde(a) + 2π ↔ origin_inside.

Assessment vs. the natural language statement:
- The code captures many structural aspects: closed simple curve, avoidance of the origin, existence of a continuous lift θ̃ matching the argument of γ, and the endpoint condition θ̃(a)=θ(a). It also asserts the “2π jump iff …” form.
- The major issue: origin_inside is an arbitrary Prop, not a defined statement tying to γ (e.g., “0 lies in the Jordan interior of γ”). As written, the theorem claims the existence of θ̃ making an arbitrary proposition equivalent to the 2π endpoint jump, which is not the intended meaning and is vastly stronger/wrong. This is a critical unfaithfulness.
- Other differences:
  - Piecewise smoothness is not assumed; the code assumes continuity instead. This is a benign generalization (piecewise smooth ⇒ continuous). Acceptable per guidelines.
  - The domain is ℝ with properties only on Icc a b; this matches the [a,b] setup.
  - Simplicity and closedness are encoded as hclosed and injectivity on Icc \ {a,b}, which is a standard formalization.

Final check:
- The intended theorem’s “iff the origin is inside the region bounded by γ” is not formalized; instead, a free variable origin_inside : Prop is used. This makes the statement unfaithful to the original.
- No vacuous definitions are introduced, but the crucial geometric predicate is missing and replaced by an unconstrained placeholder, which is effectively vacuous with respect to the curve.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because the key geometric condition is not defined and is treated as an arbitrary proposition. If origin_inside were properly defined (e.g., using the Jordan curve interior or winding number ≠ 0), the rest of the statement would be a reasonable formalization. Therefore, it earns a mid-level grade for having the right shape but failing the crucial equivalence.

- Natural language: U ⊂ ℂ open, f: U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p such that f(V) is open and f|_V is injective.
- Lean: Models “f: U → ℂ holomorphic” as a globally defined f: ℂ → ℂ with `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U` (standard in mathlib). The derivative `deriv f p` is the usual complex derivative at p; since U is open and p ∈ U, this matches the derivative of f as a map on U.
- Conclusion: Existence of an open V containing p with f(V) open and f injective on V matches “f|_V is injective.”

3) Differences:
- The Lean statement does not explicitly require V ⊆ U. In the natural language, since f: U → ℂ, the restriction f|_V only makes sense if V ⊆ U. In Lean, f is defined on all of ℂ, so the restriction to V always makes sense, and one can choose V ⊆ U to satisfy the conclusion. This is a mild generalization in the formalization style and does not change the essence of the statement; the existence claim remains valid and faithful.
- All auxiliary notions (`IsOpen`, `DifferentiableOn`, `deriv`) are genuine mathlib concepts; no vacuous placeholders are used.

Overall, the code is a faithful formalization with a standard slight generalization (global function with DifferentiableOn and no explicit V ⊆ U), which is acceptable.

- Natural language: Let U ⊂ ℂ be open and f: U → ℂ be holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f is an open mapping.
- Lean formalization: Assumes U is open; f is holomorphic on U and nonconstant on U; concludes the restricted map U → ℂ is an open map.

- The second part matches the local injectivity claim: at any p with f'(p) ≠ 0, f is locally injective. The Lean statement provides an open neighborhood V of p on which f is injective. Although it doesn’t explicitly assert V ⊆ U, since U is open and p ∈ U, one can intersect V with U to get an open neighborhood within U with the same injectivity property. Thus it is effectively equivalent to the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain modeling: Lean uses f : ℂ → ℂ together with DifferentiableOn ℂ f U, which is the standard mathlib approach to “holomorphic on U” for f restricted to U. This is a faithful formalization of f : U → ℂ holomorphic.
- Non-constancy: Encoded as ¬∃ c, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c, which is the usual definition of “nonconstant on U.”
- Local injectivity neighborhood: Lean produces V open in ℂ containing p (not necessarily V ⊆ U). This is not an issue: taking V ∩ U yields an open neighborhood in U on which f is injective. Hence no substantive discrepancy.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard mathlib notions. The proofs are omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language theorem.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- imports/open: Using Mathlib, Metric, Set; irrelevant to the math content.

- Theorem zeros_of_analytic_are_isolated:
  Hypotheses: U ⊆ ℂ is open (hU), f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic on U (hf), c ∈ ℂ.
  Statement: For every z ∈ U, if f z = c, then there exists δ > 0 such that the open ball B(z, δ) intersects the set {w | w ∈ U and f w = c} exactly in the singleton {z}.
  Natural language: Each solution z to f(z) = c inside U is isolated; i.e., the set {z ∈ U : f(z) = c} is a discrete subset (in the ambient ℂ topology).

- Theorem analytic_local_factorization:
  Hypotheses: U open, f analytic on U, p ∈ U, and f(p) = c.
  Conclusion: There exist a natural number k, a radius δ > 0, and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that g is analytic on the ball B(p, δ), and for all z ∈ B(p, δ), f(z) − c = (z − p)^k * g(z), and moreover g(p) ≠ 0.
  Natural language: Near p, f(z) − c factors as (z − p)^k times an analytic function g that does not vanish at p; hence g is not identically zero.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- First part: “{z ∈ U : f(z) = c} is a discrete set.” The Lean theorem expresses exactly the defining property of discreteness: for each z in the set, there is a neighborhood whose intersection with the set is {z}. The intersection is taken with U explicitly, matching the set {z ∈ U : f(z) = c}. This is faithful.

- Second part: “If p ∈ U and f(p) = c, then there exists δ > 0 and a holomorphic g on Δ_δ(p) with f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z) for all z in Δ_δ(p), and g(p) ≠ 0; also g is not identically zero.” The Lean theorem provides k ∈ ℕ, δ > 0, and g analytic on the ball B(p, δ), with the factorization holding for all z in that ball and g(p) ≠ 0. Since g(p) ≠ 0 implies g is not identically zero, the “not identically zero” clause is satisfied. The statement in Lean does not explicitly state B(p, δ) ⊆ U, but since f is defined on all of ℂ and analytic on U, we can choose δ small enough so that B(p, δ) ⊆ U; the existential quantifier allows that choice. Thus the content matches the intended local factorization in the disc contained in U.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Modeling choice: Lean takes f : ℂ → ℂ analytic on U rather than f : U → ℂ; this is a standard formalization trick and does not alter the meaning since all local statements are confined to neighborhoods around points in U.
- Discreteness: The theorem asserts the exact singleton intersection property, which is the discrete-set condition.
- Factorization: All required properties (existence of k, δ, g analytic on the disc, factorization on the disc, and g(p) ≠ 0) are present. The “g not identically zero” clause is implied by g(p) ≠ 0.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language claims with standard formalization choices and no vacuous placeholders.

Then z0 is a zero of f' of some finite order.

The statement below formalises this by producing a radius r>0 and an integer n ≥ 0 and an analytic function g
on the ball of radius r around z0 with g(z0) ≠ 0 such that on that ball we have
  deriv f z = (z - z0)^n * g z.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `lemma deriv_zero_has_finite_order (U : Set ℂ) {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ}` introduces an open set U in ℂ, a function f: ℂ → ℂ, and a point z0 ∈ ℂ.
- Hypotheses:
  - `(hU : IsOpen U)`: U is open.
  - `(hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f U)`: f is holomorphic (analytic) on U.
  - `(hz0 : z0 ∈ U)`: z0 is in U.
  - `(h_nonconst : ¬ ∀ z ∈ U, f z = f z0)`: f is not the constant function with value f(z0) on U (i.e., f is not constant on U).
  - `(hder0 : deriv f z0 = 0)`: the derivative of f at z0 is 0.
- Conclusion:
  - `∃ (n : ℕ) (r : ℝ) (g : ℂ → ℂ), ...`: there exist a natural number n, a radius r > 0, and a function g: ℂ → ℂ such that:
    - `0 < r`: positive radius.
    - `ball z0 r ⊆ U`: the ball around z0 of radius r is contained in U.
    - `AnalyticOn ℂ g (ball z0 r)`: g is holomorphic on that ball.
    - `g z0 ≠ 0`: g does not vanish at z0.
    - `∀ z ∈ ball z0 r, deriv f z = (z - z0) ^ n * g z`: on that ball, f' factors as (z - z0)^n times g.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For U open in ℂ and f holomorphic and not constant, with f'(z0) = 0, show that z0 is a zero of f' of finite order.
- The Lean conclusion is the standard precise formulation of “z0 is a zero of f' of finite order”: there exists a neighborhood and a holomorphic g with g(z0) ≠ 0 such that f' = (z - z0)^n g. Because z0 ∈ ball and hder0 is assumed, the representation forces n ≥ 1 (since if n = 0 we would get f'(z0) = g(z0) ≠ 0, contradicting hder0). Thus this exactly encodes “finite order zero” at z0.
- The assumptions match: U open; f holomorphic on U; z0 ∈ U; f not constant (expressed as not equal to the constant f(z0) on U); f'(z0) = 0.
- Using f : ℂ → ℂ with `AnalyticOn ℂ f U` faithfully represents a holomorphic map f : U → ℂ. Requiring the factorization on a ball contained in U is the correct local statement.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The code and the statement match in meaning. The code does not explicitly state n ≥ 1, but this follows from the included hypotheses (hder0 and g(z0) ≠ 0) and the equality at z0.
- The non-constant assumption is stated globally on U in both the natural statement and the Lean code; this is consistent with usual usage. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions, and no auxiliary fake constructs.

Conclusion: The Lean lemma is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line into natural language.
- The context uses ℝ^n modeled as (Fin n → ℝ). We have:
  - n : ℕ, U : Set (Fin n → ℝ), f : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ), p : Fin n → ℝ.
  - hU : IsOpen U, hp : p ∈ U.
  - hf : Prop and hDf_invertible : Prop are arbitrary propositions meant as placeholders for “f is C¹ on U” and “Df at p is invertible”. They carry no actual mathematical content as stated.
- Conclusion asserted:
  - ∃ V W : Set (Fin n → ℝ), such that
    - p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U,
    - f '' V = W (so W = f(V)),
    - f is injective on V (∀ x y ∈ V, f x = f y → x = y),
    - ∃ g : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ), such that
      - ∀ y ∈ W, g y ∈ V ∧ f (g y) = y (g is a left-inverse of f on W and maps W into V),
      - ∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x (g is a right-inverse of f on V),
      - and then an extra conjunct True, a vacuous placeholder presumably for regularity (C¹ and derivative identity), but it imposes no condition.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Original hypotheses:
  - U ⊆ ℝ^n open, f : U → ℝ^n is continuously differentiable, p ∈ U, and Df|_p invertible (det ≠ 0).
- Lean hypotheses:
  - U open and p ∈ U are included correctly.
  - “f is C¹ on U” and “Df|_p invertible” are replaced by arbitrary `Prop` placeholders `hf` and `hDf_invertible`. These are vacuous and do not constrain f at all.
- Original conclusions:
  - ∃ open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W;
  - f|_V is injective; hence an inverse g : W → V exists;
  - g is continuously differentiable and Dg|_y = (Df|_x)⁻¹ for all x ∈ V, y = f(x).
- Lean conclusions:
  - They assert existence of V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U and W = f(V), and injectivity of f on V. This matches part of the statement.
  - They assert existence of a global function g : ℝ^n → ℝ^n that behaves as a two-sided inverse on W and V. Modeling g as a global function with the inverse properties restricted to W and V is acceptable.
  - Missing: openness of V and W. The code does not include IsOpen V nor IsOpen W.
  - Missing: any statement that g is continuously differentiable.
  - Missing: any derivative identity Dg|_y = (Df|_x)⁻¹.
  - The final “∧ True” is a blatant placeholder instead of the differentiability and derivative formula.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code uses vacuous placeholders for the crucial differentiability and invertibility hypotheses (`hf : Prop`, `hDf_invertible : Prop`).
- It omits the openness of V and W.
- It entirely omits the differentiability of g and the derivative identity, replacing them by `True`.
- While some structural parts (existence of V, W, injectivity, inverse behavior) are present, the key analytic content is missing; thus the translation is not faithful.

Auxiliary definition check:
- There are no auxiliary definitions, but the key hypotheses are replaced by arbitrary `Prop` and the differentiability conclusion by `True`, which is vacuous and violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders.

Overall: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib predicates (C¹/HasFDerivAt with invertible linear map) and the missing openness and derivative conclusions added, the shape would be right, but as is, it fails.

- Assumptions:
  - hU : IsOpen U → U is open in ℂ.
  - hconn : IsConnected U → U is connected.
  - hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U → f is holomorphic (complex-differentiable) on U.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If U ⊆ ℂ is open and connected, f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant, and p ∈ U, then there exists δ > 0 such that f restricted to Δ_δ(p) \ {p} is an open map.
- The Lean statement matches this:
  - U open and connected: hU, hconn.
  - f holomorphic on U: hf (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U).
  - f nonconstant: hnon together with hp is equivalent to nonconstancy (if f were constant on U, then f z = f p for all z ∈ U, contradicting hnon).
  - p ∈ U: hp.
  - Existence of δ > 0 with ball p δ ⊆ U ensures the restriction domain is within U, matching the intended restriction f|_{Δ_δ(p) \ {p}}.
  - IsOpenMap on the subtype encodes exactly that this restriction is an open map.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The only minor formal deviation is that Lean takes f : ℂ → ℂ and asserts differentiability only on U (a slight generalization of the domain), and it explicitly includes the condition Metric.ball p δ ⊆ U to justify the restriction domain. Both are standard formalization choices and faithful to the statement’s intent.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; there are no auxiliary definitions at all, only the theorem statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard analysis library.
- `def is_conditionally_convergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)`: Defines conditional convergence for a real series as convergence of the series but non-convergence (divergence) of the series of absolute values. This is the standard definition.
- `theorem conditional_convergence_not_absolute (a : ℕ → ℝ) (h : is_conditionally_convergent a) : ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|) := by sorry`: States that if `a` is conditionally convergent, then it is not absolutely convergent; this is an immediate consequence of the definition.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement says: Suppose the series is conditionally convergent. Show that the terms do not tend to zero fast enough to ensure absolute convergence. In rigorous terms, this means: if the series converges but not absolutely, then the series of absolute values does not converge. The code formalizes exactly this logical content: from conditional convergence, conclude non-absolute convergence. The informal phrase “do not tend to zero fast enough” is a heuristic rephrasing of “the series of absolute values diverges,” which is exactly `¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)`.

3) Final comparison:
- The code restricts to real series (ℝ), which is a harmless specialization.
- The auxiliary definition `is_conditionally_convergent` is legitimate, not vacuous.
- The theorem precisely captures the intended conclusion: conditional convergence implies failure of absolute convergence.
There are no discrepancies that change the meaning. Thus the translation is faithful.

- The theorem `holomorphic_on_implies_analytic {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (h : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) : ∀ z ∈ U, ∃ p : FormalMultilinearSeries ℂ ℂ ℂ, HasFPowerSeriesAt f p z ∧ p.radius ≠ 0`:
  • Hypotheses: U is an open subset of ℂ; f is a function ℂ → ℂ that is complex differentiable on U.
  • Conclusion: For every point z ∈ U, there exists a formal power series p (in the sense of a formal multilinear series) such that f has this power series expansion at z, and the radius of convergence of p is nonzero.
  • `HasFPowerSeriesAt f p z` means f equals the sum of p on some neighborhood of z (i.e., a genuine analytic expansion around z). `p.radius ≠ 0` guarantees positive radius of convergence, but does not quantify it further.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: U is a domain (open and connected) in ℂ, f: U → ℂ holomorphic. Conclude: f is analytic on U; more precisely, around each point there is a Taylor series whose radius of convergence equals the distance to the nearest singularity, and the series sums to f.
- What the code captures:
  • It assumes U is open (not necessarily connected) and f is complex-differentiable on U. This is a standard formalization (f defined on ℂ with DifferentiableOn U).
  • It concludes the existence, at each z, of a power series that sums to f on a neighborhood (so analytic) with positive radius. This captures the “f is analytic on U” part and the “series sums to f” part.
- What is missing or weakened:
  • The code does not address the key refinement “radius of convergence equals the distance to the nearest singularity.” It only asserts that the radius is nonzero, not that it achieves the distance to the nearest singularity (or even at least the distance to the boundary of U).
  • It also omits any discussion of singularities or analytic continuation, which are needed to make sense of “nearest singularity.”
  • The connectivity (“domain”) assumption from the natural statement is dropped. This is a harmless generalization for the local analytic claim, but it underscores that the code is strictly weaker than the full statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The core local analyticity claim (existence of a Taylor/power series summing to f at each point) is present.
- The crucial quantitative statement about the radius of convergence equaling the distance to the nearest singularity is absent. Hence the translation is not faithful to the full natural language statement.

Overall, the code provides a significantly weakened result compared to the stated goal. It uses legitimate Mathlib notions and no vacuous definitions, but it fails to capture the “radius equals nearest singularity” part.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Context: U ⊆ ℂ is open (hU : IsOpen U). f : ℂ → ℂ is a function. We assume f is holomorphic on U (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U). We have a point p ∈ U (hp). We also assume f has a complex derivative at p equal to deriv f p (hder : HasDerivAt f (deriv f p) p), and that deriv f p ≠ 0 (hder_ne).
- Conclusion: There exist open sets V, W ⊆ ℂ such that: V and W are open, p ∈ V ⊆ U, the image f '' V equals W, and f is injective on all of ℂ (Function.Injective (fun x => f x)). Furthermore, there exists a function g : ℂ → ℂ that is holomorphic on W (DifferentiableOn ℂ g W) and satisfies g(f x) = x for all x ∈ V and f(g y) = y for all y ∈ W.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- Original: U ⊆ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then ∃ open V, W ⊆ ℂ with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, and the restriction f|_V is injective with a holomorphic inverse.
- Matches:
  - U open, p ∈ U, f holomorphic on U are encoded as IsOpen U, p ∈ U, and DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. Using f : ℂ → ℂ instead of f : U → ℂ is a standard formalization choice and is acceptable.
  - f'(p) ≠ 0 is captured by HasDerivAt f (deriv f p) p plus deriv f p ≠ 0. The HasDerivAt hypothesis is a bit redundant but compatible.
  - Existence of V, W open with p ∈ V ⊆ U, and f '' V = W corresponds to f(V) = W.
  - Existence of g holomorphic on W with g ∘ f = id_V and f ∘ g = id_W correctly encodes that g is a two-sided inverse between V and W; thus f|_V is a bijection V → W and g its inverse.
- Mismatch:
  - The code requires Function.Injective (fun x => f x), i.e., f is globally injective on all of ℂ. The intended statement requires only that f is injective on V (i.e., InjOn f V or equivalently f|_V is injective). Global injectivity is much stronger and typically false in general; this materially changes the theorem and is not faithful.
  - Minor formalization differences (f defined on ℂ, extra HasDerivAt hypothesis) are fine; the key issue is the global injectivity requirement.

Step 3: Final check.
The two problems are not the same due to the global injectivity condition in the Lean statement instead of injectivity on V. Everything else matches or is an acceptable formalization variant. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- `theorem exists_compact_exhaustion_by_closed_disks {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) :` 
  Means: Let U ⊆ ℂ be an open set.
- `∃ (K : ℕ → Set ℂ),` 
  There exists a sequence (indexed by ℕ) of subsets K_n of ℂ.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n) ∧ K n ⊆ U)` 
  For every n, K_n is compact and K_n ⊆ U. So the K_n are compact subsets of U.
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))` 
  For every n, K_n is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}, i.e., K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}^∘.
- `(U = ⋃ n, interior (K n))` 
  U equals the union over all n of the interiors of K_n, i.e., U = ⋃_n K_n^∘.
- `(∀ n, ∃ (F : Finset (ℂ × ℝ)), K n ⊆ (⋃ p ∈ F, Metric.closedBall p.1 p.2) ∧ (⋃ p ∈ F, Metric.closedBall p.1 p.2) ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))`
  For each n, there exists a finite set F of pairs (center, radius) such that K_n is contained in the finite union of closed balls (i.e., closed disks) centered at p.1 with radius p.2, and that finite union is contained in the interior of K_{n+1}.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: Let U ⊂ ℂ be open. Then there exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U such that (i) K_n ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘, (ii) U = ⋃ K_n^∘, and (iii) for each n there exists a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊂ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊂ K_{n+1}^∘.
- The Lean statement matches exactly:
  - K_n compact subsets of U: present.
  - K_n ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}): present.
  - U equals the union of interiors of K_n: present.
  - Existence of a finite family of closed disks covering K_n and contained in interior(K_{n+1}): modeled as a finite set F of centers and radii with a union of Metric.closedBall, which in ℂ are closed disks. The inclusion chain K_n ⊆ ⋃ closedBall ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}) matches the stated requirement.

Step 3: Final check for differences or issues.
- Indexing starts at ℕ (0) in Lean versus starting at 1 in the natural statement; this is a harmless, standard formalization detail.
- Radii are arbitrary real numbers in the code; negative radii yield empty balls and do not harm the statement since the union must cover K_n, so effectively nonnegative radii will be chosen. Allowing radius 0 (degenerate disks) is standard and acceptable.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is precise and uses Mathlib notions (IsOpen, IsCompact, interior, union, Metric.closedBall, Finset), with no placeholders.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

- `∀ ε > 0, ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : ℂ, dist z 0 > M → dist (f z) L < ε :=` For every epsilon > 0, there exists a real M such that for all complex z, if the distance from z to 0 is greater than M (i.e., |z| > M), then the distance from f z to L is less than epsilon (i.e., |f(z) - L| < ε).
- `by sorry` Proof omitted; only the statement matters for translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: “Suppose L ∈ ℂ. Show that lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M.”
- `Tendsto f (cocompact ℂ) (nhds L)` is precisely “lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere,” since the cocompact filter on ℂ represents approaching the point at infinity in the one-point compactification.
- The right-hand side exactly matches the epsilon–M formulation, with `dist z 0 = |z|` and `dist (f z) L = |f(z) − L|` in ℂ.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain and codomain: f : ℂ → ℂ and L : ℂ, matching the statement “L ∈ ℂ.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only established Mathlib notions are used.
- The quantifiers and inequalities match exactly (ε > 0, |z| > M ⇒ |f(z) − L| < ε). Allowing M to be any real rather than insisting M > 0 is standard and equivalent, since one may replace M by max(M, 0) if needed.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem trivial_nat_eq (x : Nat) : x = x := by rfl`: States and proves that for any natural number `x`, we have `x = x` by reflexivity of equality.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
No. The natural language statement is about complex analysis: a holomorphic function on a domain in C is analytic, admits a Taylor series around any point with radius equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly infinite), and the series sums to the function. The Lean code proves a trivial property of natural numbers (reflexivity), with no mention of complex numbers, holomorphicity, analyticity, Taylor series, or radii of convergence.

3) Final check (differences):
- Subject matter: Lean code is about Nat and equality; the statement is about holomorphic functions on domains in C.
- Concepts: No definitions or theorems about holomorphic functions, Taylor series, radii of convergence, or singularities appear in the code.
- Scope: The code is unrelated and does not even attempt a translation of the mathematical content.

Conclusion: The code is completely unrelated to the statement and is not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X]`: We work in an arbitrary metric space X.
- `theorem isClosed_iff_seq_limit_in_S (S : Set X) : ...`: We state a theorem about a subset S of X.
- Left side: `IsClosed S` means S is closed in X (with the topology induced by the metric).
- Right side: `∀ (u : ℕ → X) (a : X), (∀ n, u n ∈ S) → Filter.Tendsto u Filter.atTop (nhds a) → a ∈ S` says: for every sequence u in X and every point a in X, if all terms of u are in S and u converges to a in X (expressed as `Tendsto u atTop (nhds a)`), then a belongs to S.
- The theorem asserts the equivalence (↔) between S being closed and S being sequentially closed with respect to convergent sequences in X.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S."" This is exactly captured by the Lean statement: the right-hand side formalizes ""every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S"" via Filter.Tendsto, and the left-hand side is IsClosed S. The metric space hypothesis ensures equivalence between closedness and sequential closedness.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms are standard Mathlib notions.
- The quantification over sequences and limits is accurate; requiring `Tendsto u atTop (nhds a)` expresses convergence in X, and `(∀ n, u n ∈ S)` encodes ""sequence in S"".

Final check:
- The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language theorem with no added or missing assumptions, and matches the intended equivalence in metric spaces.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_compact_exhaustion_by_closed_disks (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) :` states: Let U be an open subset of ℂ.
- `∃ (K : ℕ → Set ℂ),` there exists a sequence K_n of subsets of ℂ.
- `(∀ n, IsCompact (K n))` each K_n is compact.
- `(∀ n, K n ⊆ interior (K (n+1)))` the sequence is strictly increasing in the sense K_n ⊆ (K_{n+1})°.
- `U = (⋃ n : ℕ, interior (K n))` U equals the union of the interiors of the K_n.
- `(∀ n, ∃ (s : Finset (ℂ × ℝ)), ... )` for each n there exists a finite set s of pairs (center, radius) in ℂ × ℝ.
- `K n ⊆ (⋃ p ∈ s, Metric.closedBall p.fst p.snd)` K_n is contained in the union of the corresponding closed balls (disks) given by s.
- `(⋃ p ∈ s, Metric.closedBall p.fst p.snd) ⊆ interior (K (n+1))` and that union of disks is contained in (K_{n+1})°.

Assessment vs the natural-language statement:
- The natural statement: For open U ⊆ ℂ, there exists a sequence K_n of compact subsets of U with K_n ⊆ K_{n+1}°, U = ⋃ K_n°, and for each n a finite collection of closed disks D_{kn} with K_n ⊆ ⋃_k D_{kn} ⊆ K_{n+1}°.
- The Lean statement matches all structural requirements: sequence of compact sets, nesting via interior, union of interiors equals U, and for each n a finite family of closed disks (metric closed balls in ℂ) sandwiched between K_n and the interior of K_{n+1}.
- One potential concern is that Lean does not explicitly state K_n ⊆ U. However, it is implied: from U = ⋃ interior(K_m) we get interior(K_{n+1}) ⊆ U for each n; combined with K_n ⊆ interior(K_{n+1}) it follows that K_n ⊆ U. Hence the “compact subsets of U” condition is satisfied implicitly.
- Using `Metric.closedBall` in ℂ accurately formalizes closed disks. The radii are allowed to be any real numbers, but since the statement is existential, we can choose nonnegative radii; allowing negative radii only produces empty disks and does not hinder existence.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; the only use of `sorry` is the proof placeholder, which is acceptable for translation auditing. All concepts used are standard Mathlib notions.

Final check: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement; any seemingly missing inclusion K_n ⊆ U is logically implied by the given conditions. Therefore, the two statements are the same in mathematical meaning.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Complex: We are working in the complex numbers with Mathlib's standard structures.
- variable {f : Complex → Complex} {L : Complex}: f is a complex-valued function on C, and L is a complex number.
- def tendsto_in_riemann_at_infty (f : Complex → Complex) (L : Complex) : Prop := ∀ U : Set Complex, IsOpen U → L ∈ U → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : Complex, Complex.abs z > M → f z ∈ U
  Translation: Define “f tends to L at infinity (in the Riemann sphere sense)” to mean: for every open set U in C containing L, there exists a real M such that for all z with |z| > M, f(z) ∈ U. This is exactly the neighborhood definition of the limit at infinity, using the topology around the finite point L (which matches the Riemann sphere topology at finite points).
- theorem limit_at_infty_riemann_iff_epsilon (f : Complex → Complex) (L : Complex) : tendsto_in_riemann_at_infty f L ↔ (∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : Complex, Complex.abs z > M → Complex.abs (f z - L) < ε)
  Translation: The above neighborhood definition is equivalent to the epsilon-definition: for every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all z with |z| > M, we have |f(z) − L| < ε.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement: “Suppose L ∈ C. Show that lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M.”
- The Lean definition tendsto_in_riemann_at_infty matches the Riemann sphere sense at a finite point L: neighborhoods of L in the Riemann sphere are the same as usual open neighborhoods in C, so quantifying over open sets U containing L is correct.
- The epsilon condition in the theorem is exactly the standard metric formulation.
- Therefore, the theorem statement gives precisely the requested equivalence.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous placeholders: the custom definition is substantive, not trivially true.
- The use of open neighborhoods (IsOpen U ∧ L ∈ U) is equivalent to quantifying over all neighborhoods when L is finite, which is our case (L : Complex).
- The domain approach “|z| > M” correctly matches z → ∞.
- The theorem’s statement matches the iff in the problem exactly.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompleteSpace X]` declares a type X equipped with a metric space structure and assumes X is complete. This matches the natural language ""(X,d) be a complete metric space.""
- `theorem baire_category_metric (U : ℕ → Set X) (hU : ∀ n, IsOpen (U n) ∧ Dense (U n)) : Dense (⋂ n, U n) := by sorry` states: given a sequence of subsets U indexed by natural numbers, if for every n, U n is open and dense, then the intersection over all n of U n is dense. This is exactly the Baire category theorem for complete metric spaces.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: in a complete metric space, a countable intersection of open dense sets is dense. The code formalizes exactly this: completeness is assumed, the family is ℕ-indexed (countable), each U n is open and dense, and the conclusion is that the intersection is dense.

Final check and differences:
- Minor indexing difference: the natural language uses {U_n}_{n=1}^∞, while the Lean code indexes by ℕ starting at 0. This is a harmless reindexing/generalization; it does not change the mathematical content.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; all concepts are standard Mathlib (`IsOpen`, `Dense`, `⋂`).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `cauchy_product_abs_summable_of_a_abs_summable` considers two real sequences `a b : ℕ → ℝ`.
- Hypotheses:
  - `ha : Summable (fun n => abs (a n))` means the series ∑ |a n| converges (i.e., a is absolutely summable).
  - `hb : Summable b` means the series ∑ b n converges (not necessarily absolutely).
- Conclusion:
  - `Summable (fun n => abs (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n+1)) fun k => a k * b (n - k)))` means the series whose nth term is the absolute value of the nth Cauchy product coefficient `∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}` is summable. That is, the Cauchy product series is absolutely summable.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then the Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely. The Lean statement exactly encodes this for real sequences: it assumes absolute summability of `a`, plain summability of `b`, and concludes absolute summability of the Cauchy product coefficients.
- The definition of the Cauchy product term `∑_{k=0}^n a k * b (n - k)` is standard. Indexing starts at 0 in Lean; the natural language starts at 1, but this is a harmless shift and standard in formalization.
- The specialization to real sequences (ℝ) is explicitly stated in the comment and is a reasonable specialization of the general claim.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions since we are only checking the statement’s faithfulness, not its proof.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem matches the mathematical meaning of the natural language claim (despite the fact that the mathematical claim is actually false in general; our task is faithfulness, not correctness). No discrepancies beyond benign indexing and specialization to ℝ.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex Finset`: Set up standard libraries and namespaces.
- The theorem declaration:
  - Inputs: `f : ℂ → ℂ` (a complex function), `a : ℕ → ℂ` (a sequence of complex coefficients), `h_analytic : Prop` (an arbitrary proposition meant to stand for holomorphicity), and `h0 : f 0 ≠ 0`.
  - Statement: From the assumption `h_analytic`, there exists a real constant `C` such that for all natural numbers `m` and all complex numbers `z` with `|z| ≤ 1`, we have
    `|1 - ∑_{k=0}^m a k * z^k| ≤ C * |z|^(m+1)`.
- There is no definition tying `a k` to the derivatives of `f` at 0, and `h_analytic` is an arbitrary, uninterpreted `Prop`.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Original statement: If `f` is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and `f(0) ≠ 0`, then there exists a constant `C` such that for all `m ∈ ℕ` and all `z` with `|z| ≤ 1`,
  `|1 - ∑_{k=0}^m (f^{(k)}(0) / (k! f(0))) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}`.
- Key features of the original:
  - A concrete analytic hypothesis: `f` is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk.
  - The coefficients in the sum are precisely `f^{(k)}(0) / (k! f(0))` (normalized Taylor coefficients of `f` at 0).
  - The assumption `f(0) ≠ 0` is used to make the normalization by `f(0)` make sense.
- In the Lean theorem:
  - The analytic hypothesis is replaced by an arbitrary proposition `h_analytic : Prop`, with no connection to holomorphicity.
  - The coefficients `a : ℕ → ℂ` are completely arbitrary and not tied to `f` or its derivatives.
  - The inequality is asserted for the arbitrary `a`, which is far stronger than (and unrelated to) the original claim.
  - The assumption `h0 : f 0 ≠ 0` appears but is not connected to the sum (since `a` is arbitrary), so it has no effect on the statement.
  - The form `C * |z|^(m+1)` vs `C |z|^(m+1)` is fine; but there is no requirement that `C ≥ 0`. This is a minor technicality.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is not a faithful translation. It turns the specific analytic hypothesis into an uninterpreted placeholder, and more critically, it replaces the specific coefficients determined by the derivatives of `f` with an arbitrary sequence `a`. As written, the Lean statement claims a bound for any choice of coefficients `a`, which is not the mathematical statement at all. The variable `h_analytic` is vacuous, and there is no link between `a` and `f`.
- If `h_analytic` were replaced by a precise holomorphic-on-neighborhood assumption and if `a k` were defined to be `f^{(k)}(0) / (k! f(0))`, then the theorem statement would be faithful. But in its current form, it is not.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- `variable {n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] {R : Type*} [CommRing R]`: work with an index type `n` that is finite and decidable, and a commutative ring `R`.
- `def perm_matrix (σ : Equiv.Perm n) : Matrix n n R := fun i j => if j = σ i then (1 : R) else 0`: defines the permutation matrix associated to a permutation `σ` by placing 1 in row `i`, column `σ i`, and 0 elsewhere. This is a standard definition of a permutation matrix (one of the two common conventions; the other uses σ acting on columns; both give determinant ±1).
- The theorem `det_perm_matrix_eq_neg_one_or_one (σ : Equiv.Perm n) : Matrix.det (perm_matrix σ) = (-1 : R) ∨ Matrix.det (perm_matrix σ) = (1 : R)` asserts that for any permutation σ, the determinant of the associated permutation matrix over any commutative ring R is either −1 or 1.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Let P be a permutation matrix. Prove det(P) ∈ {−1,1} (without Laplace).” The code formalizes this as a theorem stating that the determinant of the permutation matrix for any σ is either −1 or 1. Using a disjunction is equivalent to membership in {−1,1}. The ring generality (any CommRing R) is a mild and acceptable generalization since the determinant in a ring still evaluates to ±1, with −1 possibly equal to 1 in characteristic 2 (still satisfies the disjunction). The precise proof method (without Laplace) is not encoded, which is fine because we are checking the statement, not the proof.
- The definition `perm_matrix` is a legitimate, standard definition (not vacuous). There are no fake placeholders. The theorem statement itself is exactly the intended mathematical content.
- Potential convention differences (left/right action) do not affect the determinant’s value being ±1, since det of the inverse permutation matrix equals det of the original and sign(σ) = sign(σ⁻¹).

Final check:
- The Lean theorem faithfully matches the natural language claim, with a harmless generalization to any commutative ring. No vacuous or misleading auxiliary definitions. Therefore, it passes.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic and injective, then f is a conformal mapping onto its image; i.e., f is a holomorphic bijection from ℂ to f(ℂ) with holomorphic inverse f^{-1} defined on f(ℂ).
- Discrepancy 1 (vacuous predicate): The code uses an arbitrary predicate Analytic with no connection to Mathlib’s holomorphic/analytic notions. This is a vacuous/placeholder definition and fails the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate.
- Discrepancy 2 (domain/codomain of the inverse): The theorem asserts existence of a global g : ℂ → ℂ with g ∘ f = id and g ""Analytic"". The intended statement only requires the inverse to be holomorphic on f(ℂ), not extend holomorphically to all of ℂ. Requiring a global holomorphic extension is a much stronger statement and generally false; thus the code is not a faithful translation.
- Discrepancy 3 (conformality vocabulary): The code does not mention conformal mapping, nonvanishing derivative, or holomorphic inverse on the image. It only asks for a left inverse globally.
- Even if we replaced Analytic with the correct Mathlib notion (e.g., holomorphic), the theorem still claims a global holomorphic left inverse g : ℂ → ℂ, which is stronger than (and not equivalent to) having a holomorphic inverse on f(ℂ). So the final theorem would still not be faithful.

Final check: The two problems are different. The Lean statement imposes an unrealistic global extension of the inverse and uses a vacuous predicate in place of holomorphic/analytic. Therefore, it is not a faithful formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {x : ℕ → ℝ} {ℓ : ℝ}`: We consider a real sequence x: ℕ → ℝ and a real number ℓ.
- Hypothesis `h_bdd : ∃ M, 0 ≤ M ∧ ∀ n, |x n| ≤ M`: There exists a nonnegative real M such that for all n, the absolute value |x n| ≤ M. This asserts that the sequence (x_n) is bounded.
- Hypothesis `h_subseq : ∀ s : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono s → ∀ L : ℝ, Tendsto (x ∘ s) atTop (nhds L) → L = ℓ`: For every strictly increasing function s: ℕ → ℕ (i.e., for every subsequence), and for every real L, if the subsequence x ∘ s converges to L, then L = ℓ. This states that any convergent subsequence of x has limit ℓ.
- Conclusion `Tendsto x atTop (nhds ℓ)`: The sequence x_n converges to ℓ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""If {x_n} is bounded and every convergent subsequence has the same limit ℓ, then x_n → ℓ.""
- The Lean hypotheses exactly encode boundedness and the property that any convergent subsequence has limit ℓ. The conclusion is that x tends to ℓ. The use of `StrictMono s` correctly models subsequences. The boundedness hypothesis with `0 ≤ M` is a standard, equivalent form for boundedness in ℝ.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: real sequences in both descriptions. The code restricts to ℝ, which matches the usual setting of the statement.
- Boundedness: The code uses an absolute value bound with M ≥ 0, equivalent to boundedness. No substantive difference.
- Subsequence condition: The code says any convergent subsequence has limit ℓ, identical to the natural language. It does not assert existence of convergent subsequences, nor does the natural language; existence follows from boundedness in ℝ but is not needed as an assumption.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`: Bring in Mathlib and filter notation; no mathematical content change.
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]`: We work with a type X equipped with a metric space structure, matching the natural language assumption that X is a metric space.
- The theorem `compact_space_sequentially_compact (h : CompactSpace X) : ∀ (x : ℕ → X), ∃ (a : X) (f : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono f ∧ Tendsto (fun n => x (f n)) atTop (nhds a)` states: assuming `h : CompactSpace X` (i.e., X is compact: every open cover has a finite subcover), then for every sequence `x : ℕ → X`, there exists a point `a : X` and a strictly increasing function `f : ℕ → ℕ` (a subsequence selector) such that the subsequence `n ↦ x (f n)` converges to `a` (formalized as `Tendsto ... atTop (nhds a)`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Assumptions match: The natural language requires X be a metric space with the property that every open cover has a finite subcover; Lean uses `[MetricSpace X]` and `h : CompactSpace X`, which is exactly that property for the whole space.
- Conclusion matches: The natural language asserts that every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence. Lean formalizes a subsequence by a strictly monotone `f : ℕ → ℕ`, and convergence by `Tendsto (fun n => x (f n)) atTop (nhds a)`. This is the standard formalization of “x ∘ f converges to a”.

3) Final check: same or different?
- They are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly captures the intended meaning. There is no change in generality or scope. The Lean statement precisely formalizes the classical result that compactness in metric spaces implies sequential compactness.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `theorem cauchy_product_of_absolutely_summable {a b : ℕ → ℂ}`: We consider two complex sequences a, b.
- Hypotheses: `(ha : Summable (fun n => Complex.abs (a n)))` and `(hb : Summable (fun n => Complex.abs (b n)))`. This means both series ∑ |a n| and ∑ |b n| converge (absolute convergence of a and b).

- `by sorry`: Proof omitted; acceptable here per instructions since we only audit the statement.

Notes on details:
- `Finset.range (n+1)` restricts m to 0 ≤ m ≤ n, making `n - m : ℕ` correct for the convolution.
- Using `Complex.abs` for absolute value matches the norm on ℂ (‖z‖ = |z|), so this is the standard notion of absolute convergence.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; nothing vacuous.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The code assumes absolute convergence of both series and concludes: (i) absolute convergence of the Cauchy product, and (ii) the sum equals the product of the sums. This precisely matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check of differences:
- The Lean statement specializes to ℂ-valued series, while the natural language statement is general but typically intended over ℝ or ℂ. This is a harmless specialization and faithful.
- All other elements (definition of Cauchy product, absolute convergence, equality of sums) align exactly.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- Variables and context: a, b : ℝ; U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U. This matches “U ⊂ ℂ is open”.
- f : ℂ → ℂ with hfd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U. This asserts f is holomorphic on U (complex-differentiable on U), consistent with the statement. Note: f is defined on all ℂ in Lean, but only required to be holomorphic on U, while the natural language has f : U → ℂ; this is a harmless generalization.
- hfnc : ¬ ∃ c : ℂ, ∀ z ∈ U, f z = c. This says f is nonconstant on U, matching the statement.
- α : ℝ → ℂ with hα : DifferentiableOn ℝ α (Icc a b). This says α is (real) differentiable on [a, b]. The natural statement says “smooth”; Lean assumes only C^1, which is a weaker hypothesis but generally acceptable as a slight generalization if the claim only needs differentiability.
- hα' : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, deriv α t ≠ 0. This matches “α′(t) ≠ 0 for all t ∈ [a, b]”.
- hα_range : ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, α t ∈ U. This enforces α([a, b]) ⊆ U, matching α : [a, b] → U.
- Conclusion: StrictMonoOn (fun t => Complex.arg (f (α t))) (Icc a b) ↔ (∃ θ, ∀ t ∈ Icc a b, Complex.arg (deriv f (α t) * deriv α t) = θ).
  • Left-hand side says the function t ↦ arg(f(α(t))) is strictly increasing on [a, b] (with arg taken as the principal argument Complex.arg).
  • Right-hand side says there exists a constant θ such that for all t ∈ [a, b], arg(f′(α(t)) · α′(t)) = θ (again with principal argument).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Holomorphic, nonconstant, open set, and image of α in U: these are correctly represented.
- Smoothness of α: the Lean code assumes differentiable (C^1) rather than smooth (C^∞). This is a mild generalization and is acceptable if the original intent does not truly require higher regularity.
- Main equivalence:
  • The natural language says “f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a, b] if and only if arg(f′(α(t)) α′(t)) is constant.”
  • The code uses Complex.arg directly both for the value f(α(t)) and for f′(α(t)) α′(t). Complex.arg is the principal branch (and is defined at 0 by convention in Mathlib), whereas the mathematical ‘arg’ is usually undefined at 0 and is inherently multi-valued, with the intended reading along a path being a continuous branch. The Lean statement imposes a specific (principal) branch and allows zeros without extra hypotheses. This is a nontrivial deviation.
  • The phrase “changes argument strictly monotonically” in math usually means the argument is a strictly monotone function of t, but does not specify increasing vs decreasing. The Lean code uses StrictMonoOn, which is strictly increasing only; it does not allow strictly decreasing behavior (StrictAntiOn). This is a significant mismatch: the natural statement is symmetric in the direction of monotonicity; the Lean statement is not.
  • The Lean statement does not assume that f ∘ α avoids 0 on [a, b]. In typical complex analysis, arg(f ∘ α) is not defined at zeros of f ∘ α, so one would usually require nonvanishing to talk about arg on an interval. The code bypasses this by using Complex.arg, which is defined at 0. This is another conceptual mismatch.
  • Similarly, the right side uses arg(f′(α(t)) α′(t)) without assuming nonvanishing of f′(α(t)). In standard usage arg is undefined at 0, while Lean’s Complex.arg assigns a value at 0.

Step 3: Final comparison
- Matching parts:
  • Open set, holomorphic, nonconstant, curve into U, nonvanishing α′, and the structural form of the equivalence are aligned.
- Differences:
  • Strictly increasing vs strictly monotone (increasing or decreasing) on the left: the code is overly restrictive.
  • Use of principal argument Complex.arg throughout, including at zeros, instead of a continuous branch of arg and avoiding zeros. The natural statement implicitly uses the latter.
  • Minor: f is ℂ → ℂ in Lean with differentiability only on U, rather than f : U → ℂ; acceptable generalization.
  • Minor: no explicit assumption a ≤ b; Icc a b is empty if a > b, which could make the equivalence vacuously true. The natural language implicitly assumes a ≤ b.

Conclusion: While the overall shape of the theorem mirrors the natural language, the key semantic differences regarding the meaning of “argument” (principal branch vs continuous branch and behavior at zeros) and the direction of monotonicity (StrictMonoOn only) make the formal statement not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholders; hypotheses largely match; structural equivalence present; but significant conceptual mismatches on the notion of argument and monotonicity direction. Hence not faithful, with a score reflecting that the structure is close but materially different.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- Context: f : ℂ → ℂ, z0 : ℂ.
- Statement: Filter.Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) atTop ↔ ∀ M : ℝ, 0 < M → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z : ℂ, ‖z - z0‖ < δ → ‖f z‖ > M.
  In words: The real-valued function z ↦ |f(z)| tends to +∞ as z → z0 (with respect to the neighborhood filter nhds z0) if and only if for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all z, if |z - z0| < δ then |f z| > M.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the Riemann sphere sense iff for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z - z0| < δ.”
- Two key aspects:
  1) The left side refers to the limit of f to ∞ in the Riemann sphere (i.e., in ℂ∞). A faithful formalization would be Tendsto (fun z => (f z : RiemannSphere)) (𝓝[≠] z0) (𝓝 ∞), or an equivalent formulation via norms: Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (𝓝[≠] z0) atTop.
  2) The ε–δ condition for limits at z0 should exclude the point z0, i.e., 0 < |z - z0| < δ. This matches the punctured neighborhood filter 𝓝[≠] z0.

Step 3: Identify discrepancies.
- The code uses (nhds z0), the unpunctured neighborhood filter, rather than the punctured filter 𝓝[≠] z0. This wrongly forces the condition to include z = z0, making the statement strictly stronger than the standard limit notion and generally false unless |f z0| is already arbitrarily large.
- The right-hand side in the code also omits the ‘0 <’ and quantifies over all z with ‖z - z0‖ < δ, again including z = z0.
- The left-hand side in the code is “‖f‖ → atTop” rather than “f → ∞ in the Riemann sphere.” While these are equivalent in standard analysis, the code does not state the Riemann sphere formulation; it instead asserts only the equivalence between “‖f‖ → atTop” and the M–δ condition (with the non-punctured error). So it misses the sphere part and also mis-specifies the filter.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. The use of nhds z0 (and the corresponding non-punctured ε–δ) is a significant error for limits, and the theorem does not actually mention the Riemann sphere side explicitly. Hence it fails the faithfulness check.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_1436 (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z0 : ℂ) :` introduces a function f: ℂ → ℂ and a point z0 ∈ ℂ.
- `Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) (nhds z0) (atTop : Filter ℝ) ↔` states that the real-valued function z ↦ ‖f z‖ tends to +∞ as z → z0 with respect to the neighborhood filter `nhds z0`.
- `∀ M : ℝ, 0 < M → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z : ℂ, ‖z - z0‖ < δ → ‖f z‖ > M` gives the epsilon-delta style characterization: for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if ‖z − z0‖ < δ then ‖f z‖ > M.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural language states: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z−z0| < δ.”
- Interpreting “in the sense of the Riemann sphere” means the limit of f, viewed as a map into the Riemann sphere (OnePoint ℂ), is ∞ with respect to the punctured limit (i.e., approaching z0 with z ≠ z0). In mathlib, the precise filter for this is 𝓝[≠] z0 (nhdsWithin z0 {z | z ≠ z0}), and the norm characterization is equivalent to Tendsto (fun z => ‖f z‖) 𝓝[≠] z0 atTop.
- The Lean code, however, uses (nhds z0), not the punctured filter. This is a critical difference: Tendsto to atTop along nhds z0 forces ‖f z0‖ to be arbitrarily large, which is impossible for f : ℂ → ℂ unless f z0 is not finite. Thus the left-hand side of the Lean statement is too strong and generally false for ordinary functions.
- Likewise, on the right-hand side, the condition uses ‖z − z0‖ < δ (including z = z0) instead of the punctured 0 < ‖z − z0‖ < δ that corresponds to the usual notion of limit as z → z0. This again forces ‖f z0‖ > M for all M, which is not intended.
- Additionally, the Lean code does not explicitly mention the Riemann sphere (OnePoint ℂ); while using the norm-to-∞ characterization is acceptable, it must be along the punctured filter.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - Filter mismatch: uses nhds z0 instead of 𝓝[≠] z0. This changes the meaning substantially and makes the statement incorrect in general.
  - Missing puncture on the δ-condition: uses ‖z − z0‖ < δ instead of 0 < ‖z − z0‖ < δ, again imposing a condition at z0 that is not part of the limit definition.
  - Does not explicitly use the Riemann sphere; acceptable if replaced by the equivalent norm→∞ characterization, but only if the punctured filter is used.
- Conclusion: The code is close in spirit but not faithful due to the crucial filter and puncturing issues; it does not correctly capture “in the sense of the Riemann sphere.”

Grade justification: No vacuous definitions; the shape is almost correct, but the wrong filter and missing puncture are serious semantic errors. Hence not faithful; score reflects a substantial but fixable discrepancy.

However, because RiemannIntegrableOn is defined as True, the statement is vacuous. Moreover, the proof is omitted via sorry.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For a metric space (X,d), if S ⊆ X is totally bounded and f : S → ℝ is continuous, then f is Riemann integrable. This is about a general metric domain S (totally bounded) and continuity on S.
- The code instead addresses only functions f : ℝ → ℝ on subsets of ℝ (specifically the closed interval Icc a b), not an arbitrary metric space. It does not mention totally bounded sets, nor a general S ⊆ X, nor any metric structure on the domain.
- The predicate RiemannIntegrableOn is defined to be True, which makes the theorem vacuous and not a faithful representation of Riemann integrability.
- Therefore, the code neither states nor formalizes the given theorem; it only presents a (vacuous) and different classical result (continuous on [a,b] ⇒ Riemann integrable on [a,b]) and even that is encoded via a fake predicate.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different. The domain differs (general metric space vs ℝ), the hypothesis differs (totally bounded set S vs closed interval [a,b]), and the integrability notion is replaced by a vacuous placeholder. Additionally, an auxiliary definition is vacuous (:= True), violating the guidelines. Even if the vacuous predicate were replaced with a proper one, the final theorem would still not match the original statement (it would only cover continuous functions on closed intervals in ℝ).

Given these discrepancies and the vacuous definition, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- We work in Euclidean space modeled as Fin n → ℝ.
- U : Set (Fin n → ℝ) is a subset of ℝ^n, and f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is a real-valued function.
- hU : Convex ℝ U says U is convex.
- hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U says f is C^2 on the set U (in the on-set sense, i.e., using within-derivatives on U).
- The statement: For any compact K with K ⊆ U, for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all v with ‖v‖ < δ and x + v ∈ U, we have
  | f(x+v) - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) v - (1/2) * (((fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x) v) v) | ≤ ε * ‖v‖^2.
  Here (fderiv ℝ f x) is the Fréchet derivative (gradient as a linear map) of f at x (unrestricted derivative), and fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x is the second derivative viewed as a map E → L(E, ℝ), so applying to v twice gives the quadratic form vᵀ H_f(x) v.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ is C^2, with Hessian H_f continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean statement captures: uniform second-order Taylor estimate on compact K ⊆ U, with a remainder bounded by ε‖v‖^2, uniformly in x ∈ K, for small v with x+v ∈ U. This matches the intended uniform second-order expansion.
- ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U is an appropriate formalization of “f is C^2 on U and the Hessian is continuous on U.”
- The convexity of U and the requirement x ∈ U and x+v ∈ U ensure the segment [x, x+v] ⊆ U, which is standard in such Taylor arguments on sets.

Step 3: Check for discrepancies.
- Key issue: The code uses the unrestricted derivatives fderiv ℝ f x and fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x. However, the hypotheses only give ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U (on-set smoothness). If U is not open (and the statement does not assume openness), ContDiffOn gives within-derivatives (fderivWithin), not necessarily the unrestricted derivatives. In Mathlib, fderiv ℝ f x is defined regardless of differentiability (defaulting to 0 if not differentiable), and it coincides with the within derivative only under extra conditions (e.g., x ∈ interior U, or unique-differentiability conditions). Since the theorem does not assume U is open or that within- and unrestricted derivatives agree, the formula in the code may refer to the wrong derivatives at boundary points.
- The natural language statement speaks about C^2 on U with continuous Hessian on U and the Taylor expansion along directions that stay in U. A faithful Lean formalization on an arbitrary convex (not necessarily open) U should use fderivWithin (and the second derivative within U) rather than fderiv; or should assume K ⊆ interior U or U open.
- Otherwise, the structure (uniform on compact K ⊆ U, the quadratic approximation with 1/2 vᵀ H v, and the ε‖v‖^2 bound) matches well.

Conclusion:
- The only substantive mismatch is the use of unrestricted derivatives instead of within-derivatives on a possibly non-open set U. This is a technical but important discrepancy in faithfully encoding the statement on general convex sets. Everything else aligns well with the natural language statement.

This states: For real c with 0 ≤ c < 1, the series ∑ x^k (as a function series in x) converges uniformly on the closed interval [-c, c]. The set Icc (-c) c is exactly the interval [-c, c]. The definition of uniform_converges_on uses finite sums ∑_{k=0}^n, i.e., partial sums, as expected.

2) Whole translation vs original statement:
The natural language asks to show that for 0 ≤ c < 1, the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on [-c, c]. The Lean code defines a precise and standard notion of uniform convergence for series (via partial sums) and asserts this for the geometric series on Icc (-c) c. This matches the original statement exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: real x; interval [-c, c]; matches.
- Hypotheses: 0 ≤ c < 1; matches.
- Claim: uniform convergence of the series ∑ x^k on that set; matches, with the limit function left unspecified (which is fine, as the natural statement does not specify it).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the custom definition is legitimate and faithful. No extraneous auxiliary definitions. Therefore the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`: bring in Mathlib and filter notation used for convergence.
- `variable (X : Type*) [MetricSpace X]`: Fix a type X equipped with a metric space structure.
- The theorem `sequential_compact_metric_compact` states: If for every sequence `u : ℕ → X` there exists a strictly increasing function `v : ℕ → ℕ` (a subsequence selector) and a point `x : X` such that `(u ∘ v)` tends to `x` in the sense of filters (`Tendsto (u ∘ v) atTop (nhds x)`), then `X` is a `CompactSpace`, i.e., the whole space X is compact.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The hypothesis `∀ u : ℕ → X, ∃ v : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono v ∧ ∃ x : X, Tendsto (u ∘ v) atTop (nhds x)` precisely formalizes “every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence (in X)”. The use of a strictly monotone `v` encodes choosing a subsequence, and `Tendsto ... (nhds x)` encodes convergence to `x` in the metric topology.
- The conclusion `CompactSpace X` formalizes “every open cover of X has a finite subcover” (the standard definition of compactness in topology; in Mathlib, `CompactSpace X` is the topological compactness of the whole space, equivalent to the open cover definition).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib ones.

3) Final check comparison:
- Natural language: sequential compactness ⇒ every open cover has a finite subcover (compactness) for a metric space X.
- Lean: assumes sequential compactness for a metric space X, concludes `CompactSpace X`.
- These are the same statement, with standard formalization details (subsequence as `StrictMono v`, convergence via `Tendsto`). No discrepancies.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in ℝ^n modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`.
- The theorem `second_order_taylor_uniform_on_compact` assumes:
  - `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)` and `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`.
  - `hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U`: f is C^2 on U in the Fréchet sense; in particular, derivatives up to order 2 exist and are continuous on U.
  - `hU : Convex ℝ U`: U is convex.
- The conclusion is: For every compact `K ⊆ U` and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ,
  | f(x + h) − f x − fderiv ℝ f x h − (1/2) * fderiv ℝ (fun y => (fderiv ℝ f y h)) x h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here:
  - `fderiv ℝ f x` is the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map), so `fderiv ℝ f x h` is the first-order term at x applied to h.
  - `fderiv ℝ (fun y => (fderiv ℝ f y h)) x h` is D of the map y ↦ Df(y)·h, evaluated at x in direction h, which equals the second derivative D²f(x)(h,h). Thus the middle terms represent the second-order Taylor polynomial up to order 2 with factor 1/2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that for f : ℝ^n → ℝ, C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U, the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean statement uses `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U` (C² with continuous derivatives up to order 2 on U), which entails continuity of the Hessian. This matches or is a standard formalization of “C^2 with H_f continuous.”
- The convexity assumption `hU : Convex ℝ U` is included. While not explicitly used in the conclusion, it justifies that line segments from x to x+h stay in U when x, x+h ∈ U, which is a typical requirement for Taylor remainder estimates on domains. The statement ensures x ∈ K ⊆ U and x + h ∈ U.
- The conclusion is exactly a uniform second-order remainder estimate: for compact K ⊆ U and any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 uniform over x ∈ K such that the error after subtracting the first and second-order terms is ≤ ε‖h‖². This is precisely “the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.”
- The use of `(Fin n → ℝ)` for ℝ^n is standard in Mathlib and is equivalent to the usual ℝ^n.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only potential apparent difference is that the natural language explicitly mentions the Hessian H_f being continuous, while the code uses `ContDiffOn ℝ 2`. In Mathlib, `ContDiffOn ℝ 2` implies continuous second derivative, hence continuity of the Hessian; so this is not a discrepancy.
- The quadratic term is correctly represented via `fderiv ℝ (fun y => (fderiv ℝ f y h)) x h = D²f(x)(h,h)`, and the 1/2 factor is present.
- The uniformity quantified over compact K and small h with x + h ∈ U is included. Convexity of U ensures the segment [x, x+h] lies in U, aligning with standard hypotheses.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The setting is subsets s of R^n, modeled as `Fin n → ℝ`.
- Hypotheses:
  - `hconv : Convex ℝ s` means s is convex.
  - `hbounded : ∃ x0 R, 0 < R ∧ s ⊆ Metric.ball x0 R` means s is bounded (it is contained in some open ball of finite positive radius around x0). This is a standard equivalent formulation of boundedness in a metric space.
- Conclusion: `MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume (frontier s) = 0` says the Lebesgue measure (volume) of the topological boundary (frontier) of s is zero.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: ""Prove that every bounded convex set in R^n is Jordan measurable.""
- In Euclidean space, a bounded set is Jordan measurable if and only if its boundary has Lebesgue measure zero. The code proves precisely that the boundary has measure zero for any bounded convex set, which implies Jordan measurability. The boundedness is included as a hypothesis, and convexity is assumed as required.
- The code uses `Fin n → ℝ` to model R^n and Lebesgue volume via `MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume`, which is standard in Mathlib.
- While the Lean statement does not explicitly mention a ""Jordan measurable"" predicate, it asserts the standard equivalent property (boundary has measure zero) under boundedness, which is exactly what the natural language statement requires.

Check for discrepancies or red flags:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only existing Mathlib notions are used.
- The use of open ball with R > 0 to express boundedness is legitimate and equivalent to the usual notion.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization (via an equivalent characterization) of the natural language claim.

Final check: The two problems are the same in mathematical meaning. The only difference is phrasing Jordan measurability via the equivalent boundary-measure-zero criterion, which is acceptable and faithful.

- The natural language: In a normed vector space X, if f: X → ℝ is differentiable at x0 and attains a local minimum at x0, then Df(x0) = 0 in L(X, ℝ).
- The Lean statement uses `HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0` to express differentiability at x0 with derivative given by `fderiv ℝ f x0`, and `IsLocalMin f x0` for the local minimum. The conclusion is that the continuous linear derivative equals 0 in `X →L[ℝ] ℝ`. This is exactly the formal counterpart of the original statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only technical difference is using `HasFDerivAt` with the specific `fderiv ℝ f x0` rather than `DifferentiableAt`. This is a standard and faithful way to express differentiability at a point with its derivative in Mathlib. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The target space `X →L[ℝ] ℝ` matches L(X, ℝ).
- Therefore, the code is a faithful translation of the statement.

- The function `1 / (1 - x)` is the pointwise limit of the geometric series on |x|<1.
- The absolute value `abs (...) ≥ ε` quantifies the deviation from the limit function.

2) Does the overall statement match the natural language?
- The natural statement says the series ∑_{k=0}^∞ x^k does not converge uniformly on (−1,1). The Lean statement gives the standard negation of uniform convergence: ∃ ε > 0 such that ∀ N, ∃ n ≥ N, ∃ x ∈ (−1,1), with |S_n(x) − s(x)| ≥ ε, where S_n are partial sums and s(x) = 1/(1−x). This is exactly the formal negation of uniform convergence for the sequence of partial sums converging to s on the set (−1,1).

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain: real numbers, interval Set.Ioo (−1,1) matches (−1,1).
- Uses partial sums vs. series: equivalent for uniform convergence.
- Uses ≥ ε instead of > ε in the failure witness: standard and acceptable in the negation.
- No extraneous or vacuous definitions; no auxiliary placeholders.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the statement that the geometric series does not converge uniformly on (−1,1).

- The natural language statement says: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent. The Lean theorem exactly encodes this using Mathlib's `Summable` and the definition of conditional convergence given just above.
- Minor technicality: the natural language uses indexing from n=1, while Lean sequences are from ℕ (typically starting at 0). This does not affect convergence or absolute convergence, so it is a harmless indexing shift and acceptable as a slight variation.

- h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f s means f is Frechet differentiable at every point of s.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable with continuous gradient, if ∇f is bounded on a compact subset, then f is Lipschitz on that subset.
- The Lean theorem is a slight generalization: the domain is any real normed vector space E (not just ℝ^n), and it assumes differentiability and continuity of the derivative on the subset s (rather than globally), plus compactness of s and boundedness of the derivative on s, and concludes f is Lipschitz on s. This matches the intended mathematical content for ℝ^n and is acceptable as a generalization.
- The use of fderiv and its operator norm corresponds to the gradient norm in ℝ^n → ℝ. The continuity of fderiv on s matches “∇f continuous” restricted to s (the natural statement assumes global continuity, which implies continuity on each compact subset). The compactness and boundedness assumptions align.

Checks for red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib.
- The theorem is stated with a sorry-proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def f (z : ℂ) : ℂ := (1 : ℂ) / (z ^ 2 + 1) ^ 2`
  This defines the function f: ℂ → ℂ by f(z) = 1 / (z^2 + 1)^2.

- `noncomputable def a (n : ℕ) : ℂ := if n % 2 = 0 then (((n / 2 + 1 : ℕ) : ℂ) * (-1 : ℂ) ^ (n / 2)) else (0 : ℂ)`
  This defines coefficients a_n ∈ ℂ by: if n is even, say n = 2k, then a_n = (k+1)(-1)^k; if n is odd, a_n = 0. This matches the known series for (1 + z^2)^{-2}.

- The theorem statement `f_analytic_and_power_series` asserts three things:
  (i) `AnalyticAt ℂ f 0`: f is complex-analytic at 0.
  (ii) `∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z < 1 → f z = tsum (fun n => a n * z ^ n)`: for all z with |z| < 1, f(z) equals the power series sum Σ a_n z^n.
  (iii) `∀ z : ℂ, 1 < Complex.abs z → ¬ Summable (fun n => a n * z ^ n)`: for all z with |z| > 1, the series Σ a_n z^n does not converge. This identifies the radius of convergence as exactly 1.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show f(x) = 1/(x^2+1)^2 is analytic, find a power series at 0, and its radius of convergence. The Lean code treats f as a complex function and proves analyticity at 0, provides explicit coefficients a_n for the power series centered at 0, and characterizes convergence for |z|<1 and divergence for |z|>1, thereby identifying the radius as 1. The series coefficients match the known expansion 1/(1+z^2)^2 = Σ_{k≥0} (k+1)(-1)^k z^{2k} (and zero for odd n).

3) Final comparison:
- The only difference is that the Lean formalization is over ℂ rather than ℝ, which is a standard and acceptable generalization for an analyticity question and yields the same series and radius. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary definitions are legitimate and correctly encode the intended coefficients. The theorem statement matches the mathematical meaning and even provides a precise characterization of the radius via convergence/divergence.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language problem.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and openings are standard.
- The theorem considers a complex function f : ℂ → ℂ, a formal multilinear power series p : FormalMultilinearSeries ℂ ℂ ℂ, a real radius R > 1, with hypotheses:
  - hR : 1 < R
  - h_analytic : AnalyticOn ℂ f (ball 0 R) (i.e., f is holomorphic on an open ball of radius R around 0, hence on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk)
  - h_has : HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0 (i.e., f has a power series expansion p at 0)
  - h0 : f 0 ≠ 0
- Conclusion: There exists C : ℝ such that for all m : ℕ and z : ℂ with |z| ≤ 1,
  |1 - ∑_{k=0}^m (p.coeff k / f(0)) z^k| ≤ C |z|^(m+1).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Hypotheses match in spirit: the natural statement assumes f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and f(0) ≠ 0. The Lean code uses an explicit R > 1 and analyticity on ball(0, R), which is a standard formalization of ""neighborhood of the closed unit disk."" The extra assumption HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0 is consistent (it follows from analyticity), though redundant.
- Conclusion aims to bound the Taylor remainder of the normalized series 1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (f^{(k)}(0) / (k! f(0))) z^k by C |z|^(m+1) for |z| ≤ 1. This exactly matches the natural statement if the coefficients used are f^{(k)}(0)/k!.

Critical mismatch in the Lean code:
- The code uses p.coeff k in place of the scalar coefficient f^{(k)}(0)/k!. In Mathlib, for HasFPowerSeriesAt f p 0 with domain ℂ, p.coeff k is a continuous multilinear map (Fin k → ℂ) →L[ℂ] ℂ. The scalar corresponding to f^{(k)}(0)/k! is obtained by evaluating p.coeff k at the k-tuple all equal to 1 (or by using the known identification in one dimension), and the contribution at z is p.coeff k (fun _ => z), not (p.coeff k) * z^k. Thus the code’s summand fun k => (p.coeff k / f 0) * z ^ k is not the same as fun k => ((f^{(k)}(0) / k!) / f 0) * z^k, unless one inserts the appropriate evaluation of p.coeff k.
- Therefore, the Lean formulation does not correctly encode the derivatives f^{(k)}(0)/k! and misses the necessary evaluation of the multilinear map at (z, …, z) (or extraction of the scalar coefficient via evaluation at (1, …, 1)).

Other remarks:
- Aside from this central coefficient issue, the quantifiers, domain (|z| ≤ 1), and existence of a constant C align with the natural statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the theorem is stated with real Mathlib predicates. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is fine for translation auditing.

Final check:
- The main mathematical content differs because p.coeff k is not the scalar f^{(k)}(0)/k! used in the natural statement, and the code does not perform the necessary evaluation of the multilinear coefficient. Hence the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {K : Type*} [NormedField K]`: We work over a normed field K.
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedAddCommGroup Y]`: X and Y are normed additive commutative groups.
- `[NormedSpace K X] [NormedSpace K Y]`: X and Y are normed vector spaces over K.
- The theorem: `theorem linear_map.bounded_implies_continuous (A : X →ₗ[K] Y) (C : ℝ) (h_bound : ∀ x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖) : Continuous (A : X → Y)` states: If A is a linear map from X to Y over K, and there exists a real constant C such that for all x, the norm of A x is bounded by C times the norm of x, then A is continuous as a function from X to Y.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Natural language: Let X, Y be normed vector spaces. Show that if A ∈ L(X,Y) is linear and bounded, then A is continuous. Here, ""bounded"" explicitly means there exists C with ‖A x‖ ≤ C‖x‖ for all x. The Lean statement exactly assumes linearity (A : X →ₗ[K] Y) and boundedness via a specified C and inequality, and concludes continuity. This matches the standard result.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- The Lean theorem quantifies a particular constant C witnessing boundedness rather than merely stating existence; this is the usual formalization and is logically equivalent for the implication to continuity.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. All typeclass assumptions match ""normed vector spaces"".
- Therefore, the formal statement is faithful to the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is legitimate and faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem bounded_uniformly_continuous_on_riemann {a b : ℝ} {f : ℝ → ℝ}
  (hbound : ∃ M, ∀ x ∈ Icc a b, |f x| ≤ M) (huc : UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) :
  IntervalIntegrable f volume a b := by sorry`

Natural language rendering:
- Let a, b be real numbers and f : ℝ → ℝ a function. Assume f is bounded on the closed interval [a, b], i.e., there exists M such that for all x ∈ [a, b], |f x| ≤ M. Also assume f is uniformly continuous on [a, b]. Then f is interval integrable with respect to the Lebesgue measure (denoted `volume`) on the interval from a to b; that is, f is Lebesgue integrable over [a, b] (in Mathlib terminology `IntervalIntegrable f volume a b`).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement asks to prove: If f : [a, b] → ℝ is bounded and uniformly continuous, then f is Riemann integrable.
- The Lean conclusion proves Lebesgue integrability on [a, b] (`IntervalIntegrable f volume a b`), not Riemann integrability. In Mathlib, `IntervalIntegrable` is a measure-theoretic (Lebesgue/Bochner) notion, not the Riemann integrability predicate. While every Riemann integrable function is Lebesgue integrable, the converse is false; so the Lean statement is strictly weaker than the original claim.
- The hypotheses (boundedness and uniform continuity on [a, b]) match the natural statement (with f globally defined on ℝ but only used on [a, b], which is standard and acceptable). There are no vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: bounded + uniformly continuous on [a, b] ⇒ Riemann integrable.
- Lean: bounded + uniformly continuous on [a, b] ⇒ Lebesgue integrable (`IntervalIntegrable`).
- These are different. The Lean code proves a weaker property than claimed in the natural language statement. Hence the translation is not faithful, despite being close in spirit.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Imports and openings: `import Mathlib`, `open Set`, `open MeasureTheory`, `open scoped ENNReal` set up the environment with sets, measure theory, and extended nonnegative reals.
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We work in ℝ^n, represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`.
- `def is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles (m : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal) : Prop := True`: This is a placeholder predicate stating that a set function `m` is the outer measure obtained by coverings by countably many open rectangles, but it is defined to be `True`. This is vacuous and does not impose any real condition on `m`.
- `def closed_rectangle (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := Set.Icc a b`: The closed rectangle [a, b] in ℝ^n is modeled as the product interval `Icc a b` (coordinatewise closed interval), which matches the standard definition when `a i ≤ b i` for all i.
- Theorem `outer_measure_eq_volume_on_closed_rectangle`: For any set function `m : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal`, assuming `hm : is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles m` (which, due to the placeholder, is automatically true for any `m`), and given `a, b` with `hab : ∀ i, a i ≤ b i`, the code claims `m (closed_rectangle a b) = Finset.univ.prod (fun i => ENNReal.ofReal (b i - a i))`. The right-hand side is the product of the side lengths converted to `ENNReal`, i.e., the standard volume of the rectangle.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement specifies a particular outer measure `m^*` on ℝ^n, defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles, and asserts that for any closed rectangle `R`, `m^*(R) = V(R)` (its volume).
- The code intends to formalize this by introducing a predicate that `m` is “the” outer measure from open rectangles, and then asserting the equality of `m` on closed rectangles to the product of side lengths.

Discrepancies and issues:
- Critical: The predicate `is_outer_measure_from_open_rectangles` is defined as `True`, so it imposes no restriction on `m`. Consequently, the theorem statement effectively claims this volume formula for every set function `m : Set → ENNReal`, which is far stronger and false in general. This makes the formal statement not faithful to the natural language statement.
- The theorem has a proof placeholder `by sorry`, but per the task, we do not require proofs. The issue is the vacuous auxiliary definition.
- The modeling of ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ` and a closed rectangle as `Icc a b` with the assumption `hab : ∀ i, a i ≤ b i` is standard and fine.
- Using `ENNReal.ofReal (b i - a i)` and taking the product to represent volume is consistent with `V(R)` in the natural statement (modulo coercions to `ENNReal`).

Final judgment:
- Because the key auxiliary predicate is vacuous, the code does not faithfully encode the hypothesis “m is the outer measure defined by coverings by open rectangles.” Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.
- If the placeholder predicate were replaced by a legitimate definition tying `m` to the standard outer measure from open rectangles, the theorem statement would be faithful. Thus, it fits the rubric category where vacuous definitions break faithfulness but could be fixed to become faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The theorem `complex_local_inverse` states: For a function f : ℂ → ℂ, a point z0 : ℂ, assuming (i) f is analytic at z0 (`AnalyticAt ℂ f z0`) and (ii) the complex derivative at z0 is nonzero (`deriv f z0 ≠ 0`), there exist open sets U, V ⊆ ℂ and a function g : ℂ → ℂ such that:
  - U and V are open, z0 ∈ U, and f z0 ∈ V.
  - f maps U onto V (f '' U = V).
  - g is a two-sided inverse between U and V: for all z ∈ U, g (f z) = z, and for all w ∈ V, f (g w) = w.
  - g is analytic on V, i.e., for all w ∈ V, `AnalyticAt ℂ g w`.
  From the equalities and f '' U = V, it follows that g(V) ⊆ U and f|_U and g|_V are inverse maps between U and V.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: If f : ℂ → ℂ is analytic and f′(z0) ≠ 0, then f is a local diffeomorphism at z0; that is, there are neighborhoods U of z0 and V of f(z0) and a local inverse g : V → ℂ which is analytic, with f and g inverse on those neighborhoods.
- The Lean statement matches this: it produces open neighborhoods U of z0 and V of f z0, with f mapping U bijectively onto V and an analytic inverse g on V satisfying the mutual inverse identities. The requirement that g be analytic on V is expressed as ∀ w ∈ V, AnalyticAt ℂ g w (equivalent to AnalyticOn ℂ g V as V is open). The inverse identities ensure bijectivity and that g(V) ⊆ U.

Step 3: Check for differences.
- Hypotheses: The natural statement says “f is analytic” (often meaning on a neighborhood or globally), while the Lean code assumes only `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0`. In Mathlib, `AnalyticAt` is a local property strong enough to yield analyticity in a neighborhood; this is a slight generalization (weaker hypothesis) but is standard and acceptable for a local result.
- Conclusion: The Lean code provides the full local biholomorphism structure (open sets, two-sided inverse, analyticity of the inverse), which matches “local diffeomorphism at z0” with analytic inverse.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary fake constructs. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions (AnalyticAt, deriv, Set.image, IsOpen), and the structure of the conclusion is faithful.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization (slightly generalized on the hypothesis in a standard, acceptable way) of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def ConditionallyConvergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)` defines a real series a to be conditionally convergent exactly when the series ∑ a n converges (Summable a) and the series of absolute values ∑ |a n| does not converge (¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)). This matches the standard definition.
- `theorem cond_conv_of_convergent_not_abs ... : ConditionallyConvergent a` states: if a real series a is summable and its series of absolute values is not summable, then a is conditionally convergent. This is a direct restatement of the intended implication using the defined predicate.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Suppose ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges. Show that the series is conditionally convergent. The code defines ""conditionally convergent"" precisely as convergent but not absolutely convergent, and the theorem asserts exactly that under those hypotheses a is conditionally convergent. Thus, it is faithful.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean code works over ℝ (real series). The natural language statement did not specify the field; typically it could be ℝ or ℂ. This is a mild specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `Summable` and absolute value are standard Mathlib notions. The presence of `sorry` in the proof is acceptable for this task since we are auditing the translation, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The original statement requires: f is analytic (i.e., holomorphic on C), f has no zeros, and the conclusion asserts the existence of a holomorphic g with f = exp ∘ g.
- The Lean code replaces the ""f is analytic"" hypothesis by `True`, which is a vacuous placeholder and does not enforce analyticity. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate.
- The conclusion in Lean asserts existence of an arbitrary function g with f = exp ∘ g. It does not assert that g is holomorphic. This is a major mismatch: the core content of the statement is the existence of a holomorphic logarithm, not just any pointwise logarithm.
- Additionally, the theorem ends with `by sorry`, but per the auditing guidelines the presence of placeholders is a red flag; more importantly, the statement itself is already unfaithful regardless of the proof.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. Differences:
  - Analyticity of f: Original requires it; code assumes only `True` (vacuous).
  - Holomorphicity of g: Original requires g holomorphic; code makes no such claim.
  - The code is thus a weaker and incorrect formulation relative to the intended mathematical claim.

Given these issues (vacuous hypothesis and missing holomorphic condition on g), the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E]`: We work in a general normed additive commutative group E.
- `def b_of_grouping (a : ℕ → E) (m : ℕ → ℕ) (k : ℕ) : E := (Finset.Ico (m k) (m (k + 1))).sum fun i => a i`:
  This defines the k-th grouped term of the series as the finite sum of the terms a_i with indices i in the half-open interval [m k, m(k+1)). So the sequence m partitions the natural numbers into consecutive finite blocks, and b_of_grouping gives the sum over each block.
- The theorem `abs_summable.grouping_summable_tsum {a : ℕ → E} (h : Summable fun n => ‖a n‖) {m : ℕ → ℕ} (hm : StrictMono m) (hm0 : m 0 = 0) : Summable (b_of_grouping a m) ∧ tsum (b_of_grouping a m) = tsum a`:
  Assuming absolute convergence of the original series (summability of the norms), and that m is a strictly increasing sequence of cut indices with m 0 = 0 (so the blocks are consecutive, nonempty, and cover all indices), the grouped series is summable and its sum equals the sum of the original series.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Suppose ∑ a_n converges absolutely. Show that any series obtained by grouping terms also converges and has the same sum.”
- Lean: Assumes absolute convergence via `Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖)`. Models “grouping terms” by a strictly increasing cut sequence `m` with `m 0 = 0`, and defines the grouped series as block sums over consecutive intervals [m k, m(k+1)). Concludes the grouped series converges and its sum equals the original series’ sum (`tsum (b_of_grouping a m) = tsum a`).
This is precisely the standard formalization of grouping: blocks are finite, consecutive, and cover all terms; the order is preserved.

3) Final check, differences:
- Indexing starts at 0 in Lean versus 1 in the statement; this is a harmless convention change.
- The target space is a general `NormedAddCommGroup E` rather than ℝ or ℂ; this is a standard (and in mathlib, acceptable) generalization for formulating absolute convergence and regrouping. The formalization via strict monotone `m` with `m 0 = 0` accurately captures “any grouping of terms” into consecutive blocks.
- There are no vacuous placeholders: `b_of_grouping` is a genuine definition; the theorem states the desired result directly without fake definitions.
Overall, the Lean statement is a faithful (slightly generalized) formalization of the natural language claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context fixes a real finite-dimensional normed vector space `E` (with `[NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`). This is a generalization of `ℝ^n`.
- The theorem `max_on_compact_interior_has_fderiv_zero` states: for a set `K : Set E`, a function `f : E → ℝ`, and a point `x0 : E`, if
  - `hK : IsCompact K` (K is compact),
  - `hcont : ContinuousOn f K` (f is continuous on K),
  - `hdiff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K)` (f is Fréchet differentiable on the interior of K),
  - `hx0 : x0 ∈ interior K` (x0 lies in the interior of K), and
  - `hmax : ∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x0` (f attains a maximum on K at x0),
  then the conclusion is `fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0`, i.e., the Fréchet derivative of f at x0 is the zero continuous linear map.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Domain/codomain: The natural statement has `f : ℝ^n → ℝ`; the code works in any finite-dimensional real normed space `E`, which is a standard and faithful generalization of `ℝ^n`.
- Assumptions match exactly: compact K, f continuous on K, differentiable on `interior K`, x0 ∈ `interior K`, and f attains a maximum at x0 (encoded as `∀ x ∈ K, f x ≤ f x0`). Note `x0 ∈ interior K` implies `x0 ∈ K`, so the maximum condition is meaningful at x0.
- Conclusion matches: derivative at x0 equals zero. Lean uses the Fréchet derivative (`fderiv`) as a continuous linear map; asserting it equals `0` is the standard formalization of “Df(x0) = 0”. Since `hdiff` and `hx0` imply `f` is differentiable at `x0`, `fderiv ℝ f x0` indeed denotes the actual derivative (not the default 0 in the non-differentiable case).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is direct.

Final comparison:

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem tsum_of_abs_summable_rearrangement {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h : Summable fun n => |a n|) (e : ℕ ≃ ℕ) : tsum (fun n => a (e n)) = tsum a := by sorry`
  This states: Let a be a real sequence indexed by natural numbers. Assume the series is absolutely summable, i.e., the series of absolute values is summable (`Summable (fun n => |a n|)`). Let e be a bijection of ℕ (a rearrangement). Then the infinite sum (tsum) of the rearranged sequence equals the infinite sum of the original sequence.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then any rearrangement of the series has the same sum.
- The Lean theorem: For a sequence in ℝ with absolute convergence and any bijection of ℕ (rearrangement), the tsums are equal. This matches exactly the mathematical content.

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain: Lean specializes to ℝ. The natural statement is typically intended for real (or complex) series; this specialization is acceptable under the guidelines (slight specialization allowed).
- Indexing: Lean uses ℕ (typically starting at 0) whereas the natural statement starts at n=1. This is a harmless indexing shift and does not change the meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a proof hole `sorry`, which is allowed per the task (we only audit the translation of the statement).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, modulo minor, acceptable specializations.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 1 / (1 + x ^ 2)` defines the real function f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2).
- `theorem f_power_series_at_zero : ∀ x : ℝ, |x| < 1 → f x = tsum (fun n : ℕ => ((-1 : ℝ) ^ n) * x ^ (2 * n)) := by sorry` states that for every real x with |x| < 1, f x equals the infinite sum ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n x^{2n} (interpreted as a real tsum). This is the usual geometric-series-derived expansion with t = x^2, valid for |x| < 1.

2) Does the whole Lean statement faithfully capture the original statement?
- The original asks: (a) show that f is analytic, and (b) find a power series for f at 0 and its radius of convergence.
- The Lean theorem provides a correct power series representation of f at 0 on the domain |x| < 1. This addresses the “find a power series at 0” part and implicitly gives a domain where it converges to f (|x| < 1), which suggests the radius is at least 1.
- However, it does not explicitly state or prove that the radius of convergence is exactly 1. It also does not state analyticity (neither AnalyticAt at 0 nor AnalyticOn an interval nor globally), even though such an equality on an open neighborhood would imply analyticity at 0. These are missing from the formal statement.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- What matches: The series identity f(x) = ∑ (-1)^n x^{2n} for |x| < 1 is exactly the expected power series at 0.
- What is missing/different: The code does not assert that f is analytic (at 0 or on ℝ), and it does not explicitly give or justify the radius of convergence as 1. The natural language problem explicitly asks to show analyticity and to give the radius of convergence. Therefore the formalization is incomplete relative to the original tasks.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful; it captures the correct series but omits explicit analyticity and radius-of-convergence claims.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let m* be the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles. Prove finite subadditivity: m*(A ∪ B) ≤ m*(A) + m*(B) for any A, B ⊆ ℝ^n.

The Lean theorem abstracts away the specific construction of m* and even the space ℝ^n, and assumes only the key property needed to prove the inequality: countable subadditivity. Outer measures (including the Lebesgue outer measure defined via coverings by rectangles) satisfy countable subadditivity, so the Lean statement is a legitimate and slightly more general version of the requested result. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the hypothesis expresses the essential property used in the proof.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Space: ℝ^n vs arbitrary α. The Lean code is a generalization, which is acceptable.
- Nature of m*: outer measure defined via open rectangles vs an arbitrary set function satisfying countable subadditivity. Since the inequality relies only on countable subadditivity, this is an appropriate abstraction.
- Conclusion: exact same inequality m*(A ∪ B) ≤ m*(A) + m*(B).

No auxiliary definitions are vacuous; the only hypothesis is countable subadditivity, which outer measure satisfies. Hence, the translation is faithful as a general lemma capturing the intended result.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The context is functions f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ, i.e., f : ℝ^n → ℝ with the usual finite-dimensional normed structure.
- Hypotheses:
  - hfd : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U means f is C^2 on the set U (derivatives up to order 2 exist and are continuous on U).
  - hUconv : Convex ℝ U means U is convex.
- Claim:
  - For every compact set K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h ∈ ℝ^n with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, the Taylor remainder satisfies
    | f (x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  - Here fderiv ℝ f x is the Fréchet derivative (the gradient as a continuous linear map), and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the second Fréchet derivative viewed as a bilinear map (by currying), applied to (h, h). The factor 1/2 is exactly as in the standard second-order Taylor polynomial.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 and H_f (the Hessian) continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U.
- Lean hypotheses match or slightly strengthen the natural statement: ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U encapsulates f being twice continuously differentiable on U, which in particular implies the Hessian is continuous on U. The convexity of U is included explicitly.
- The conclusion in Lean is the usual quantitative uniform Taylor estimate: for each compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that the remainder is bounded by ε‖h‖^2, uniformly over x ∈ K for all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U. This is precisely the content of uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets.

Potential nuances and their impact:
- The code uses the ambient derivative fderiv ℝ f x rather than a within-derivative. Since f : ℝ^n → ℝ is globally defined and ContDiffOn ℝ 2 on U, this is a standard formalization choice and matches the intended Hessian/gradient at x. The additional condition x + h ∈ U (together with convexity) ensures the segment from x to x + h stays in U, which is a common technical condition in rigorous statements when U is not assumed open.
- The norm on (Fin n → ℝ) in Mathlib is equivalent to the Euclidean norm; for big-O type statements this is immaterial.
- The hypotheses are not weaker than the natural statement; if anything, they align well (C^2 on U implies Hessian continuity on U). The requirement K ⊆ U and the uniform estimate over K is exactly “uniform on compact subsets of U.”

Final check:
- The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language theorem. It uses standard Mathlib notions (ContDiffOn, fderiv) with no vacuous placeholders. There are no auxiliary fake definitions. The quantified statement matches the intended uniform second-order Taylor expansion on compact subsets of U.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Global context: R is a commutative ring (CommRing R), n is a finite index type (Fintype n) with decidable equality. Matrices are over R with size n×n.

- Theorem det_eq_zero_iff_cols_linear_dependent (A : Matrix n n R) : A.det = 0 ↔ ¬ LinearIndependent R (A.col)
  Translation: For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, det(A) = 0 if and only if the family of columns of A is linearly dependent.

- Theorem det_ne_zero_iff_cols_linear_independent (A : Matrix n n R) : A.det ≠ 0 ↔ LinearIndependent R (A.col)
  Translation: For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, det(A) ≠ 0 if and only if the family of columns of A is linearly independent.

- Theorem det_eq_zero_iff_rows_linear_dependent (A : Matrix n n R) : A.det = 0 ↔ ¬ LinearIndependent R (A.transpose.col)
  Translation: For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, det(A) = 0 if and only if the family of rows of A is linearly dependent (implemented as columns of Aᵀ).

- Theorem det_ne_zero_iff_rows_linear_independent (A : Matrix n n R) : A.det ≠ 0 ↔ LinearIndependent R (A.transpose.col)
  Translation: For an n×n matrix A over a commutative ring R, det(A) ≠ 0 if and only if the family of rows of A is linearly independent.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If det(A) = 0, then the columns (or rows) are linearly dependent; if det(A) ≠ 0, then the columns (or rows) are linearly independent. This is the standard result in linear algebra, typically over a field (or at least an integral domain).

- The Lean code asserts stronger equivalences (↔) rather than implications (→), which is acceptable as a strengthening if the base ring assumptions are correct.

- Critical discrepancy: The Lean code assumes only [CommRing R]. Over a general commutative ring with zero divisors, the implications “det(A) ≠ 0 ⇒ columns are linearly independent” and the equivalences stated are false in general. Counterexample: Over R = Z/4Z, A = [2] has det(A) = 2 ≠ 0 but the single column (2) is not linearly independent since 2·2 = 0. Thus, the code’s theorems are not valid under the given assumptions.

- The natural language problem did not specify the coefficient field/ring, but in standard linear algebra contexts it is over a field. A faithful formalization should assume [Field R] (or at least [IsDomain R]). The current formalization over [CommRing R] is too general and thereby incorrect.

- All auxiliary components are legitimate (no vacuous definitions), and the structure aligns well otherwise (columns and rows both addressed), and no resort to Laplace is encoded. However, the main mismatch in scalar assumptions means the formal statements do not faithfully capture the intended theorem.

Final check: The math problems are different because the Lean code claims equivalences over all commutative rings, which is false; the intended theorem requires at least an integral domain/field. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def f (x : ℝ) := exp x * cos x`: Defines the function f(x) = e^x cos x on the reals.
- The theorem `jirilebl_ra_ch_approximate_327` asserts a conjunction:
  1) `AnalyticAt ℝ f 0`: f is real-analytic at 0.
  2) There exists a sequence of coefficients `a : ℕ → ℝ` such that:
     - For all n, `a n = ∑_{m=0}^{⌊n/2⌋} (-1)^m / ((n - 2m)! (2m)!)` (this is implemented via a finite sum over `Finset.range (n / 2 + 1)` which corresponds to m = 0..⌊n/2⌋), and
     - For all x ∈ ℝ, the power series ∑ a n x^n converges (HasSum) to f x.

Assessment of mathematical meaning:
- The coefficients a n are exactly the Cauchy product coefficients obtained from e^x = ∑ x^k/k! and cos x = ∑ (-1)^m x^{2m}/(2m)!, namely a n = ∑_{m=0}^{⌊n/2⌋} (-1)^m/((n-2m)! (2m)!). So the code gives the correct Maclaurin series for f.
- The statement `∀ x : ℝ, HasSum (∑ a n x^n) (f x)` asserts that this series converges to f(x) for every real x. This implies the radius of convergence is infinite.
- `AnalyticAt ℝ f 0` confirms analyticity at 0. Given the global convergence of the Maclaurin series, this also strongly indicates entire (real-analytic on all ℝ), though the theorem only explicitly states analyticity at 0.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: prove f is analytic, find a power series at 0, and its radius of convergence. The Lean theorem:
  - Proves analyticity at 0 (which is commonly sufficient in such tasks when paired with the series at 0),
  - Provides the explicit Maclaurin series coefficients,
  - Asserts convergence for all x, which implies the radius of convergence is ∞.
- Minor difference: the theorem does not explicitly state “radius of convergence = ∞” but it asserts a stronger property (convergence for all x), which entails that radius. This is acceptable as a faithful translation.
- Another possible ambiguity is that “f is analytic” could mean globally analytic on ℝ, whereas the code states analyticity at 0 only; however, the global summation statement more than compensates, effectively capturing the intended content.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization. There are no vacuous placeholders; all notions are standard Mathlib constructs. The content matches the problem: analyticity (at least at 0), explicit power series at 0, and implicitly infinite radius of convergence.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem cauchy_product_real {a b : ℕ → ℝ}` introduces two real sequences a and b.
- Hypotheses: `ha : Summable fun n => abs (a n)` says the series ∑ |a n| is summable (absolute convergence of ∑ a_n). `hb : Summable b` says ∑ b_n converges.
- Conclusion part 1: `(Summable fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k)))` states that the series with general term `c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k * b_{n-k}` is summable (convergent). Here `Finset.range (n+1)` is {0, 1, ..., n}, and `n - k` is the usual natural subtraction, valid since k ≤ n in the range.
- Conclusion part 2: `tsum (fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))) = (tsum a) * (tsum b)` asserts that the sum of the series with terms c_n equals the product of the sums ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges, then the Cauchy product c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} defines a convergent series whose sum equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: it assumes absolute convergence of a (via `Summable (abs ∘ a)` in ℝ), convergence of b, defines the Cauchy product terms using the finite convolution sum, concludes summability of the resulting series, and gives the sum as the product of the sums.

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean version specializes to real-valued sequences (ℝ) rather than an arbitrary normed field; this is a slight specialization and acceptable.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions (Summable, tsum, Finset.sum) are standard Mathlib.
- Indexing and definition of c_n match the conventional Cauchy product definition exactly.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: “Suppose f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable and Lipschitz on a convex set U. Show that f is differentiable almost everywhere on U (Rademacher’s theorem in this context).”
- Lean statement: Assumes only that U is convex and f is Lipschitz on U, and concludes that f is differentiable almost everywhere on U w.r.t. Lebesgue measure restricted to U.
- This matches the spirit and standard content of Rademacher’s theorem: Lipschitz ⇒ differentiable a.e. The Lean statement captures exactly that, and also explicitly states the measure as `volume.restrict U`.

3) Final check for differences:
- The natural language includes an extra (and redundant) hypothesis that f is differentiable on U. The Lean code does not assume differentiability; it only assumes Lipschitz on U. This is a slight generalization (weaker hypothesis) and is in line with the usual Rademacher theorem. The conclusion “differentiable a.e. on U” is exactly what the code states.
- Everything else aligns: domain ℝ^n (modeled as (Fin n → ℝ)), scalar field ℝ, convex set U, Lipschitz on U, differentiable almost everywhere on U with respect to Lebesgue measure restricted to U.

Given the slight generalization (dropping an unnecessary differentiability hypothesis), the translation is faithful to the intended mathematical content of Rademacher’s theorem in this context.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `def is_rectangle {n : ℕ} (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True`
  This introduces a predicate `is_rectangle R` intended to mean “R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n,” but it is defined to be always True. So it is a dummy/vacuous placeholder and does not actually capture the notion of a closed rectangle.

- `def RiemannIntegrableOn {n : ℕ} (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True`
  This introduces a predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn f R` intended to mean “f is Riemann integrable on R,” but it is also defined to be always True. So it is another vacuous placeholder and does not capture Riemann integrability.

- `lemma max_min_riemann_integrable ... : RiemannIntegrableOn (fun x => max (f x) (g x)) R ∧ RiemannIntegrableOn (fun x => min (f x) (g x)) R := by sorry`
  The lemma claims: assuming `is_rectangle R` and that `f` and `g` are `RiemannIntegrableOn R`, then the functions x ↦ max(f x, g x) and x ↦ min(f x, g x) are RiemannIntegrableOn R. However, since both predicates are defined as True, the hypotheses are vacuous and the conclusions are also vacuous. The proof is a `sorry`, i.e., omitted.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The intended mathematical statement is: If R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n and f, g are Riemann integrable on R (with domain R), then max(f, g) and min(f, g) are Riemann integrable on R.
- The Lean code uses placeholders `is_rectangle` and `RiemannIntegrableOn` that are always True. This means it does not actually formalize the notions of closed rectangle or Riemann integrability. Thus, the code does not genuinely express the original statement, even though the surface structure of the lemma resembles the intended claim.
- Additionally, the functions `f, g` are typed as `(Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` rather than `R → ℝ`. This is a common alternative formulation (functions on the ambient space with an “integrable on set R” predicate), and if the integrability predicate were legitimate, this would be an acceptable variant. However, due to the dummy predicates, the formulation remains vacuous.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
- They are different. The Lean code uses vacuous, always-true predicates for the key notions, so the lemma does not assert the real mathematical content. The proof is also omitted. Even though, if one replaced the dummy predicates by legitimate Mathlib definitions, the statement would essentially match the natural language claim (up to the standard ambient-domain vs restricted-domain formulation), as it stands it is not a faithful formalization.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation. It uses vacuous definitions and provides no real content, though the final lemma shape would be faithful if those were replaced appropriately. According to the rubric, this corresponds to making up vacuous definitions but with a final statement that would be faithful if fixed, hence a grade around 6.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library.
- `theorem seq_min_nonpos {x : ℕ → ℝ} {L : ℝ} (h : Filter.Tendsto x Filter.atTop (nhds L)) : ... := by sorry`
  This states: For a real sequence `x : ℕ → ℝ` and a real number `L`, if `x` tends to `L` as `n → ∞` (formalized with filters: `Filter.Tendsto x Filter.atTop (nhds L)`), then the following holds:
  - `Filter.Tendsto (fun n => min (x n) 0) Filter.atTop (nhds (min L 0))`: the sequence `y_n = min(x_n, 0)` tends to `min(L,0)`.
  - `∧ min L 0 ≤ 0`: moreover, `min(L,0) ≤ 0`.
  The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable here for auditing faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement: Let `{x_n}` be convergent and define `y_n = min{x_n, 0}`. Show that `lim_{n→∞} y_n ≤ 0`.
The Lean code assumes convergence of `x_n` to some `L` and concludes (i) `y_n` converges to `min(L,0)` and (ii) `min(L,0) ≤ 0`. From (i) and (ii), it follows that `lim y_n = min(L,0) ≤ 0`, which is exactly the desired conclusion, and even stronger since it identifies the limit of `y_n`.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The code assumes the same hypothesis (convergence of `x_n` to some `L`) and proves a stronger result: existence and identification of `lim y_n` as `min(L,0)` plus the inequality `≤ 0`. This directly implies the requested `lim y_n ≤ 0`.
- No vacuous definitions, no placeholders beyond an omitted proof. Standard Mathlib notions are used correctly.
Therefore, the translation is faithful and slightly stronger than the natural language statement, which is acceptable.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If f is entire and nonvanishing on ℂ, then there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.
- The Lean statement uses standard Mathlib notions: `DifferentiableAt ℂ` to encode holomorphicity on ℂ at every point, and expresses `f = e^g` pointwise as `f z = Complex.exp (g z)` for all z. It asserts existence of such g holomorphic on all ℂ. This matches the intended statement exactly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only standard Mathlib predicates and functions are used.

- ""Entire"" and ""holomorphic"" are appropriately modeled by differentiability at every point.
- Nonvanishing condition is identical.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable {n : Nat}` introduces a natural number n.
- `variable {m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal}` declares m_star as an arbitrary function from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`) to extended nonnegative reals.
- The theorem `outer_measure_add_on_disjoint_open_rectangles` takes:
  - `R : Fin n → Set (Fin n → ℝ)`, a family of sets in ℝ^n indexed by `Fin n` (so there are exactly n of them);
  - `h_mstar : True` as a placeholder for “m_star is an outer measure” (vacuous, provides no information);
  - `h_rect : ∀ i : Fin n, True` as a placeholder for “each R i is an open rectangle” (also vacuous);
  - `h_disj : Pairwise (fun i j : Fin n => Disjoint (R i) (R j))`, a genuine assumption that the family is pairwise disjoint.
  The statement concludes: `m_star (⋃ i, R i) = ∑ i, m_star (R i)`.

Interpreted informally, the theorem claims: For any function m_star from sets of ℝ^n to ENNReal, and any pairwise disjoint n-tuple of sets R_i (with no actual conditions encoded about outer measure or being open rectangles), one has equality of m_star on the finite union and the sum of m_star on pieces. The placeholders `True` make the intended assumptions completely absent.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural statement: Let m^* be the (Lebesgue) outer measure on ℝ^n. If R_1,...,R_n are pairwise disjoint open rectangles, then m^*(⋃ R_k) = Σ m^*(R_k).
- Lean code issues:
  - m_star is just an arbitrary function, not specified as an outer measure (not even as `OuterMeasure` type); the only “assumption” is `True` (vacuous).
  - There is no formalization that R_i are open rectangles; again `True` placeholders.
  - The code uses the same `n` both as ambient dimension and as the number of rectangles. While the natural text also uses `n` for both (likely unintentionally), this conflation is at best confusing; however, this is minor compared to the vacuous assumptions.
  - The code does not require that m_star is specifically the Lebesgue outer measure; even if it required “outer measure,” the statement would generally be false without measurability assumptions. The natural statement implicitly relies on the special properties of Lebesgue outer measure and measurability of open rectangles.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code’s assumptions are vacuous for the key properties (outer measure, open rectangles), so the theorem statement does not faithfully capture the hypotheses of the natural language statement. Moreover, it generalizes to an arbitrary function m_star, which is a much broader and incorrect context for the claimed equality. It also omits the essential fact that we are working with the Lebesgue outer measure and measurable sets.

Additional red flags per guidelines
- The code avoids using Mathlib’s `OuterMeasure` and any notion of rectangles or openness, replacing them with `True` placeholders. This is exactly the kind of vacuous auxiliary definition that invalidates faithfulness.

Conclusion
- The translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The import of Mathlib sets up the environment with standard Mathlib definitions for polynomials and linear maps.
- The comment describes the intended goal: show the derivative operator on R[t] is linear.
- The only actual declaration is:
  noncomputable def jirilebl_ra_ch_several_vars_ders_1015 : Polynomial ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] Polynomial ℝ := by sorry
  This attempts to define a specific linear map from Polynomial ℝ to Polynomial ℝ. However, it is left as `sorry`, meaning the definition is not provided. It also does not reference the derivative operator at all; the name and comment suggest it should be the derivative, but the code does not enforce or even mention that. As written, it merely asserts the existence of some linear map (left undefined), not that the derivative is linear.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: Define D: ℝ[t] → ℝ[t] as the derivative operator and show D is a linear operator. A faithful Lean translation would define a LinearMap whose underlying function is Polynomial.derivative and prove linearity, or reference an existing linear map structure for the derivative if available in Mathlib.
- The provided code neither defines D as the derivative nor proves linearity; it gives an unspecified linear map and leaves it as `sorry`. Therefore it is not a faithful translation.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- Differences:
  - The code does not mention or use the derivative function at all.
  - The definition is incomplete (`sorry`).
  - There is no theorem or definition explicitly stating that the derivative is linear; instead there is an unnamed linear map with no link to D.
- Conclusion: The translation fails. If the `sorry` were replaced by a proper definition tying the LinearMap to Polynomial.derivative (e.g., constructing a LinearMap whose toFun is derivative and proving linearity), it would become faithful. As-is, it is not.

- The theorem `seq_max_limit_nonneg {x : ℕ → ℝ} {l : ℝ} (h : Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 l)) : Tendsto (fun n => max (x n) 0) atTop (𝓝 (max l 0)) ∧ 0 ≤ max l 0`:
  - Hypotheses: x is a real sequence and h: x_n → l as n → ∞.
  - Conclusion: The sequence y_n := max(x_n, 0) converges to max(l, 0), and moreover 0 ≤ max(l, 0).
  - This is stated with Tendsto for convergence and the conjunction gives both the exact limit and the nonnegativity of that limit.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: Let {x_n} be convergent and y_n = max{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≥ 0.
- The Lean theorem is stronger: it identifies the exact limit of y_n as max(l, 0), and separately notes that max(l, 0) ≥ 0. From these, it follows immediately that lim y_n ≥ 0. Thus it implies the original claim and is a perfectly faithful (indeed stronger) translation.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain/type: Lean uses real sequences (ℝ), which matches the usual reading of the problem; the original did not specify the target space but is standardly ℝ.
- The theorem introduces the explicit limit l of {x_n}, consistent with ""x_n convergent"" in the problem.
- The theorem asserts more (full limit result); this is acceptable as a strengthening and yields the required inequality.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem (proof omitted), relying on standard Mathlib notions like Tendsto and max.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and slightly stronger formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` introduces a natural number n, so the ambient space is `Fin n → ℝ`, i.e., ℝ^n.
- `variable (IsClosedRectangle : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate on subsets of ℝ^n, named IsClosedRectangle, but it is not defined; it could be any property.
- `variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate on a set and a function, intended to stand for Riemann integrability on a set, but again it is completely abstract and not linked to Mathlib.
- The theorem `RiemannIntegrable_on_algebra` states: for any set `R` with `hR : IsClosedRectangle R`, any functions `f, g : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`, any real `a`, if `hf : RiemannIntegrableOn R f` and `hg : RiemannIntegrableOn R g`, then `a • f`, `f + g`, and `f * g` (written pointwise) are also `RiemannIntegrableOn R`.
- The proof is `by sorry`, i.e., omitted.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is specifically about: (1) R being a closed rectangle in ℝ^n (a concrete geometric condition), and (2) Riemann integrability (a specific notion from analysis). It concludes closure under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication.
- The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s actual definitions of closed rectangles or Riemann integrability. Instead, it introduces arbitrary predicates `IsClosedRectangle` and `RiemannIntegrableOn`. Thus the theorem is not about closed rectangles or Riemann integrability at all; it is a schematic statement about any predicates with those names.
- Because these are not defined and no axioms relate them to standard notions, the statement is not a faithful formalization of the original theorem. It could be instantiated with nonsensical predicates and still typecheck.
- Additionally, there is no actual content using `hR`; it is just an unused assumption in the statement (no proof anyway), but even as a statement it does not ensure R is a closed rectangle in the analytic sense.
- The overall shape of the conclusion (closure under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication) matches the intended algebra property, but the lack of real definitions makes it non-faithful by the given guidelines.

Final check: The two problems are different. The Lean code formulates a statement about arbitrary predicates, not the Mathlib concepts of closed rectangles and Riemann integrability. Therefore it fails the faithfulness requirement.

- Neighborhood condition: Captured by an open set U containing x0 with DifferentiableOn on U. Correct.
- Continuity of derivative: Captured by ContinuousAt of the fderiv map at x0. Correct.

- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the task (we audit statements, not proofs).
- Note: The continuity assumption is redundant if one only wants differentiability at x0 since DifferentiableOn on an open neighborhood already implies differentiable at x0; however, the natural language also included this assumption, so the formalization remains faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement concerns: a closed rectangle R in R^n with one side of length 0; any bounded function f: R → R is Riemann integrable on R and the integral over R is 0. This involves definitions of closed rectangles in R^n, degenerate rectangles (one side length 0), bounded functions, Riemann integrability, and the value of the Riemann integral.

The provided Lean code does not mention rectangles, R^n, functions, boundedness, Riemann integrability, nor integrals. It merely proves `True`. Therefore it does not translate, formalize, or even reference the intended statement.

- The Lean statement encodes: existence of a positive radius r so the series converges for |z| < r; a sequence z_n ≠ 0 tending to 0; and that f(z_n) = (∑' a_k (z_n)^k) = 0 for all n; concluding a_k = 0 for all k. This matches the standard meaning of “convergent power series” (positive radius of convergence around 0) and the rest of the hypotheses and conclusion.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The Lean code uses an explicit radius r > 0 and summability inside the disk |z| < r, which is the formalization of “a convergent power series about 0.”
- It does not define f separately but uses the tsum expression directly in the root condition; this is equivalent for the purposes of the statement.
- All auxiliary notions (Summable, tsum, Tendsto) are standard Mathlib; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- `theorem graph_of_continuous_has_measure_zero {n : ℕ} (U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : ContinuousOn f U) : ... = 0`:
  • We fix a natural number n and consider ℝ^n represented as the function space `(Fin n → ℝ)`.
  • `U` is a subset of ℝ^n, given as `Set (Fin n → ℝ)`.
  • `f` is a function from ℝ^n to ℝ (total function), but we assume only `ContinuousOn f U`, i.e., f is continuous on U.
  • `hU : IsOpen U` states that U is open.
  • The target set is `{p : (Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ | p.1 ∈ U ∧ p.2 = f p.1}` viewed as a subset of `(Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ`, i.e., ℝ^n × ℝ ≅ ℝ^{n+1}. This is precisely the graph of f over U.
  • The conclusion `MeasureTheory.volume (...) = 0` asserts that the Lebesgue measure (volume) of this graph subset in ℝ^{n+1} is zero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊂ ℝ^n open; f: U → ℝ continuous; G = {(x, f(x)) ∈ ℝ^{n+1} : x ∈ U}; show G has measure zero in ℝ^{n+1}.
- The Lean statement models ℝ^n as `(Fin n → ℝ)` and ℝ^{n+1} as `(Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ`, which is standard and equivalent.
- The graph set `{p | p.1 ∈ U ∧ p.2 = f p.1}` is exactly the graph G.
- The measure used is `MeasureTheory.volume`, i.e., Lebesgue measure on the ambient Euclidean space; concluding it equals 0 matches “has measure zero”.
- The only minor formalization difference is that Lean takes `f : ℝ^n → ℝ` and assumes `ContinuousOn f U`, instead of typing f with domain U (as a subtype). This is a standard equivalent way to formalize “f: U → ℝ is continuous”.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain of f: natural language has f: U → ℝ; Lean has f: ℝ^n → ℝ with continuity only on U. This is a harmless and faithful formalization and in fact a slight generalization that still proves the exact desired statement about the graph over U.
- Representation of ℝ^n and ℝ^{n+1}: Lean’s `(Fin n → ℝ)` and product with ℝ matches the mathematical identification.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorem states precisely the desired conclusion.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language theorem.

  Statement: If each f_n is continuous and f_n → f uniformly on each [−k, k], then f is continuous on ℝ. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement itself matches the intended theorem.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language defines “converges uniformly on compact subsets” as convergence uniformly on every [−k, k] (k ∈ ℕ). The Lean definition conv_uniform_on_compacts exactly encodes that, with the usual ε–N quantifiers for uniform convergence on each [−k, k].
- The theorem states: if each f_n is continuous and f_n → f uniformly on compact subsets, then f is continuous on ℝ. This matches the natural language theorem.
- Domain and codomain are ℝ → ℝ throughout, consistent with the statement.
- Although in general “on compact subsets” could mean all compact sets, on ℝ the given definition via [−k, k] is standard and equivalent because every compact set is contained in some [−k, k], and uniform convergence on a larger set implies uniform convergence on its subsets.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Yes. The auxiliary definition is legitimate and non-vacuous, and the theorem statement matches exactly the natural language claim: continuity of the uniform-on-compact-limit of continuous functions.
- The presence of a proof hole (sorry) does not affect the translation fidelity per the instructions; the properties defined are meaningful and not placeholders.

The proof is omitted (sorry), but for auditing we only care about the statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: U ⊂ ℝ^2 is a connected open set; f: U → ℝ is harmonic (C^2 with f_xx + f_yy = 0 on U); if f attains a maximum at p ∈ U then f is constant on U.
- Lean code matches the structural hypotheses: U is a subset of ℝ×ℝ (ℝ^2), IsOpen U, IsConnected U, p ∈ U, and “attains a maximum at p” is captured by ∀ x ∈ U, f x ≤ f p. The conclusion “f is constant on U” is expressed as ∀ x ∈ U, f x = f p.
- Critical issue: The definition of harmonic_on is vacuous (True) and does not encode harmonicity. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be legitimate and faithful. The statement becomes strictly stronger than the original (it asserts the maximum principle for any function, since hf is always available). Thus, the translation is not faithful.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences
- Main discrepancy: harmonic_on is defined as True rather than the actual harmonic condition (C^2 and Laplacian zero). This makes the hypothesis meaningless and the theorem state a false general principle for arbitrary functions. No other vacuous placeholders are present, and other components (open, connected, maximum attained, constant conclusion) match correctly.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous predicate for harmonic_on. If harmonic_on were properly defined to match the natural language harmonic condition, the theorem statement would be faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.

- `theorem linear_map_differentiable_and_fderiv (A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ...`:
  For any continuous linear map A from (Fin n → ℝ) (i.e., ℝ^n) to (Fin m → ℝ) (i.e., ℝ^m) and any point x in ℝ^n, the following holds:
  - `DifferentiableAt ℝ (A : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin m → ℝ)) x`: the function underlying A is differentiable at x.
  - `fderiv ℝ (A : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin m → ℝ)) x = A`: the Fréchet derivative at x is equal to A itself (as a continuous linear map).
- `by sorry`: Proof omitted.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Natural statement: Let A : ℝ^n → ℝ^m be a linear operator. Prove A is differentiable at every x ∈ ℝ^n and DA(x) = A (as a linear map).

The Lean statement says: For any A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ) and any x, A is differentiable at x and its derivative equals A. Here (Fin n → ℝ) is the standard model of ℝ^n, and fderiv returns a continuous linear map, so equality is exactly as desired. The only apparent specialization is that A is assumed to be a continuous linear map rather than merely linear. In finite-dimensional spaces (ℝ^n, ℝ^m) all linear maps are continuous, so this is not a real restriction in this context. The universal quantification over x matches “at every x”.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain/codomain representation: (Fin n → ℝ) vs ℝ^n — standard and faithful.
- Linear vs continuous linear: In ℝ^n → ℝ^m, all linear maps are continuous, so using ContinuousLinearMap is equivalent here.
- Derivative object type: fderiv returns a continuous linear map; the statement says “as a linear map” — equality as continuous linear maps is even slightly stronger and thus faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem with an omitted proof, which is acceptable per the task instructions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- The ambient space ℝ^n is represented as `Fin n → ℝ`, which is the standard formalization in Lean.
- The conclusion quantifies over x, y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], matching the natural-language statement.
- The code assumes f is defined on all of ℝ^n rather than just on U, but restricts the convexity assumption and the quantified points to U. This is a standard and acceptable formalization of “f : U → ℝ” in Lean, and does not change the content of the inequality for points in U.
- Extra hypotheses: `IsOpen U` and `DifferentiableOn ℝ f U` are included but not used for the inequality; they match the natural-language context and do not detract from faithfulness.

3) Final comparison:
- Both the natural-language statement and the Lean theorem assert: If f is convex on U, then for any x, y ∈ U and t ∈ [0,1], the convexity inequality holds. The domain/codomain, quantifiers, and inequality match exactly (with Lean’s vector-space notation).
- Minor formalization differences (global definition of f, inclusion of differentiability/open assumptions) are standard and do not change the statement’s meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are from Mathlib.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `variable {X : Type _}`: We work over an arbitrary type X, not specifically ℝ^n.
- `variable (R : Set X) (f g : X → ℝ)`: R is a subset of X; f and g are functions from X to ℝ (not from R to ℝ). The intended restriction to R is handled by later hypotheses.
- `variable (RiemannIntegrable_on : ∀ (R : Set X), (X → ℝ) → Prop)`: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “f is Riemann integrable on R.” This is not a Mathlib definition; it is an arbitrary predicate parameter.
- `variable (RiemannIntegral : ∀ (R : Set X), (X → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Introduces a placeholder function for the Riemann integral over R. Again, not Mathlib; it’s an arbitrary function parameter.
- `variable (outer_measure_zero : Set X → Prop)`: Placeholder predicate for “outer measure zero.” Not Mathlib’s notion; arbitrary parameter.
- `variable (E : Set X)`: A set E ⊆ X.
- `variable (E_closed : Prop)`: An unused placeholder stating “E is closed,” but it’s just a Prop variable and not used in the theorem.
- Theorem `rint_eq_of_equal_off_null`:
  Hypotheses:
  - `hE_sub : E ⊆ R`: E is a subset of R.
  - `h_outer_zero : outer_measure_zero E`: E has outer measure zero (w.r.t. the placeholder predicate).
  - `h_eq : ∀ x, x ∈ R \ E → f x = g x`: f = g on R \ E.
  - `hf : RiemannIntegrable_on R f`, `hg : RiemannIntegrable_on R g`: f and g are Riemann integrable on R (w.r.t. the placeholder predicate).
  Conclusion:
  - `RiemannIntegral R f = RiemannIntegral R g`: the integrals coincide (w.r.t. the placeholder functional).
  The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement is specifically about R ⊆ ℝ^n being a closed rectangle, and f, g : R → ℝ Riemann integrable. The Lean code uses an arbitrary type X and an arbitrary subset R ⊆ X, with no structure reflecting ℝ^n or the closed-rectangle condition. This is a generalization of the domain assumptions, not a faithful encoding of them.
- The original statement assumes the existence of a closed set E ⊆ R with outer measure zero such that f = g on R \ E. In the Lean code, E is a subset with outer_measure_zero (placeholder), and the “closed” aspect is represented only by an unused hypothesis `E_closed : Prop`, which is not part of the theorem’s hypotheses and is never used. So the Lean theorem does not require E to be closed at all. This is a further generalization and also indicates an inconsistent or incomplete translation (since the variable `E_closed` is present but not tied to the theorem).
- Crucially, the Lean code does not use Mathlib’s actual definitions for Riemann integrability, the Riemann integral, or outer measure zero. Instead, it introduces arbitrary placeholder predicates and a function. This is a major red flag per the guidelines: the formalization is not tied to the real mathematical concepts from Mathlib and is therefore vacuous in the sense of not committing to the intended semantics.
- The functional types also differ: the statement has f, g : R → ℝ, while the code has f, g : X → ℝ and checks equalities via membership in R \ E. This is a reasonable technical choice, but given the other issues, it does not rescue faithfulness.

Final check:
- The core shape “if f = g off a null set E ⊆ R and both are Riemann integrable on R, then the integrals are equal” is present. However, the code uses arbitrary placeholders for all the key notions and ignores the structural assumptions (ℝ^n, closed rectangle, and the closedness of E). The presence of vacuous placeholders and the unused `E_closed` violate the faithfulness requirement. Even if the placeholders were replaced by real Mathlib definitions, the theorem would still be a generalization (no requirement that R is a closed rectangle, no use of E being closed, arbitrary ambient type), which might be acceptable as a slight generalization—but the placeholders themselves make it fail under the given guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful. It makes up vacuous definitions; if fixed, the end statement would be close conceptually (indeed slightly more general), but as written it fails the faithfulness requirement.

The natural language statement is: In a metric space, S is open iff for every p in S there is ε > 0 such that B(p, ε) ⊆ S. Here B(p, ε) denotes the open ball. The Lean statement matches exactly: it works in an arbitrary metric space, uses the open ball `Metric.ball`, requires ε > 0, and asserts inclusion `⊆` into S. This is the standard characterization of open sets in metric spaces.

- `variable {n : Type _} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n]`: The index type n is a finite type with decidable equality; this models an n-by-n matrix where `Fintype.card n` is the dimension.
- `theorem det_of_cofactor_matrix (A : Matrix n n R) (B : Matrix n n R) (h : B = A.adjugate) : B.det = A.det ^ (Fintype.card n - 1) := by sorry`:
  This states: For an n-by-n matrix A over R, and a matrix B equal to the adjugate of A (i.e., `B = A.adjugate`), the determinant of B equals det(A) raised to the power `Fintype.card n - 1`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “If A is an n-by-n matrix and B is the matrix of cofactors of A, show that det(B) = det(A)^{n-1}.”
- In Mathlib, `A.adjugate` is the (classical) adjugate matrix, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Many texts conflate “matrix of cofactors” with “adjugate,” and even if one distinguishes them, taking determinants eliminates the transpose issue because det(transpose M) = det M. Thus, whether B is taken to be the cofactor matrix or the adjugate, the determinant identity is the same. The Lean statement assumes `B = A.adjugate`, which is fully faithful to the intended theorem.
- The exponent appears as `Fintype.card n - 1`, which corresponds exactly to “n − 1” in the natural-language statement for an n-by-n matrix.
- The ambient generality (commutative ring R, general finite index type n) is a standard generalization and does not alter the content.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. The only subtlety is the possible transpose between ""cofactor matrix"" and ""adjugate""; but determinants are invariant under transpose, so the equality claimed is unaffected. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the code states precisely the expected result under the standard Mathlib naming/conventions.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural-language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem dirichlet_test_bounded_partial_sums (x seq : ℕ → ℝ)` introduces two real sequences x_n and seq_n (λ_n) indexed by natural numbers starting at 0.
- `(h_bound : ∃ M:ℝ, ∀ n, |(Finset.range (n+1)).sum (fun i => x i)| ≤ M)` says: there exists a real M such that for all n, the absolute value of the partial sum ∑_{i=0}^n x_i is bounded by M. This is the “bounded partial sums” assumption for the series of x_n.
- `(hseq : Tendsto seq atTop (nhds (0 : ℝ)))` says: seq_n → 0 as n → ∞. This corresponds to λ_n → 0.
- `(hvar : Summable fun n => |seq (n+1) - seq n|)` says: the series ∑ |seq_{n+1} − seq_n| converges. This is the bounded variation-type hypothesis on λ_n.
- Conclusion: `Summable fun n => seq n * x n` says that the series ∑ seq_n x_n converges.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Given a series ∑ x_n with bounded partial sums, λ_n → 0, and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges, then ∑ λ_n x_n converges.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes these assumptions and conclusion over ℝ. The only minor differences are:
  - Indexing starts at 0 in Lean vs 1 in the natural statement. This is a standard harmless shift; bounded partial sums and convergence are unaffected by finite shifts (one may take x_0 = 0 if needed).
  - The codomain is ℝ; the natural statement did not specify a field but is commonly over ℝ or ℂ. This is a harmless specialization.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib objects (Summable, Tendsto, Finset.range sums, etc.). The proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing per instructions.

3) Final check: The two problems are the same. The Lean theorem precisely formalizes the given Dirichlet-type test with bounded partial sums and a sequence of bounded variation tending to 0, concluding convergence of ∑ λ_n x_n. Only trivial indexing and real-valued specialization differences exist and are acceptable.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib / noncomputable section / open Finset: Environment setup.
- def f (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x / (1 + (↑n * x) ^ 2)
  This defines f_n(x) = x / (1 + (n x)^2) for n ∈ ℕ, x ∈ ℝ. This matches the given f_n definition.
- def g (a : ℕ → ℚ) (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
    Finset.sum (range n) (fun k => (1 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ) ^ (k + 1) * f n (x - (a (k + 1) : ℝ)))
  This defines g_n(x) as the finite sum over k = 0, …, n-1 of 2^{-(k+1)} f_n(x - a_{k+1}), i.e., equivalently ∑_{j=1}^n 2^{-j} f_n(x - a_j). Here a: ℕ → ℚ is a sequence (intended as an enumeration), and we cast a(j) to ℝ in the argument.
- theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_seq_funcs_1442 (a : ℕ → ℚ) : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : ℝ, |g a n x| ≤ ε := by sorry
  This states that for any sequence a: ℕ → ℚ, g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ: for every ε > 0 there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ ℝ, |g_n(x)| ≤ ε. The proof is omitted, but the statement is clear.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- The original defines f_n(x) = x/(1+(n x)^2); the Lean f matches exactly.
- The original defines g_n(x) = ∑_{k=1}^n 2^{-k} f_n(x - a_k); the Lean g matches via the range/shifted index (k+1), which is equivalent.
- The original assumes {a_k} is an enumeration of ℚ; the Lean theorem takes an arbitrary a : ℕ → ℚ and does not require surjectivity. This is a slight generalization (stronger claim) because the uniform convergence conclusion does not actually require a to enumerate all rationals.
- The conclusion “g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ” is formalized as ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x, |g a n x| ≤ ε, which is the standard definition of uniform convergence to 0.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- They are essentially the same. The only difference is that the Lean statement does not enforce that a enumerates ℚ; it holds for any sequence a: ℕ → ℚ. This is a harmless and even stronger generalization, fully consistent with the intended result. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; f and g are genuine, and the theorem statement matches the uniform convergence claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful (indeed slightly stronger but acceptable per the guidelines).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib.
- def cauchy_prod (a b : ℕ → ℝ) : ℕ → ℝ := fun n => Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => a k * b (n - k))
  This defines the sequence cauchy_prod a b by cauchy_prod a b n = ∑_{k=0}^n a k * b (n - k), i.e., the Cauchy product convolution for real sequences.

    sorry
  This theorem states: If a and b are absolutely summable real sequences (Summable |a n| and Summable |b n|), then the Cauchy product sequence cauchy_prod a b is summable, and the sum of the Cauchy product equals the product of the sums: tsum (cauchy_prod a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b). The proof is omitted with sorry, but we only audit the statement.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
Natural language: For absolutely convergent series ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n, the series ∑ c_n with c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} converges absolutely and ∑ c_n = (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n).

- Hypotheses: Lean uses Summable |a n| and Summable |b n| (absolute convergence) over ℝ. This matches the hypotheses (a mild specialization to ℝ, which is acceptable).
- Definition of c_n: Lean’s cauchy_prod exactly matches c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}.
- Conclusions:
  • Natural language demands that ∑ c_n converges absolutely (i.e., Summable |c_n|).
  • Lean theorem concludes only Summable (cauchy_prod a b), i.e., convergence, not necessarily absolute convergence.
  • Both conclude the product of sums identity tsum (cauchy_prod a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b).

Thus, the Lean statement is weaker than the natural language statement because it does not assert absolute convergence of the Cauchy product, only convergence.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- They are not the same: the Lean code omits the absolute convergence of the Cauchy product. Everything else (definitions and the sum equality) matches. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the auxiliary definition is legitimate.

Given this single but substantive mismatch (lack of absolute convergence in the conclusion), the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- import Mathlib: Use mathlib, the standard mathematical library.
- def Riemann_integrable_on (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True: Define a predicate “Riemann integrable on [a,b]” but make it identically True (a vacuous placeholder, not the real definition).
- def Riemann_integral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0: Define the “Riemann integral of f on [a,b]” to be always 0 (vacuous placeholder, not the real integral).
- def Uniform_on (f_n : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True: Define “uniform convergence on [a,b]” as True (vacuous placeholder).
- open Filter: Open the Filter namespace to talk about limits.
- theorem uniform_limit_of_riemann_integrable ...: The statement says: If each f_n is Riemann integrable on [a,b] (using the stub predicate) and f_n converges uniformly to f on [a,b] (using the stub predicate), then f is Riemann integrable on [a,b] and the map n ↦ Riemann_integral (f_n n) a b tends to the pure value Riemann_integral f a b. In words: f is Riemann integrable and ∫_a^b f = lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n. The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The overall form of the theorem (hypotheses and conclusion) matches the natural language theorem: it asserts integrability of the limit and convergence of integrals under uniform convergence on [a,b]. The use of functions ℝ → ℝ together with a predicate “Riemann_integrable_on f a b” is a standard formalization of functions defined on [a,b]. The limit is expressed via Tendsto to a constant filter value, which corresponds to lim ∫ f_n = ∫ f.

However, the key predicates and functions are defined as vacuous placeholders:
- Riemann_integrable_on is always True,
- Riemann_integral is always 0,
- Uniform_on is always True.
Thus the statement becomes trivial and does not capture the intended mathematical content. This violates the guideline requiring legitimate, faithful auxiliary definitions; these are vacuous and not mathlib’s real notions. The presence of sorry in the theorem means the proof is omitted; while that may still compile under non-strict settings, it further indicates the result is not established.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
- Intended statement: A genuine theorem about Riemann integrability and uniform convergence on [a,b], concluding integrability of the limit and convergence of integrals.
- Lean statement with placeholders: A vacuous theorem that, given trivially true hypotheses, concludes trivially true integrability and a limit statement about constant zero integrals, since Riemann_integral is defined to be 0. Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully represent the mathematical content.

Given that the auxiliary definitions are vacuous, the translation fails. If those placeholders were replaced by legitimate mathlib notions (e.g., a real Riemann integral framework or appropriate interval integrals and uniform convergence predicates), the structure of the theorem statement would be faithful to the natural language.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Ambient space: points are functions Fin n → ℝ, i.e., ℝ^n.
- Theorem inputs: U, S : Set (Fin n → ℝ); hypotheses: IsOpen U (U is open), IsCompact S (S is compact), and S ⊆ U.
- Conclusion: There exist
  - k : ℕ (a finite number of rectangles, indexed by Fin k),
  - a, b : Fin k → Fin n → ℝ (for each rectangle index j and each coordinate i, we have endpoints a j i, b j i),
  such that:
  1) ∀ j i, a j i ≤ b j i (each coordinate interval is nonempty in the closed sense),
  2) ∀ j, Set.pi univ (λ i, Icc (a j i) (b j i)) ⊆ U (each rectangle — a product of closed intervals, hence a closed axis-aligned rectangle — is contained in U),
  3) S ⊆ ⋃ (j : Fin k), Set.pi univ (λ i, Icc (a j i) (b j i)) (these rectangles cover S),
  4) ∀ j l, j ≠ l → interior(rect_j) ∩ interior(rect_l) = ∅ (the interiors of distinct rectangles are disjoint). Here rect_j denotes the product rectangle Set.pi univ (λ i, Icc (a j i) (b j i)).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: given U ⊆ ℝ^n open and S ⊆ U a compact Jordan measurable set, there exist finitely many closed rectangles P_1, ..., P_k contained in U, covering S, with pairwise disjoint interiors.
- The Lean statement matches the structure precisely:
  - Finite family of closed axis-aligned rectangles (products of closed intervals Icc) in ℝ^n.
  - Each lies in U.
  - Their union covers S.
  - Interiors are pairwise disjoint.
- Indexing by Fin k is a standard formalization of “k rectangles”. Using Set.pi over univ with Icc endpoints exactly captures closed rectangles aligned with axes.
- The disjointness condition is stated as interior(P_j) ∩ interior(P_l) = ∅ for j ≠ l, matching the natural language.

Differences:
- The natural language assumes S is “compact Jordan measurable”. The Lean code assumes only IsCompact S (and S ⊆ U), omitting Jordan measurability entirely. This is a generalization (stronger claim) rather than a weakening. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions; the theorem statement is substantive and uses standard Mathlib notions.
- The code allows n = 0 (Fin 0 → ℝ), which is a harmless generalization of ℝ^n.

Final check:
- Aside from omitting the “Jordan measurable” hypothesis, the Lean statement faithfully formalizes the rest of the claim (finite family of closed rectangles in U covering S with pairwise disjoint interiors). Given the guidelines, this is a slight generalization and a reasonable formalization route.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful, with the only notable difference being the omission of Jordan measurability, which makes the statement stronger. Assigning a high grade to reflect the near-perfect match.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- Variables: a, b are real numbers.
- Theorem uniform_on_interval_integral_mul states: Given functions f : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ, a limit function f_lim : ℝ → ℝ, and g : ℝ → ℝ, assuming (i) a ≤ b, (ii) g is continuous on the closed interval Icc a b (i.e., [a,b]), and (iii) uniform convergence of f n to f_lim on [a,b] expressed as: for every ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ [a,b], |f n x − f_lim x| ≤ ε, then the sequence of integrals ∫_{x in a..b} (f n x) * g x converges to ∫_{x in a..b} f_lim x * g x. Here the integral is the interval integral in Mathlib (Lebesgue interval integral with orientation), and Tendsto ... atTop (nhds ...) encodes the limit as n → ∞.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- NL statement: Suppose f_n → f uniformly on [a,b] and g is continuous on [a,b]. Prove lim_{n→∞} ∫_a^b f_n g = ∫_a^b f g.
- The Lean theorem mirrors the hypotheses of uniform convergence on [a,b] and continuity of g on [a,b], and concludes the convergence of the integrals of the products f_n g to f g over [a,b]. The domain and direction a ≤ b is handled by the hypothesis hab.

Step 3: Check for discrepancies.
- Type of integral: The NL statement is standardly interpreted in the Riemann setting (implicitly ensuring integrability), while the Lean code uses the Lebesgue interval integral. This can be acceptable as a generalization if assumptions ensure integrability.
- Missing integrability/boundedness assumptions: The Lean statement does not assume any integrability of f_n g or f g, nor boundedness/continuity of f_n, nor that the integrals are Riemann integrals. In the Lebesgue setting, uniform convergence on [a,b] and continuity of g alone do not guarantee that f_n g and f g are integrable; uniform convergence does not force f or the f_n to be bounded. Thus, the Lean statement asserts a stronger claim than the usual theorem and may be false without additional hypotheses (e.g., that each f_n is Riemann integrable or that f is bounded, or directly that f_n g and f g are integrable). The natural language statement implicitly works in a context where integrals exist (typically Riemann, where integrability implies boundedness). The Lean theorem omits these necessary conditions.
- Aside from integrability issues, the rest of the translation (uniform convergence on [a,b], continuity of g, the limit conclusion) matches well.

Conclusion: While very close in spirit, the Lean statement is not fully faithful because it lacks assumptions ensuring the integrals are well-defined/integrable in the Lebesgue framework. Therefore it overgeneralizes the natural language theorem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Metric Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open the namespaces for metric and set notation.
- The theorem `exists_finite_epsilon_net {X : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace X] {K : Set X} (hK : IsCompact K) (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) : ∃ S : Finset X, K ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ (↑S : Set X), Metric.ball x ε` states:
  Given a type X with a pseudometric structure, a set K ⊆ X that is compact, and a positive real ε, there exists a finite set S of points in X (a Finset X) such that K is contained in the union of open ε-balls centered at the points of S. In other words, the ε-balls around finitely many points cover K.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For a metric space (X,d), if K ⊂ X is compact, then for every ε > 0 there exists a finite ε-net for K.
- The Lean statement expresses exactly that K is coverable by finitely many open ε-balls, which is the usual definition of a finite ε-net for K.
- The theorem is parameterized by ε and requires hε : 0 < ε, matching the “for every ε > 0”.

3) Differences and assessment:
- The Lean code uses `[PseudoMetricSpace X]` instead of `[MetricSpace X]`. This is a slight generalization (pseudometrics allow distinct points at distance 0). This does not invalidate the statement and is acceptable as a slight generalization.
- The Lean code produces a `Finset X` without requiring that the centers lie in K (i.e., S ⊆ X, not necessarily S ⊆ K). Many definitions of an ε-net for K require the net to be a subset of K, though some allow centers anywhere in X. The natural language says “ε-net for K” (not explicitly “in K”), so allowing centers in X is a common and reasonable reading. If one insists on centers in K, the statement could be strengthened, but the given statement still faithfully captures the main claim: a finite ε-cover of K by ε-balls exists.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions or placeholders; the statement is direct, with no cheating.

Overall, the code is a faithful formalization of the given statement, with only a slight generalization (pseudometric) and a common definitional nuance (centers not forced to be in K).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Imports Mathlib.
- The doc-comment restates the classical theorem about differentiating a power series on its domain of convergence, mentioning radius equality, but the formal statement does not include the radius-of-convergence claim.
- Theorem `power_series_differentiable_on`:
  • Parameters: coefficients `c : ℕ → ℝ`, center `a : ℝ`, radius `ρ : ℝ` with `hρ : 0 < ρ`.
  • A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` (global function, though the properties are only asserted on the open set `{x | |x - a| < ρ}`).
  • Hypothesis `hsum`: for all `x` with `|x - a| < ρ`, the series `∑ c n * (x - a)^n` has sum `f x` (i.e., `f` agrees with the power series on that open set).
  • Hypothesis `hsum'`: for all `x` with `|x - a| < ρ`, the derived series `∑ (n+1) * c (n+1) * (x - a)^n` is summable.
  • Conclusion: `f` is differentiable on `{x | |x - a| < ρ}` and for all `x` in this set, `deriv f x = tsum (fun n => (n + 1) * c (n + 1) * (x - a) ^ n)`.
  • Proof omitted (`sorry`).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Given a power series with radius of convergence `0 < ρ ≤ ∞`, let `I = {x | |x - a| < ρ}` and `f` its sum on `I`. Then `f` is differentiable on `I` and `f'(x) = ∑ (n+1)c_{n+1}(x-a)^n` with the derived series having the same radius of convergence `ρ`.
- What the Lean theorem captures:
  • It captures: “On the open set `{x | |x-a|<ρ}`, if `f` equals the series, then `f` is differentiable and its derivative equals the termwise derived series.” This matches the differentiability and termwise differentiation conclusion.
  • It does not formalize the radius-of-convergence statement at all. There is no notion of radius of convergence in the statement, neither assumed for the original series nor concluded for the derived series.
  • Instead, it assumes pointwise summability of the derived series (`hsum'`), which in the classical theorem should be a consequence of having radius `ρ`, not an extra hypothesis. So the Lean statement is strictly weaker and misses the “radius unchanged” conclusion.
  • It also only treats finite `ρ` (a real number > 0), excluding the case `ρ = ∞` mentioned in the natural statement. This is a minor specialization.
  • `f` is defined on ℝ rather than `I`, but restricted via hypotheses; this is a standard harmless formalization detail.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The critical missing part is the claim that the radius of convergence of the derived series equals `ρ`. The code adds an extra hypothesis (summability of the derived series on the open ball) rather than deducing it, and it does not encode or assert any radius statement. It also omits the `ρ = ∞` case. Thus, while the derivative formula on the open ball is present, the full content of the natural statement is not faithfully captured.

Overall: Not faithful due to missing radius-of-convergence equality and added hypothesis.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

  This states: Let X be a metric space and K ⊆ X a compact set. For any ε > 0, there exists a finite set s ⊆ X (a Finset X) such that K is contained in the union over x in s of the open ε-balls centered at x; i.e., K ⊆ ⋃_{x ∈ s} B(x, ε).

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: “Prove that K is the union of finitely many open balls of radius ε, for every ε > 0.”
- The Lean statement proves: For every ε > 0, there exists a finite family of ε-balls whose union covers K (i.e., K ⊆ union of finitely many ε-balls).
- This is the standard compactness/totally boundedness covering result. However, the phrase “is the union” suggests equality K = ⋃ B(x_i, ε), which would make K open (since the right-hand side is open), and is generally false unless K is open. The Lean statement uses subset (coverage), which is the correct and standard formulation.
- Centers are allowed anywhere in X in the Lean statement; the natural language does not specify centers must lie in K, so this matches (and even if one wanted centers in K, that standard refinement is possible, but not required by the statement).

3) Final comparison:
- Difference: The natural language says “is the union” (equality), whereas the Lean code says “is contained in the union” (coverage). This is a substantive difference in logic (equality vs inclusion). The Lean version matches the mathematically correct and commonly intended result, but strictly speaking it is weaker than the literal wording of the natural language statement.
- Everything else (metric space, compact K, for every ε > 0, finitely many open balls of radius ε) aligns.

Conclusion: The translation is almost perfect and matches the intended theorem, but strictly speaking it does not assert equality. Hence it is not fully faithful to the literal wording.

- Conclusion: DifferentiableAt ℝ f c ∧ deriv f c = L: f is differentiable at c and its derivative at c equals L.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: f : (a, b) → ℝ is continuous and differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}, and lim_{x→c} f′(x) = L exists. Then f is differentiable at c and f′(c) = L.
- The Lean assumptions h, hcont, and hdiff faithfully encode “c ∈ (a, b)”, “f is continuous on (a, b)”, and “f is differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}”.
- The limit assumption is encoded as hlim using Tendsto of deriv f along nhds c. Since (a, b) is an open neighborhood of c, nhdsWithin c (Ioo a b) = nhds c, so there is no issue about approaching along the domain: approaching in ℝ or within (a, b) is equivalent here. The subtle point is that the code uses nhds c (not the punctured filter) and the total derivative function deriv (which is defined at c, typically defaulting to 0 if not differentiable). Thus hlim is slightly stronger than the usual “punctured” limit: it implicitly forces deriv f c = L already. The conclusion also states deriv f c = L and differentiability at c. So the hypothesis is a mild strengthening compared to the natural-language assumption, not a weakening or a vacuous replacement.

3) Final comparison:
- Same core mathematical content: continuous on (a, b), differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}, limit of derivatives exists at c equals L, conclude differentiability at c with derivative L.
- Difference: the Lean statement assumes Tendsto along nhds c rather than the punctured filter, which is stronger because it requires the value at c of deriv f to match L. This is a slight strengthening but does not change the nature of the result and is a standard formalization convenience in Mathlib given that (a, b) is a neighborhood of c and deriv is total. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

Given these considerations, the translation is essentially faithful with a minor strengthening in the limit hypothesis.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem monotone_seq_eventually_const_of_limit_eq_term {x : ℕ → ℝ} ...` introduces a sequence x from natural numbers to real numbers.
- `(hmono : Monotone x)` assumes x is monotone nondecreasing (order-preserving) on ℕ.
- `(k : ℕ)` fixes an index k in ℕ.
- `(hlim : Tendsto x atTop (nhds (x k)))` assumes the sequence x converges (as n → ∞) to the value x k, i.e., lim x_n = x_k.
- Conclusion: `∀ n, n ≥ k → x n = x k` states that for every n ≥ k, the sequence is constant and equals x k.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: A convergent monotone sequence {x_n} with lim x_n = x_k for some k satisfies x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k.
- The Lean statement captures exactly this: convergence to x k is expressed by `Tendsto x atTop (nhds (x k))`; monotonicity is assumed; and the conclusion is eventual constancy from k onward.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- Domain: The Lean code works over ℝ. The natural language likely also intends real sequences, so this is consistent (a slight specialization if one intended a more general ordered topological space, but acceptable).
- Monotonicity: `Monotone` in Lean means nondecreasing. The phrase ""monotone sequence"" in natural language can mean either nondecreasing or nonincreasing. The result holds for both, but the code only covers the nondecreasing case. This is a mild specialization, typically acceptable per the guidelines.
- Indexing: Lean uses ℕ starting at 0; the natural language uses n ≥ 1. The conclusion concerns n ≥ k, so the difference in starting index is irrelevant.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement is direct and faithful.

Overall, the Lean statement is an accurate and faithful formalization, with only a slight specialization to nondecreasing sequences over ℝ.

  This states: Let S be a subset of ℝ, c and L real numbers, f a function ℝ → ℝ, and a a real constant. If f tends to L along the filter nhdsWithin c S (i.e., as x → c with x restricted to S), then the function x ↦ a * f x tends to a * L along the same filter.

- Differences:
  - The code ignores g and its limit M; they are irrelevant to the stated conclusion, so this omission is harmless.
  - The code uses f : ℝ → ℝ with restriction to S via nhdsWithin, whereas the natural language had f : S → ℝ. This is a standard and slightly more general formalization; the limit along nhdsWithin depends only on values on S near c, so this captures the same notion.
  - The natural language mentions c is a cluster point of S. The Lean statement does not require this explicitly; instead it assumes the actual Tendsto hypothesis, which is stronger than (and implies the meaningfulness of) the limit statement. The cluster point condition is not needed to state or use the Tendsto hypothesis, so its omission does not change the content of the implication.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib (Filter, Tendsto, nhdsWithin, nhds).

- The code states exactly this, in the more general setting of real normed spaces E, F (a standard acceptable generalization). It asserts uniformity on compact K ⊆ U, and the bound ≤ ε‖h‖ for small h, which is the standard ε-δ formulation of little-o.
- The explicit requirement x + h ∈ U is natural/implicit in the usual phrasing, since only within U do the differentiability and continuity hypotheses hold; for compact K ⊆ U this can be ensured by choosing δ small, but the formal statement makes it explicit. This does not change the mathematical content.

3) Final comparison:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all are standard Mathlib notions (DifferentiableOn, ContinuousOn, fderiv, Convex, IsCompact).
- The conclusion matches the uniform little-o claim.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a legitimate and faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- Context: 𝕜 is a nontrivially normed field; X and Y are normed additive commutative groups with a normed space structure over 𝕜. This matches the setting of bounded linear operators between normed vector spaces (and even slightly generalizes from ℝ to any 𝕜).

- add_bounded (A B : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ∀ x, ‖(A + B) x‖ ≤ (‖A‖ + ‖B‖) * ‖x‖.
  Translation: If A and B are bounded (i.e., continuous) linear maps from X to Y, then for every x ∈ X, the norm of (A + B) applied to x is bounded by (‖A‖ + ‖B‖) times ‖x‖. This explicitly shows A + B is bounded and provides a bound in terms of the operator norms of A and B.

- smul_bounded (a : 𝕜) (A : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ∀ x, ‖(a • A) x‖ ≤ (‖a‖ * ‖A‖) * ‖x‖.
  Translation: For any scalar a ∈ 𝕜 and any bounded linear map A, the map a • A is bounded, with pointwise bound ‖(a•A)x‖ ≤ ‖a‖‖A‖‖x‖. This generalizes the statement from ℝ to any 𝕜.

- op_norm_nonneg (f : X →L[𝕜] Y) : 0 ≤ ‖f‖.
  Translation: The operator norm of any bounded linear map is nonnegative.

- op_norm_eq_zero_iff (f : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ‖f‖ = 0 ↔ f = 0.
  Translation: The operator norm is zero if and only if the operator is the zero map (definiteness).

- op_norm_triangle (f g : X →L[𝕜] Y) : ‖f + g‖ ≤ ‖f‖ + ‖g‖.
  Translation: The operator norm satisfies the triangle inequality.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- First part (sum bounded): The code states a standard sufficient inequality implying A + B is bounded. This matches the natural language and is faithful.
- Second part (scalar multiple bounded): The code asserts a standard inequality implying a•A is bounded, and does so for general 𝕜, which is a harmless generalization of α ∈ ℝ. Faithful.
- Third part (‖·‖_{L(X,Y)} is a norm): The code provides three key properties: nonnegativity, definiteness, and triangle inequality. However, a norm also requires homogeneity: ‖a f‖ = ‖a‖ ‖f‖ for all scalars a. The code does not state or prove the homogeneity property for the operator norm; it only gives the pointwise boundedness of a•A, not the norm homogeneity. Thus, the translation of “is a norm” is incomplete.

Step 3: Final check — are the two problems the same?
- They coincide on the first two claims (boundedness under addition and scalar multiplication), with a benign generalization of scalars.
- For the final claim, the Lean code presents only part of the norm axioms and omits homogeneity of the operator norm. Therefore, it does not fully translate “‖·‖_{L(X,Y)} is a norm on L(X,Y).”

Conclusion: The code is almost faithful but misses a key axiom for the norm, so it is not fully faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem outer_measure_zero_of_approx_small {α : Type _} (m : Set α → ENNReal)`: We fix a type α and a function m assigning to each subset of α a value in the extended nonnegative reals (an ""outer-measure-like"" function).
- `(mono : ∀ A B : Set α, A ⊆ B → m A ≤ m B)`: m is assumed monotone with respect to set inclusion.
- `(X : Set α)`: Fix a set X ⊆ α.
- `(h : ∀ ε : ENNReal, 0 < ε → ∃ Y, X ⊆ Y ∧ m Y ≤ ε)`: For every ε > 0 (in ENNReal), there exists a set Y with X ⊆ Y and m(Y) ≤ ε.
- `: m X = 0`: Conclusion: m(X) = 0.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- Original: α is ℝ^n, m is the outer measure m*, and the hypothesis is: for every ε > 0, there exists Y ⊇ X with m*(Y) ≤ ε. Conclusion: m*(X) = 0.
- Lean: Generalizes the setting from ℝ^n to an arbitrary type α and from the specific outer measure m* to an arbitrary set function m taking values in ENNReal, but assumes monotonicity and the same approximation hypothesis. The conclusion is identical in form: m(X) = 0. This is a standard and faithful generalization: the proof uses only monotonicity and the approximation property, which outer measures satisfy.
- Technical details: Using ENNReal for ε matches the codomain of an outer measure. Requiring monotonicity explicitly is appropriate (outer measures are monotone). No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no placeholders. The theorem statement cleanly captures the intended claim.

Final check: The math problems are the same up to a harmless generalization (from ℝ^n and a specific outer measure to any monotone ENNReal-valued set function on any type).

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The ambient space is (Fin n → ℝ), which is a standard Lean representation of ℝ^n. The function is f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ.
- Assumptions:
  - hU : Convex ℝ U means U ⊆ ℝ^n is convex.
  - hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U means f is C^2 on U (in the sense of Fréchet derivatives up to order 2 existing and being continuous on U).
- Statement:
  - For every compact set K ⊆ ℝ^n, with IsCompact K and K ⊆ U, and for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K, and for all h ∈ ℝ^n with x + h ∈ U and ‖h‖ < δ, one has
    | f(x + h) − f x − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * (((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h) | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  - Here fderiv ℝ f x is the Fréchet derivative (the gradient as a linear map) at x, and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the second derivative (a continuous bilinear map once applied twice), playing the role of the Hessian. The second-order Taylor polynomial at x is thus f x + (f')_x h + (1/2) (f'')_x(h,h).
- The quantifier order (∃ δ > 0 independent of x ∈ K) gives a uniform estimate on K. The side condition x + h ∈ U ensures the evaluation point remains in the region where the C^2 hypothesis holds.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 and H_f continuous in a convex set U. Show the remainder in the second-order Taylor approximation is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean hypothesis hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U captures exactly “f is C^2 on U” with continuous second derivative there (so the Hessian is continuous on U). This matches or slightly strengthens the NL assumption restricted to U; the NL phrasing suggests f is globally C^2, but the claim concerns behavior on U, and ContDiffOn on U is sufficient.
- The conclusion is given in an ε–δ form: for any ε > 0 there is δ > 0 (uniform over x ∈ K) such that the remainder is bounded by ε‖h‖^2 whenever ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U. This is the standard formulation of the little-o remainder uniformly on compact K ⊆ U.
- The explicit second-order term uses fderiv-of-fderiv in a way that matches the Hessian applied to (h,h), scaled by 1/2, which is the classical second-order Taylor polynomial.
- The extra condition x + h ∈ U is appropriate and implicit in the NL statement since the expansion must be evaluated where the hypotheses on f hold; for non-open U this is the natural way to state it. The uniformity (δ independent of x ∈ K) is explicit in the Lean statement.

Final check:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement ending with `by sorry` (allowed by the task). All Mathlib notions used (Convex, ContDiffOn, fderiv) are standard.
- The formal statement is a faithful translation of the NL claim, possibly even slightly more general (only requires C^2 on U rather than globally). The use of fderiv (rather than within-derivatives) is consistent with f : ℝ^n → ℝ being a global function and the hypotheses concerning behavior on U.
- Therefore, the mathematical content matches: the remainder is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The code works over a general nontrivially normed field 𝕜: `variable {𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜]`.
- X and Y are normed vector spaces over 𝕜 that are also complete (Banach spaces): `[NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedAddCommGroup Y] [NormedSpace 𝕜 X] [NormedSpace 𝕜 Y] [CompleteSpace X] [CompleteSpace Y]`.
- A is a continuous (bounded) linear map: `A : X →L[𝕜] Y`.
- The hypothesis `hbij : Function.Bijective (A : X → Y)` says A is one-to-one and onto as a function.
- The theorem statement asserts the existence of a continuous linear map `B : Y →L[𝕜] X` such that `B` is both a left and right inverse of `A` as functions: `Function.LeftInverse (B : Y → X) (A : X → Y)` (i.e. B ∘ A = id) and `Function.RightInverse (B : Y → X) (A : X → Y)` (i.e. A ∘ B = id). This exactly says that the inverse function A⁻¹ is itself continuous/bounded, realized by B as a continuous linear map.

Assessment vs. the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Given normed vector spaces X, Y and A ∈ L(X, Y) that is bijective, show A⁻¹ is bounded. Option to use the open mapping theorem; otherwise, give a proof assuming completeness.
- The Lean code assumes completeness of X and Y (Banach spaces) and states precisely that the inverse is a continuous linear map. This matches the mathematical content: A bijective continuous linear map between Banach spaces has a continuous linear inverse (bounded inverse). The existence of B as a continuous linear inverse is exactly the formalization of “A⁻¹ is bounded.”
- The code slightly generalizes the base field to any nontrivially normed field, which is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- No auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib ones. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per instructions we evaluate the statement, not the proof.

Final check:
- Are the two problems the same? Yes. The Lean theorem precisely formalizes the claim that a bijective bounded linear operator between Banach spaces has a bounded inverse, stated as the existence of a continuous linear inverse. The completeness assumption aligns with the suggested approach via the open mapping theorem. No discrepancies were found.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We work in finite-dimensional real spaces: (Fin n → ℝ) is ℝ^n with its standard normed space structure.
- U : Set (Fin n → ℝ) is the convex set where the hypotheses hold; f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ is the function.
- p : (Fin n → ℝ) → FormalMultilinearSeries ℝ (Fin n → ℝ) ℝ assigns to each x a sequence of k-multilinear maps (the coefficients of the formal Taylor series of f at x).
- hU_convex : Convex ℝ U assumes U is convex.
- hFT : HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 f p U states that, on U, f admits derivatives up to order 2, captured by p x 0, p x 1, p x 2.
- hcont : ContinuousOn (fun x => p x 2) U states continuity on U of the second derivative coefficient (the Hessian, viewed as a bilinear form).
- The conclusion: For every compact K ⊆ U, for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ ≤ δ and x + h ∈ U, we have
  | f(x + h) − f(x) − (p x 1) (fun _ => h) − (1/2) * (p x 2) (fun _ => h) | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here (p x 1) is the derivative at x (a linear map) applied to h (encoded as a 1-tuple via fun _ => h), and (p x 2) is the second derivative (a bilinear form) applied to (h, h) (encoded as a 2-tuple via fun _ => h), matching the quadratic term with the factor 1/2.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: f : ℝ^n → ℝ, f is differentiable, and its Hessian H_f is continuous on a convex set U. Then the second-order Taylor expansion with remainder o(‖h‖^2) holds as h → 0 uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean statement encodes the first and second derivatives via HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 and identifies the Hessian as p x 2, adding an explicit continuity assumption hcont. This matches “H_f is continuous on U.” The linear term (p x 1)(...) corresponds to ∇f(x)·h via the identification of the Frechet derivative with a linear map; in ℝ^n these are equivalent to the gradient dot product. The quadratic term (1/2)*(p x 2)(...) corresponds to (1/2) hᵀ H_f(x) h. The uniform o(‖h‖^2) on compact subsets is expressed by the ε-δ uniform estimate over K compact ⊆ U. The condition x + h ∈ U enforces staying in U (needed when U is not assumed open), which is a standard and reasonable technical condition for uniformity over compacts in a set where the Hessian continuity is assumed; it is consistent with the intended meaning of “uniformly on compact subsets of U.”

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Domain/codomain and convexity: match.
- Regularity assumptions: the Lean code uses HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn 2 plus continuity of the second coefficient, which aligns with the natural “differentiable with continuous Hessian on U.”
- Form of the expansion and uniform little-o: expressed as a uniform ε-δ inequality on compacts, exactly the right notion.
- Minor formalization details: uses general Frechet derivative and bilinear forms instead of explicitly “∇f” and “H_f”, but these are equivalent in ℝ^n. Norm on ℝ^n is the sup norm induced by the pi structure, but all norms are equivalent in finite dimension, so the little-o statement is unaffected. The requirement x + h ∈ U is a natural technical condition consistent with the intended statement when U is not open.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only standard and acceptable formalization choices.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_smaller_value_of_polynomial_in_ball (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) (p : Polynomial ℂ) (hp : Polynomial.degree p ≠ 0) (z0 : ℂ) (hp0 : Polynomial.eval z0 p ≠ 0) : ...`
  This states: For a real ε > 0, a complex polynomial p, with the hypothesis that `degree p ≠ 0` (i.e., p is not a constant nonzero polynomial), a complex point z0, and the hypothesis that p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists a complex number w such that:
- `∃ w : ℂ, w ∈ Metric.ball z0 ε ∧ (Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval w p) < Complex.abs (Polynomial.eval z0 p))`
  i.e., there exists w in the open ball { z : |z - z0| < ε } such that |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.

Notes on assumptions:
- `hp : Polynomial.degree p ≠ 0` excludes nonzero constants. It does not exclude the zero polynomial (whose degree is ⊥), but the separate hypothesis `hp0 : eval z0 p ≠ 0` rules out the zero polynomial. Together, these hypotheses ensure p is indeed nonconstant and p(z0) ≠ 0, matching the intended polynomial case.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For ε > 0, and p a nonconstant complex polynomial (or more generally a nonconstant power series convergent on the ball), with p(z0) ≠ 0, there exists w in the ball such that |p(w)| < |p(z0)|.
- The Lean theorem captures exactly this conclusion for the special case where p is a polynomial, with correct domain (open ball), correct inequality, and the condition p(z0) ≠ 0.
- Nonconstancy is effectively enforced via `degree p ≠ 0` together with `eval z0 p ≠ 0` (excluding the zero polynomial), which is acceptable in this context.

3) Differences:
- Scope: The Lean statement handles only polynomials (`Polynomial ℂ`), not the more general case of power series converging on the ball. This is a specialization of the natural language statement. Per the guidelines, a slight specialization is acceptable.
- Technical encoding of nonconstancy: The code uses `degree p ≠ 0` plus `eval z0 p ≠ 0`. While `degree p ≠ 0` alone does not exclude the zero polynomial, `eval z0 p ≠ 0` does, so together they faithfully represent a nonconstant polynomial with p(z0) ≠ 0.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the polynomial case, which is a slight specialization of the original statement including power series. No vacuous definitions or placeholders are used. Hence it passes, with a minor scope restriction.

- `variable {𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] {F : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup F] [NormedSpace 𝕜 F]` sets up a general normed scalar field 𝕜 and normed vector spaces E and F over 𝕜.
- The theorem `invertible_under_small_perturbation (L : E ≃L[𝕜] F)` assumes L is a continuous linear equivalence from E to F (i.e., a bounded linear map with a bounded inverse). The statement is: there exists δ > 0 such that for any bounded linear map A : E →L[𝕜] F, if ‖A - L.toContinuousLinearMap‖ < δ, then there exists a bounded linear map Ainv : F →L[𝕜] E satisfying Ainv ∘ A = id on E and A ∘ Ainv = id on F (i.e., A is invertible with bounded inverse), and moreover the operator norm of Ainv satisfies the bound

This exactly encodes the Neumann-series-type estimate for the inverse of a small perturbation of an invertible operator.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- The Lean code assumes L is a continuous linear equivalence (i.e., L and L^{-1} are bounded), which matches the intended “invertible and L^{-1} bounded” context and also ensures ‖A - L‖ is meaningful.
- A is taken to be a continuous linear map (bounded operator), consistent with the context where operator norms are used.
- Invertibility of A is expressed via existence of a two-sided inverse Ainv with Ainv.comp A = id and A.comp Ainv = id. This is equivalent to A being invertible, and also gives the boundedness of the inverse explicitly.
- The norm bound stated matches the formula in the natural language statement, with L.symm representing L^{-1}.
- Scalars are generalized to any nontrivially normed field 𝕜, which is a standard and acceptable generalization of the usual ℝ or ℂ setting.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The Lean statement is essentially the same theorem as the natural language statement, formalized in terms of continuous linear maps and equivalences. It includes all the same hypotheses and conclusions: existence of δ, the small-norm perturbation condition, invertibility of A, and the Neumann-series norm bound. The expression of invertibility via explicit inverse and identities is faithful.
- Slight generalization: the base field 𝕜 is arbitrary nontrivially normed, not just ℝ or ℂ. This is acceptable.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts used are standard Mathlib objects.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We work over a commutative ring R.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index set for rows and columns is an arbitrary finite type n with decidable equality. So matrices are n×n with entries in R (slight generalization of using Fin n, but equivalent in meaning).

- `def swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix n n R := fun i l => if l = j then A i k else if l = k then A i j else A i l`: This defines the matrix obtained from A by swapping columns j and k: for each row i and column l, if l = j we take the entry from column k, if l = k we take from column j, otherwise we keep the original entry. This is the standard column swap.

- `def swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : Matrix n n R := fun i l => if i = j then A k l else if i = k then A j l else A i l`: Similarly, this defines the matrix obtained from A by swapping rows j and k.

- `theorem det_swap_cols ... (h : j ≠ k) : Matrix.det (swap_cols A j k) = - Matrix.det A := by sorry`: States that if j and k are distinct, then swapping columns j and k negates the determinant: det(swap_cols A j k) = - det A. Proof omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The first two theorems exactly formalize: swapping two distinct columns (or rows) negates the determinant. The requirement j ≠ k is natural and implicit in the phrasing “switching column j and k.”
- The last two theorems exactly formalize: if two rows (or columns) are equal, then the determinant is zero.
- The ring is a general commutative ring R, which is a standard and acceptable generality for determinants. The index type n is any finite type; this is a standard formalization choice equivalent to an n×n matrix.
- No reliance on Laplace expansion is encoded or required in the statement; the code only states the properties, which matches the instruction to avoid proof details.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: swap_rows and swap_cols are concrete, not trivialized.
- The theorems are stated exactly as in the natural language, with the minimal and appropriate distinctness hypotheses for indices.
- Slight generalization (arbitrary finite index type instead of Fin n) is acceptable and standard.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but nothing from Mathlib is actually used to define the notions in the statement.
- variable {a b : ℝ} (f : ℝ → ℝ): Fix real endpoints a, b and a function f: ℝ → ℝ. The natural language statement considers f on [a,b], but here f is defined on all ℝ (which is fine, since later hypotheses are about [a,b]).
- variable (IsPartition : Finset ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → Prop): Introduces an abstract predicate saying a finite set of ℝ is a partition of [a,b]. This is not Mathlib’s concept; it is an arbitrary, unconstrained predicate.
- variable (upper_sum lower_sum : Finset ℝ → (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ): Introduces abstract functions for upper and lower sums for a partition and an integrand. Again, arbitrary and unconstrained; not linked to Mathlib’s Darboux sums or Riemann sums.
- variable (BoundedOnInterval : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop): Abstract boundedness predicate on [a,b].
- variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → Prop): Abstract integrability predicate on [a,b].
- variable (RiemannIntegral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ): Abstract function giving the value of the integral on [a,b]; not used later.
- theorem riemann_integrable_of_partitions ...: States: given a sequence of finite sets P : ℕ → Finset ℝ which satisfy IsPartition (P k) a b for all k, and a boundedness hypothesis BoundedOnInterval f a b, and a vanishing-gap hypothesis |upper_sum (P k) f - lower_sum (P k) f| → 0, then there exists I : ℝ such that (i) RiemannIntegrableOn f a b holds and (ii) both sequences upper_sum (P k) f and lower_sum (P k) f converge to I. The proof is omitted (sorry).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- Natural statement: If there is a sequence of partitions P_k of [a,b] with U(P_k,f) - L(P_k,f) → 0 for a bounded function f, then f is Riemann integrable and ∫_a^b f = lim U(P_k,f) = lim L(P_k,f).
- Code statement issues:
  - All central notions (partition, upper/lower sums, boundedness, integrability, integral) are declared as arbitrary variables/predicates/functions with no axioms tying them to their intended meanings. This makes the theorem schematic and not specifically about Riemann integration.
  - The theorem does not assert that the common limit I equals the Riemann integral RiemannIntegral f a b. In fact, RiemannIntegral is never used. The original statement requires equality with the integral value.
  - The hypothesis uses absolute value |U(P_k,f) - L(P_k,f)| → 0. In classical Riemann theory, U ≥ L so absolute value is equivalent to U - L → 0. However, because upper_sum and lower_sum are abstract and not constrained by any monotonicity, this is neither guaranteed nor clearly matching the intended meaning.
  - The representation of partitions as Finset ℝ with an abstract IsPartition is acceptable in principle, but here it is unconstrained; there is no guarantee it actually encodes true partitions of [a,b].
  - Domain [a,b] is not enforced (f is ℝ → ℝ, which is fine if boundedness on [a,b] is assumed), but this is minor compared to the above issues.

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is strictly weaker and more abstract: it only claims existence of a limit I of both upper_sum and lower_sum sequences and that f is “RiemannIntegrableOn”, but never ties I to the value of the integral, nor ties any of the abstract predicates to standard Riemann theory. Moreover, the concepts are entirely unconstrained placeholders.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful. It also introduces a vacuous unused symbol RiemannIntegral and omits the key conclusion ∫_a^b f = lim U = lim L.

Conclusion: Fails the fidelity check due to vacuous/abstract placeholders and missing the essential equality with the integral.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` sets up the dimension n of the Euclidean space.
- The theorem states: For a set `U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)` (i.e., U ⊆ ℝ^n) and a function `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` and a real constant `M : ℝ`, assume:
  - `hU : Convex ℝ U` (U is convex),
  - `hcd : ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U` (f is C¹ on U, i.e., has continuous derivative/partial derivatives on U),
  - `hM : ∀ x, x ∈ U → ‖(fderivWithin ℝ f U x)‖ ≤ M` (the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative of f within U at x is bounded by M for all x ∈ U).
  Then the conclusion is: for all `x y ∈ U`, `|f y - f x - (fderivWithin ℝ f U x) (y - x)| ≤ M * ‖y - x‖`.
- Here `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the Lean encoding of ℝ^n. The Fréchet derivative at x, `fderivWithin ℝ f U x : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] ℝ`, is a continuous linear functional, which corresponds to the gradient via the Euclidean inner product. Applying it to `(y - x)` corresponds to the dot product `∇f(x) · (y - x)`. The norm `‖(fderivWithin ...)‖` is the operator norm, equal to the Euclidean norm of the gradient in this finite-dimensional setting.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Domain and codomain match: f : ℝ^n → ℝ.
- Regularity: “continuous partial derivatives on a convex set U” matches `ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U`.
- Bounded gradient: “‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M for all x ∈ U” matches `‖fderivWithin ℝ f U x‖ ≤ M` (operator norm equals gradient norm in ℝ^n → ℝ).
- Conclusion: `|f(y) - f(x) - ∇f(x)·(y-x)| ≤ M ‖y-x‖` matches the Lean inequality using `fderivWithin` applied to `(y-x)` and absolute value on ℝ.
- Quantification over x, y ∈ U is explicit in the Lean code, consistent with the intended statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Using `fderivWithin` (derivative within U) instead of `fderiv`/explicit gradient is a standard formalization when working on a possibly non-open convex set and is faithful to the intent of “on a convex set U”.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all concepts are from Mathlib.
- No extraneous assumptions are added beyond convexity, C¹ regularity on U, and the norm bound. The statement matches the intended inequality.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `theorem dirichlet_bv_of_bounded_partial_sums {x : ℕ → ℝ} {a : ℕ → ℝ}`: Let x and a be real sequences indexed by natural numbers (starting at 0).
- Hypothesis `h_bdd : ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ N, |(Finset.sum (Finset.range (N+1)) (fun i => x i))| ≤ C`:
  There exists a constant C such that for every N, the partial sum S_N = ∑_{i=0}^N x_i satisfies |S_N| ≤ C. So the sequence of partial sums of the series ∑ x_n is bounded.
- Hypothesis `h_lim : Filter.Tendsto (fun n => a n) Filter.atTop (nhds (0 : ℝ))`:
  The sequence a_n tends to 0 as n → ∞.
- Hypothesis `h_var : Summable fun n => |a (n+1) - a n|`:
  The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ |a_{n+1} − a_n| converges (finite total variation of a_n).
- Conclusion `Summable fun n => a n * x n`:
  The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n x_n converges.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original statement: Let ∑_{n=1}^∞ x_n have bounded partial sums; let (λ_n) satisfy λ_n → 0 and ∑_{n=1}^∞ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges. Then ∑_{n=1}^∞ λ_n x_n converges.
- The Lean code is the same statement, with minor indexing shifts:
  • Partial sums in Lean start from 0: ∑_{i=0}^N x_i vs from 1. Boundedness is unaffected by adding/subtracting the constant x_0, so this is equivalent.
  • The variation sum in Lean starts at n=0: ∑_{n=0}^∞ |a_{n+1} − a_n| vs from 1. Adding/removing a single initial term does not affect convergence, so this is equivalent.
- The field is ℝ in the code; the natural language did not specify the field, but ℝ is a standard and acceptable specialization.
- The conclusion is exactly the desired convergence of ∑ a_n x_n.

Step 3: Final check of differences.
- Indexing starts at 0 in the code versus 1 in the statement: harmless and equivalent for the properties involved.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given.
- All assumptions match: bounded partial sums of x_n, a_n → 0, finite total variation of a_n, concluding convergence of ∑ a_n x_n.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (Dirichlet test with bounded variation). Any indexing differences are inconsequential.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib.
- `variable {n : ℕ} (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: We work in ℝ^n represented as `Fin n → ℝ`. `R` is an arbitrary subset of ℝ^n, and `f` is a real-valued function on ℝ^n.
- `variable (Riemann_integrable_on : (((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop))`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate symbol for “Riemann integrable on a set,” not tied to Mathlib’s actual definition.
- `variable (integral_on : (((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ))`: Introduces an arbitrary function symbol for an integral over a set, not tied to Mathlib’s integral notions.
- `variable (outer_measure_zero : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate for “outer measure zero,” again not tied to Mathlib’s notion.
- The theorem statement:
  Hypotheses:
  • `h_int : Riemann_integrable_on f R`: f is integrable on R per the arbitrary predicate.
  • `hf_nonneg : ∀ x ∈ R, 0 ≤ f x`: f ≥ 0 on R.
  • `h_integral_zero : integral_on f R = 0`: the integral over R is zero per the arbitrary integral.
  Conclusion:
  • `∃ E, outer_measure_zero E ∧ ∀ x ∈ R \ E, f x = 0`: There exists a set E with the arbitrary “outer measure zero” such that f vanishes on R minus E. No requirement that E ⊆ R.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- Original: R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n. Code: R is an arbitrary set; no restriction to closed rectangles. Missing crucial hypothesis.
- Original: f is Riemann integrable on R in the classical sense. Code: introduces a totally arbitrary predicate `Riemann_integrable_on`, not tied to Mathlib’s Riemann integral or any standard notion.
- Original: integral of f over R equals 0 (standard Riemann integral). Code: uses an arbitrary `integral_on` function; not linked to Riemann integral.
- Original: There exists E ⊆ R of outer measure zero (Lebesgue outer measure) such that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R \ E. Code: introduces an arbitrary predicate `outer_measure_zero` with no connection to Lebesgue outer measure; furthermore, does not require E ⊆ R.
- Additionally, since `outer_measure_zero` is arbitrary, we cannot even infer that taking `E ∩ R` preserves “outer measure zero,” so the missing subset condition is not harmless here.

Step 3: Final check
- The formal statement is not a faithful translation. It replaces key mathematical notions (Riemann integrability, integral, outer measure zero) with uninterpreted placeholders and omits the essential hypothesis that R is a closed rectangle. It also fails to state E ⊆ R. Therefore the two statements are not the same.

Other red flags
- The proof is `by sorry` (allowed), but more importantly, all core notions are placeholders/uninterpreted, violating the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

- Using an arbitrary finite index type n is a standard formalization of “n × n” matrices; it is equivalent to the usual notion of square matrices.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same mathematical content: multiplicativity of determinant for square matrices.
- Slight formalization detail: explicitly assumes a commutative ring R and finite index type, which is the standard requirement for det in Mathlib. The natural statement did not specify the coefficient ring, but implicitly it’s in a commutative setting. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Two placeholder definitions are introduced:
  - RiemannIntegrableOn (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop := True. This declares every function integrable on every interval, which is vacuous and not a faithful definition.
  - RiemannIntegral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0. This assigns the constant 0 as the integral for all functions and intervals, also vacuous.
- The theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_riemann_1152 has parameters:
  - f : ℝ → ℝ, real numbers a, b with ha : a < b.
  - Sequences a_n, b_n : ℕ → ℝ.
  - h_seq: ∀ n, a < a_n n ∧ a_n n < b_n n ∧ b_n n < b (i.e., a < a_n < b_n < b for all n).
  - h_lim_a: Tendsto a_n atTop (nhds a) and h_lim_b: Tendsto b_n atTop (nhds b) (i.e., a_n → a and b_n → b).
  - h_bdd: ∃ M, ∀ x, a ≤ x → x ≤ b → |f x| ≤ M (i.e., f is bounded on [a,b]).
  - h_int: ∀ n, RiemannIntegrableOn f (a_n n) (b_n n) (i.e., integrable on each [a_n, b_n], but using the placeholder notion).
- The conclusion is a conjunction:
  - RiemannIntegrableOn f a b (i.e., integrable on [a,b], again via the placeholder), and
  - Tendsto (fun n => RiemannIntegral f (a_n n) (b_n n)) atTop (nhds (RiemannIntegral f a b)) (i.e., the integrals over [a_n, b_n] converge to the integral over [a, b], expressed with Tendsto instead of a limit equality; mathematically equivalent for sequences in ℝ).
- The proof is omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for translation checking, but not ideal. The main issue is the placeholder definitions.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The hypotheses and the shape of the conclusion match the natural language statement: boundedness on [a,b], nested intervals approaching [a,b], integrability on [a_n, b_n], conclude integrability on [a,b] and convergence of integrals.
- However, the code uses vacuous placeholders for the core notions (Riemann integrability and the Riemann integral), making the statement trivial and not a faithful encoding of the mathematics.
- The use of Tendsto to express the limit is fine. The function being defined on ℝ rather than [a,b] is standard in Lean; boundedness is restricted to [a,b], which aligns with the natural statement.

Final check:
- Are the two problems the same? Conceptually, the intended theorem statement is captured, but due to the vacuous placeholder definitions, the Lean code does not legitimately formalize Riemann integrability or the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.
- No other auxiliary definitions are present besides the vacuous placeholders. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate.

Grade rationale:
- Since the main mathematical content is replaced with placeholders (Prop := True and constant 0), the translation fails. If those placeholders were replaced with proper Mathlib notions (e.g., a real Riemann integrability predicate and integral), the theorem statement would be faithful to the original. This fits the rubric for a 6: vacuous definitions, but with those fixed, the final theorem would be faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open the namespace for set-theoretic notation.
- `variable {X : Type*} {Rect : Type*} (rect_set : Rect → Set X) (V : Rect → ENNReal)`: We work abstractly over a type X (playing the role of the ambient space, e.g., R^n) and a type Rect (playing the role of rectangles). The function `rect_set` interprets a rectangle as a subset of X, and `V` assigns a nonnegative extended real “volume” to each rectangle.

- `noncomputable def m_star (S : Set X) : ENNReal := sInf ({ t : ENNReal | ∃ f : ℕ → Rect, t = ∑' j, V (f j) ∧ S ⊆ ⋃ j, rect_set (f j) } : Set ENNReal)`: Define m_star(S) as the infimum of all sums of the form `∑' j, V (f j)` where `f : ℕ → Rect` is a sequence of rectangles whose union covers S. This matches taking the infimum over countable (sequence-indexed by ℕ) covers.

- `noncomputable def mu_star (S : Set X) : ENNReal := sInf ({ t : ENNReal | ∃ (I : Type*) (hc : Countable I) (f : I → Rect), t = ∑' i, V (f i) ∧ S ⊆ ⋃ i, rect_set (f i) } : Set ENNReal)`: Define mu_star(S) as the infimum over all countable index types I (Countable includes finite) and functions `f : I → Rect` such that S is covered by the union of `rect_set (f i)`, with total sum `∑' i, V (f i)`. This exactly encodes “finite or countably infinite” index sets.

- `theorem mu_eq_m (S : Set X) : mu_star rect_set V S = m_star rect_set V S := by sorry`: States the desired equality for all S; proof omitted (allowed for translation check). No vacuous or fake definitions are used.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement fixes X = R^n, Rect = open rectangles, `rect_set` picks out the set underlying each rectangle, and V is the standard volume. The Lean code abstracts this, but the structure of both m_star and mu_star exactly matches the definitions given: m_star uses sequences (indexed by ℕ), mu_star uses finite or countable index sets (expressed as a countable type I, which in Lean includes finite types). The covering condition `S ⊆ ⋃ ...` and the sum of volumes `∑' ... V(...)` are represented correctly.
- The generalization to arbitrary X, Rect, rect_set, V is acceptable and faithful to the core statement since the equality depends only on the indexing/covering structure, not on the specific nature of rectangles in R^n.

3) Final comparison:
- Both problems assert that the infimum over countable sequences equals the infimum over finite-or-countable families. The Lean theorem states exactly `mu_star = m_star` for every S, matching the original claim. There are no auxiliary fake placeholders; all definitions are legitimate. The slight generalization is standard and faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",8,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- hf : MeasureTheory.Integrable (fun t => |f t|)
  This assumes the absolute value of f is Lebesgue integrable on ℝ (i.e., |f| ∈ L¹(ℝ)). Note: in Lean, Integrable requires measurability of the given function; here the measurable function is |f|.
- hg_cont : Continuous g
  g is continuous on ℝ.
- hg_supp : ∀ x, x < a ∨ x > b → g x = 0
  g vanishes outside the closed interval [a, b]. Equivalently, supp g ⊆ [a, b].
- Conclusion: ∀ x : ℝ, MeasureTheory.Integrable (fun t => f t * g (x - t))
  For every x, the function t ↦ f(t) g(x − t) is Lebesgue integrable on ℝ, so the convolution integral ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt is well-defined (finite).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Original: f is (improper) Riemann integrable with ∫ |f(x)| dx < ∞, g is continuous and zero outside [a,b]; show (g*f)(x) = ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt is well-defined for all x.
- Lean: Assumes |f| is Lebesgue integrable (hf), g is continuous and zero outside [a,b], and concludes the integrability of t ↦ f(t) g(x − t) for all x.
- Generally, replacing “Riemann integrable with ∫ |f| < ∞” by “|f| ∈ L¹(ℝ)” is a standard and acceptable generalization when formalizing in measure theory: it ensures absolute integrability, which suffices for the convolution integral with compactly supported g.

Step 3: Check for discrepancies.
- Important technical issue: The Lean assumption hf is Integrable (|f|) rather than Integrable f. In Mathlib, Integrable h requires that h is AEStronglyMeasurable and ∫ ‖h‖ < ∞. Assuming Integrable (|f|) only gives measurability of |f|, not necessarily of f. It is possible to have f nonmeasurable while |f| is measurable and integrable (e.g., f takes values ±1 on a nonmeasurable subset of a set of finite measure, so |f| is the measurable indicator). In that case, the product t ↦ f(t) g(x − t) may fail to be measurable and thus not be Integrable, making the Lean statement potentially false under its own hypotheses.
- By contrast, the natural language assumption “f is Riemann integrable” implicitly ensures measurability of f (indeed, improper Riemann integrability implies Lebesgue measurability). So the original statement’s hypotheses are stronger in the right way to guarantee measurability of the integrand.
- Other aspects (continuity of g, vanishing outside [a,b], conclusion of integrability for each x) match well.

Conclusion: While the overall structure matches and the measure-theoretic recasting is appropriate, the Lean hypothesis hf is too weak (it does not ensure measurability of f), so the formal statement is not fully faithful to the natural language statement. No vacuous placeholders were introduced; the mismatch is a meaningful technical one.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem integral_operator_well_defined_and_linear takes as input a kernel k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ together with hk : Continuous k (i.e., k is continuous on all of ℝ²).
- It asserts a conjunction of two statements:
  1) For every function f : ℝ → ℝ that is ContinuousOn the closed interval Icc 0 1 = [0,1], the function y ↦ ∫_{x∈[0,1]} k(x,y) * f(x) dx is ContinuousOn [0,1]. Here the integral is the Lebesgue integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure restricted to [0,1]. In other words, Lf is continuous on [0,1] whenever f is continuous on [0,1].
  2) For any f, g : ℝ → ℝ that are ContinuousOn [0,1], and any scalars a, b : ℝ, the function equality holds pointwise for all y ∈ ℝ:
     y ↦ ∫_{x∈[0,1]} k(x,y) * (a * f(x) + b * g(x)) dx = y ↦ a * ∫_{x∈[0,1]} k(x,y) * f(x) dx + b * ∫_{x∈[0,1]} k(x,y) * g(x) dx.
     This is exactly the statement L(af + bg) = a Lf + b Lg, expressed as equality of functions.
- The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for translation checking.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Original: k : [0,1]^2 → ℝ is continuous. Define Lf(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx. Show L maps C([0,1],ℝ) to C([0,1],ℝ) (well-definedness) and is linear.
- Lean: Assumes k is continuous on all ℝ×ℝ (stronger than continuity on [0,1]^2), and for any f continuous on [0,1], the y ↦ ∫_{[0,1]} k(x,y) f(x) dx is continuous on [0,1] (well-definedness), and linearity holds pointwise for all y.
- The Lean statement uses ContinuousOn on Icc 0 1 instead of the ContinuousMap type C([0,1],ℝ), but it captures the same content: inputs are functions continuous on [0,1], outputs are continuous on [0,1], and the operator is linear.
- The integral is Lebesgue over [0,1], consistent with the usual meaning of ∫_0^1.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence and differences.
- Faithful aspects: It defines L via the same formula, proves well-definedness (continuity of Lf on [0,1]) under the input f being continuous on [0,1], and proves linearity L(af+bg) = aLf + bLg.
- Differences:
  - The code assumes k is continuous on ℝ×ℝ (stronger) rather than only on [0,1]^2. This is a slight specialization/strengthening of hypotheses, acceptable per the guidelines.
  - It works with functions ℝ → ℝ with ContinuousOn [0,1] rather than elements of the continuous function space C([0,1],ℝ); this is a standard formalization choice and conveys the same mathematical content.
  - The linearity equality is stated for all y ∈ ℝ (even stronger), which implies the desired equality on [0,1].
- No vacuous or fake definitions; the statement uses genuine Mathlib notions (ContinuousOn, integral over restricted Lebesgue measure).

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an essentially faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only minor strengthening of assumptions on k and a standard use of ContinuousOn rather than ContinuousMap.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {n : Nat}` sets the dimension n of the Euclidean space.
- `open EuclideanSpace` brings EuclideanSpace-related notation into scope.
- `variable {x0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)}` declares a point x0 in ℝ^n (Lean's `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is ℝ^n).
- `variable {f : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → ℝ}` declares a real-valued function on ℝ^n.
- The theorem `gradient_norm_eq_opNorm_fderiv (hf : DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0) : ‖gradient f x0‖ = (fderiv ℝ f x0).opNorm` states: If f is differentiable at x0, then the norm of the gradient of f at x0 equals the operator norm of the Fréchet derivative of f at x0.

2) Fidelity to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For f: ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable at x0, ||∇f(x0)|| = sup { |Df(x0) h| : ||h|| = 1 }. Equivalently, the gradient norm equals the operator norm of the derivative. 
- In Lean, `fderiv ℝ f x0` is the derivative as a continuous linear map L: ℝ^n → ℝ, and `L.opNorm` is the operator norm sup of ‖L h‖ over ‖h‖ ≤ 1 (which agrees with sup over the unit sphere for linear maps). For ℝ-valued linear maps, ‖L h‖ = |L h|, so this matches the sup in the statement. 
- `gradient f x0` is the standard gradient vector in ℝ^n, and its norm is ‖∇f(x0)‖.
- The hypothesis `DifferentiableAt ℝ f x0` matches the differentiability assumption.
- Thus the Lean theorem precisely formalizes the claim that the gradient’s norm equals the operator norm of the derivative.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain: ℝ^n → ℝ matches EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → ℝ.
- Assumptions: differentiable at x0 matches `DifferentiableAt`.
- Conclusion: equality of gradient norm and operator norm matches the “that is” line of the natural language statement; the sup characterization is exactly what `opNorm` encodes. No extraneous or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; everything uses Mathlib’s standard objects.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We fix a type X equipped with a topology (not necessarily a metric). This is enough to talk about continuity of functions X → ℝ.
- `open BoundedContinuousFunction Filter`: We open namespaces for bounded continuous functions and filters.
- The theorem `tendsto_dist_iff_uniform` states: For a sequence `f_seq : ℕ → BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ` and a function `f : BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ`, we have
  Tendsto (fun n => dist (f_seq n) f) atTop (𝓝 (0 : ℝ)) ↔ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : X, |(f_seq n : X → ℝ) x - (f : X → ℝ) x| ≤ ε.
  Natural language: The real sequence `dist(f_n, f)` tends to 0 if and only if for every ε > 0 there is N such that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ X, |f_n(x) − f(x)| ≤ ε. Since `dist` on `BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ` is the sup norm (coming from the existing Mathlib instance), this equivalence exactly says: convergence in the sup metric is equivalent to uniform convergence on X.
Assessment relative to the original statement:
- Original statement has two parts:
  1) Show that (C_b(X, ℝ), d) is a metric space, where d(f, g) = sup_x |f(x) − g(x)|.
  2) Show that convergence in d is equivalent to uniform convergence.
- The Lean code only addresses the second part explicitly via the stated equivalence. It does not state or prove that `(C_b(X, ℝ), d)` is a metric space. It implicitly uses the fact that there is a metric (since `dist` is used), which is provided by Mathlib through the normed structure on `BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ`. However, the code does not restate or verify this as part of the translation.
- Assumptions on X: The code assumes only `[TopologicalSpace X]`, while the original assumes `(X, d)` is a metric space. This is a harmless generalization: to talk about bounded continuous functions and uniform convergence to ℝ, a topology on X suffices. So this discrepancy is acceptable.
- The uniform convergence clause uses `≤ ε` instead of `< ε`, which is standardly equivalent and acceptable.
- No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions are introduced; the single theorem is a meaningful formalization of the uniform convergence equivalence. The proof is left as `sorry`, but per instructions we focus on the statement/translation, not the proof.
Final comparison:
- The code faithfully captures the second claim (equivalence of convergence in the sup metric and uniform convergence), stated in an equivalent form (Tendsto of `dist(f_n,f)` to 0).
- The code omits the first claim (that `(C_b(X, ℝ), d)` is a metric space). While Mathlib supplies this fact implicitly, the natural language problem explicitly asks to show it, and the code does not formalize that part.
- Therefore, the translation is incomplete: it matches only one of the two requested components.

No auxiliary definitions are introduced; both are direct statements about liminf/limsup monotonicity under pointwise ≤.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement assumes additionally that {x_n} converges, and asks to show the two inequalities liminf x ≤ liminf y and limsup x ≤ limsup y. The Lean statements assert precisely these two inequalities under the pointwise inequality assumption, and do not assume convergence. This is a slight generalization: the inequalities hold without any convergence assumption. This is an acceptable and standard strengthening; it still fully captures and implies the original claims.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Same core mathematical content: monotonicity of liminf and limsup under pointwise ≤.
- Difference: the code omits the convergence assumption on x_n present in the natural language. Since convergence is unnecessary for these inequalities, the Lean statements are stronger but faithful to the intended result. No vacuous definitions or placeholders beyond proof `sorry`. Types (ℝ-valued sequences) match typical interpretation of the statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The declaration works in the context of two topological spaces X and Y, with Y assumed to be a locally compact Hausdorff space ([LocallyCompactSpace Y] and [T2Space Y]).
- It considers a function f : X → Y with the hypotheses: hclosed : IsClosedMap f (f sends closed sets to closed sets), hcont : Continuous f, and hinj : Injective f.
- The conclusion is a Homeomorph X (↥(range f)), i.e., a homeomorphism between X and the image of f (the subtype of Y consisting of points in range f). This captures “f is a homeomorphism onto its image.”

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space and f : X → Y a closed injection. Prove that f is a homeomorphism onto its image.” In standard topology contexts, “f : X → Y” typically denotes a continuous map unless stated otherwise. The code explicitly assumes continuity (hcont), which aligns with this standard convention. The extra explicit continuity assumption in Lean is not a discrepancy if we interpret “map” as continuous.
- The assumptions [LocallyCompactSpace Y] and [T2Space Y] exactly match “locally compact Hausdorff.”
- The conclusion precisely formalizes “homeomorphism onto its image” via Homeomorph X (range f).
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all terms come from Mathlib. The statement is a straightforward formalization of the claim.

Final check:
- The Lean statement faithfully captures the intended mathematical statement, with the standard implicit continuity made explicit. No mismatch in meaning; the domain and codomain, hypotheses (closed, injective, LCH Hausdorff Y), and the conclusion match the natural language statement.

- The Lean statement matches the first part (the big-O/small-o characterization) in a “within a set” formulation: domain is `ℝ` with a side condition `x ∈ s` rather than a function `I → ℝ`, which is a standard formalization. The inequality and quantifiers over `ε, δ, x` match the intended result.

Step 3: Differences and issues.
- Missing equivalence part: The Lean code does not include the “equivalently” formulation with a function `g` tending to `0` and exact equality `|a + b(x-c) - f(x)| = |x - c| g(x)` near `c`.
- Assumption on point membership: The natural statement assumes `c ∈ I`. The Lean hypothesis uses `DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f s c`, which does not explicitly assert `c ∈ s` (only that the derivative exists along `s` at `c`, which typically implies `c ∈ closure s`). This is a slight generalization of the assumption. The conclusion is still the appropriate “within `s`” statement. This is acceptable as a mild generalization.
- Otherwise, the first part is faithfully captured, including the dependence on `x ∈ s` and the bound `≤ ε * |x - c|` for `|x - c| < δ`.

Conclusion: The code is a good formalization of the first (main) assertion but omits the equivalent characterization via a function `g` with limit zero. There is also a mild generalization in the assumption (within vs. at, without explicitly `c ∈ s`). Hence it is not fully faithful to the entire natural language statement, but it is largely accurate for the primary claim.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib, open Matrix: We use Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace.
- variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R]: Work over a commutative ring R.

Theorem 1 (ASA_transpose_diagonal):
- For any m×m matrix A over R, define S by S_{k,l} = (-1)^(k.toNat + l.toNat). Then for all indices i, j with i ≠ j, the (i,j)-entry of the product A * S * Aᵀ is 0. In words: A S Aᵀ is diagonal (since all off-diagonal entries vanish).
- Note: Fin indices run from 0 to m−1, but the parity of i+j is unchanged by shifting from 1-based to 0-based indexing, so S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j} matches the intended checkerboard sign matrix.

Theorem 2 (transpose_inverse_via_cofactor):
- If det(A) is a unit in R (equivalently, A is invertible over a commutative ring), then the matrix ((det A)^{-1}) • (A.adjugate)ᵀ is both a left and right inverse of Aᵀ:
  Aᵀ * ((det A)^{-1} • (A.adjugate)ᵀ) = 1 and ((det A)^{-1} • (A.adjugate)ᵀ) * Aᵀ = 1.
- Here (↑(h.unit⁻¹) : R) denotes the element of R corresponding to the inverse of det(A) (viewed as a unit), and (A.adjugate)ᵀ is the transpose of the adjugate. In Mathlib, adjugate A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix, so (A.adjugate)ᵀ is exactly the cofactor matrix B.
- Hence this asserts that (Aᵀ)^{-1} = (1 / det A) ⋅ B.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- First part: The statement “Show that A S Aᵀ is diagonal, where S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j}” is formalized as: for all i ≠ j, (A * S * Aᵀ) i j = 0. This is exactly the definition of being diagonal (all off-diagonal entries vanish), with the correct S.
- Second part: The statement “If A is invertible then (Aᵀ)^{-1} = (1/ det A) B” is formalized as: assuming det A is a unit, Aᵀ multiplied on both sides by (det A)^{-1} times (A.adjugate)ᵀ yields the identity. Since (A.adjugate)ᵀ is the cofactor matrix B, and (det A)^{-1} is represented by (↑(h.unit⁻¹) : R), this is the standard adjugate formula for (Aᵀ)^{-1}. Proving both left and right inverse equations is equivalent to stating it is the inverse. The assumption “det A is a unit” is equivalent to invertibility of A over a commutative ring, so this matches the natural language assumption.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Indexing: The use of Fin with 0-based indices does not change the sign pattern since parity of i+j is preserved. No issue.
- Strength of assumptions: The code assumes det(A) is a unit rather than explicitly stating A is invertible; over a commutative ring these are equivalent and this is the standard formalization. Acceptable slight generalization.
- Use of cofactors vs adjugate: The code uses (A.adjugate)ᵀ, which is exactly the cofactor matrix B. Matches the natural language.
- Both theorems are stated without vacuous placeholders or fake definitions; S is explicitly defined; no auxiliary vacuous definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully translate the natural language problem.

  This states: For any topological spaces X and Y, with Y locally compact (`[LocallyCompactSpace Y]`) and Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), if f : X → Y is a proper map (`IsProperMap f`), then f is a closed map (`IsClosedMap f`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the necessary mathematical library.
- `open ContinuousLinearMap` opens the namespace for continuous linear maps.
- The lemma `innerSL_opNorm_eq_norm {m : ℕ} (b : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)) : (innerSL ℝ b).opNorm = ‖b‖` states: For Euclidean space ℝ^m (formalized as `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)`), consider the continuous linear functional given by the inner product with a fixed vector b, i.e., x ↦ ⟪b, x⟫. Then the operator norm of this functional equals the norm of b.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: On ℝ^n with the standard Euclidean norm, let B: ℝ^n → ℝ be defined by Bx = b ⋅ x (dot product). Then ‖B‖ = ‖b‖.
- In Lean, `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)` is ℝ^m with the standard inner product; `innerSL ℝ b` is exactly the continuous linear map x ↦ ⟪b, x⟫ (the dot product). `opNorm` is the operator norm of this continuous linear map. Thus the lemma precisely states that the operator norm of the functional x ↦ b · x equals ‖b‖, matching the natural language statement.
- The use of continuous linear maps matches L(ℝ^n, ℝ); in finite dimensions linear = continuous, so this is consistent.

3) Final comparison:
- Both problems assert the same equality for the operator norm of the linear functional defined by dot product with b on ℝ^n. No discrepancies in domain/codomain, norms, or interpretation of the dot/inner product. The Lean uses standard Mathlib notions (`EuclideanSpace`, `innerSL`, `opNorm`) and does not introduce any vacuous definitions. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but per the auditing instructions we only assess the translation of the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n m : Nat}`: We work with natural numbers n, m.
- `theorem ... (A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ)) :` We fix a continuous linear map A from (Fin n → ℝ) to (Fin m → ℝ), i.e., a linear map between finite-dimensional real normed spaces with their canonical Pi-norms.
- Conclusion: `∃ x : Fin n → ℝ, ‖x‖ = 1 ∧ (‖A x‖ = A.opNorm) ∧ (∀ y, ‖y‖ = 1 → ‖A y‖ ≤ ‖A x‖) ∧ (∀ y, ‖y‖ ≤ 1 → ‖A y‖ ≤ A.opNorm) ∧ (∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ y, ‖y‖ < 1 ∧ ‖A y‖ > A.opNorm - ε)`:
  - There exists a unit vector x (‖x‖ = 1) such that ‖A x‖ = A.opNorm (the operator norm is attained at a unit vector).
  - Moreover, for all unit vectors y, ‖A y‖ ≤ ‖A x‖ (x achieves the maximum on the unit sphere).
  - For all y with ‖y‖ ≤ 1, ‖A y‖ ≤ A.opNorm (A.opNorm bounds ‖A y‖ on the closed unit ball).
  - For every ε > 0, there exists y with ‖y‖ < 1 and ‖A y‖ > A.opNorm − ε (values on the open unit ball approach the operator norm from below).

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The natural statement asserts equalities: ‖A‖ = max_{‖x‖=1} ‖Ax‖ = sup_{‖x‖≤1} ‖Ax‖ = sup_{‖x‖<1} ‖Ax‖, using compactness of the unit sphere in finite dimensions.
- The Lean theorem encapsulates exactly the content needed to conclude those equalities:
  - Existence of x with ‖x‖ = 1 and ‖A x‖ = A.opNorm together with the universal inequality on the unit sphere gives max_{‖x‖=1} ‖Ax‖ = A.opNorm and attainment of the maximum.
  - The inequality on the closed unit ball shows sup_{‖x‖≤1} ‖Ax‖ ≤ A.opNorm; the existence of a unit vector where equality holds forces equality sup_{‖x‖≤1} ‖Ax‖ = A.opNorm.
  - The ε-approximation from the open unit ball together with the trivial bound ‖A y‖ ≤ A.opNorm for ‖y‖ < 1 yields sup_{‖x‖<1} ‖Ax‖ = A.opNorm.
  - Thus, while the code states these as conjunctive properties rather than writing the equalities explicitly, they are mathematically equivalent to the chain of equalities in the natural language.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- Specialization of norms: The natural statement allows “any norm on ℝ^n” (and implicitly some norm on ℝ^m). The Lean code fixes the specific normed spaces (Fin n → ℝ) and (Fin m → ℝ) with their default Pi norms, so it proves the result only for these particular norms, not for an arbitrary choice. This is a slight specialization; the mathematical content of the equalities is the same in finite dimensions, but the generality is reduced.
- Dimension n = 0 edge case: The code claims existence of a unit vector for all n, m. For n = 0, the unit sphere is empty, so such an x does not exist. The natural statement uses “max over {‖x‖ = 1},” which implicitly presumes the unit sphere is nonempty (typically n ≥ 1). The Lean statement should ideally assume n ≠ 0. This is a small mismatch/oversight.
- Otherwise, no vacuous placeholders are used; all terms are from Mathlib and the statement is meaningful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is an essentially faithful translation of the mathematical claim (attainment on the unit sphere and equality with the suprema over closed and open unit balls), with two caveats: it is specialized to the standard norms on (Fin n → ℝ) and does not exclude the degenerate n = 0 case. Overall, it’s very close to the intended statement.

- Domain/codomain: ℝ →L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) matches L(ℝ, ℝ^n).
- Definition of A: x ↦ x • a matches Ax = x a.
- Norms: Euclidean norm on R^n and operator norm on continuous linear maps are the intended ones in Mathlib.

  This defines “proper_map f” to mean: for every subset K of Y, if K is compact in Y, then the preimage f^{-1}(K) is compact in X. This is a standard definition of a proper map in general topology.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement says: “Prove that every continuous map f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is proper.” The code exactly formalizes this, using the standard definition of proper as “pulls back compact sets to compact sets.” The assumptions ([CompactSpace X], [T2Space Y], and Continuous f) and the conclusion (proper_map f) align perfectly.

Step 3: Final comparison and discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `proper_map` is a legitimate, precise definition.
- No extraneous hypotheses: exactly compact domain, Hausdorff codomain, and continuity.
- The notion of “proper” used is the standard one in topology and matches the likely intended meaning.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `lemma jirilebl_ra_ch_several_vars_ders_2416 (n : ℕ) (A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ)) :` introduces a lemma for any natural number n and any continuous linear map A from (Fin n → ℝ) to itself. Here (Fin n → ℝ) is Lean's standard model of ℝ^n as a normed space. In finite dimension, every linear map is continuous, so using `→L` is standard to access `opNorm`.
- The statement asserts three equalities (conjoined by ∧):
  • `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm A = sSup ((fun x => ‖A x‖) '' {x : Fin n → ℝ | ‖x‖ = 1})`
    This says the operator norm equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the unit sphere {x : ‖x‖ = 1}.
  • `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm A = sSup ((fun x => ‖A x‖) '' {x : Fin n → ℝ | ‖x‖ ≤ 1})`
    This says the operator norm equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the closed unit ball.
  • `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm A = sSup ((fun x => ‖A x‖) '' {x : Fin n → ℝ | ‖x‖ < 1})`
    This says the operator norm equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the open unit ball.
- The proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but there are no auxiliary placeholder definitions; only a standard lemma statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to show that for a linear operator A on ℝ^n, the operator norm defined by the maximum over the unit sphere equals the supremum over the closed unit ball and also equals the supremum over the open unit ball. The Lean statement asserts exactly that `opNorm A` equals each of those three suprema. Using `sSup` instead of an explicit `max` on the sphere is a standard formalization choice; in finite dimensions the unit sphere is compact and the supremum is a maximum, so the meanings coincide. The domain `(Fin n → ℝ)` is a standard Lean representation of ℝ^n.

3) Final check for differences:
- Norm choice: Lean uses the canonical norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)` (the Pi/sup norm) rather than explicitly the Euclidean norm. The claim about equality of these three expressions for the operator norm holds for any norm on a finite-dimensional real vector space, so this is a harmless (slight) generalization faithful to the intended statement.
- Dimension n=0 edge case: The natural-language definition via a maximum on the unit sphere tacitly presumes the sphere is nonempty (n ≥ 1). The Lean version uses `sSup`, which is defined for all sets, so it also seamlessly handles n=0. This is again a benign generalization, not a mismatch.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; only a lemma statement with standard mathlib notions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem differentiable_at_error_bound {E : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] {f : E → ℝ} {x0 : E} {f' : E →L[ℝ] ℝ} (hf : HasFDerivAt f f' x0) : ...` 
  This sets up a real normed vector space E, a real-valued function f on E, a point x0 in E, and a continuous linear map f' from E to ℝ. The hypothesis `HasFDerivAt f f' x0` asserts that f is Fréchet differentiable at x0 with derivative f'.
- `∀ (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε), ∃ (δ : ℝ) (hδ : 0 < δ), ∀ (h : E), ‖h‖ < δ → |f (x0 + h) - f x0 - f' h| ≤ (∥f'∥ + ε) * ‖h‖` 
  For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all h with ‖h‖ < δ, the error term |f(x0+h) - f(x0) - f'(h)| is bounded by (‖f'‖ + ε)‖h‖. Here ∥f'∥ is the operator norm of the derivative f'.
- `:= by sorry` is a placeholder for the proof; no additional (vacuous) definitions are introduced.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ differentiable at x0, show |f(x0+h) − f(x0) − Df(x0)h| ≤ ‖Df(x0)‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖) as h → 0.
- The Lean statement is slightly more general (domain E is any real normed space, not just ℝ^n), which is an acceptable generalization.
- The quantitative form in Lean, “∀ ε>0, eventually |error| ≤ (‖f'‖ + ε)‖h‖,” is equivalent to the small-o statement “|error| ≤ ‖f'‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖)”. Indeed, the former is the standard ε-δ formulation of a bound of the form at most (‖f'‖ + ε) times ‖h‖ for small h, which is exactly the meaning of adding a term vanishing like o(‖h‖).
- The objects correspond: f' is Df(x0), f' h is Df(x0)h, and ∥f'∥ is the operator norm.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: generalization from ℝ^n to an arbitrary real normed space E. This is a benign generalization and maintains faithfulness.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem with a placeholder proof. The quantitative statement matches the intended “≤ ‖Df(x0)‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖)” formulation.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully formalizes the given natural language statement (in slightly greater generality).

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library.
- `open Function` opens the Function namespace (for notions like Bijective, etc.).
- The theorem `continuous_bij_on_compact_t2_is_homeomorph` is stated for arbitrary types `X` and `Y` equipped with topologies, with assumptions `[CompactSpace X]` (X is compact) and `[T2Space Y]` (Y is Hausdorff). It fixes a function `f : X → Y` and assumes `hf : Continuous f` (f is continuous) and `hb : Bijective f` (f is bijective). The conclusion is `IsHomeomorph f`, i.e., f is a homeomorphism.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""A continuous bijection f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism."" The Lean theorem hypotheses match exactly: compact domain, Hausdorff codomain, continuity, bijectivity. The conclusion is that f is a homeomorphism. This precisely reflects the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The predicate `IsHomeomorph f` is the formal way to assert that f is a homeomorphism. This matches the intended meaning.
- The code is a direct formalization with no generalization or specialization beyond the original statement.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter Topology Set`: Brings in Mathlib and opens relevant namespaces for topology, filters, and sets.
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X]`: Let X be a type equipped with a metric space structure; i.e., X is a metric space.
- The theorem `sequentially_compact_metric_implies_compact` states: Assume sequential compactness in the form `hseq : ∀ (u : ℕ → X), ∃ x : X, ∃ s : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono s ∧ Tendsto (u ∘ s) atTop (𝓝 x)`, i.e., for every sequence u in X there exists a point x in X and a strictly increasing subsequence selector s such that the subsequence u ∘ s converges to x. The conclusion is `IsCompact (univ : Set X)`, i.e., the whole space X, viewed as the set univ, is compact.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
The natural statement: Let X be a metric space and suppose X is sequentially compact. Prove that every open cover of X admits a finite subcover. In Mathlib, `IsCompact (univ : Set X)` is exactly the compactness of the whole space X, which is equivalent to “every open cover of X has a finite subcover.” The hypothesis `hseq` captures the standard definition of sequential compactness (every sequence has a convergent subsequence). Thus the theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Hypotheses: Both assume X is a metric space and sequentially compact. Match.
- Conclusion: Natural language states the open cover characterization of compactness; Lean states `IsCompact univ`, an equivalent formalization. Match.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions or placeholders are introduced. All used notions (StrictMono, Tendsto, atTop, 𝓝, IsCompact) are standard Mathlib definitions.
There are no discrepancies. The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard topology library.
- Comment explains the intent: show that X × Y is compact, which is equivalent to saying every open cover has a finite subcover.
- `theorem compact_space_prod {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : CompactSpace X → CompactSpace Y → CompactSpace (X × Y) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem: for any types X and Y equipped with topological space structures, if X is compact and Y is compact (as `CompactSpace` instances), then their product X × Y is compact as a `CompactSpace`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement: ""Let X and Y be compact topological spaces. Prove that every open cover of X × Y has a finite subcover."" In Lean, `CompactSpace (X × Y)` is exactly the assertion that the whole space X × Y is compact, which is equivalent to the open cover formulation. The hypotheses are that X and Y are compact (`CompactSpace X` and `CompactSpace Y`). Therefore, the theorem statement exactly matches the mathematical content of the natural language statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No extraneous assumptions (like Hausdorff) are added.
- No weakening or strengthening: the product compactness is equivalent to the open-cover finite subcover property in Mathlib's `CompactSpace` framework.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the code uses established Mathlib concepts (`TopologicalSpace`, `CompactSpace`).
Thus, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem closed_bounded_compact {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] {S : Set X}`: Let X be a metric space and S a subset of X.
- `(h_closed : IsClosed S)`: Assume S is closed.
- `(h_bounded : ∃ (x0 : X) (R : ℝ), 0 < R ∧ S ⊆ Metric.ball x0 R)`: Assume S is bounded in the sense that there exists a point x0 and radius R > 0 such that S is contained in the open ball centered at x0 of radius R.
- `: IsCompact S`: Conclude that S is compact.
- `by sorry`: No proof is provided; only the statement is given.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claim is: In a metric space X, if S is closed and bounded, then S is compact. The Lean statement asserts exactly this: in any metric space X, given S closed and contained in some open ball (a standard equivalent formulation of boundedness in metric spaces), conclude IsCompact S. The use of an open ball with R > 0 is a common and equivalent formalization of boundedness in metric spaces (alternatively one can use closed balls or the bornological definition; they are equivalent in this context). Thus the formal statement matches the informal one.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Domain: arbitrary metric space X — matches.
- Hypotheses: S is closed — matches; S is bounded — represented as S ⊆ ball x0 R with R > 0, which is equivalent to boundedness — matches.
- Conclusion: S is compact — matches.
No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement with an omitted proof. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib`, `universe u`, `open Topology`: Set up environment and namespaces.
- `class LocallySimplyConnectedSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop`: Introduces a new typeclass predicate intended to mean ""X is locally simply connected."" However, it has no fields and no definition; as a structure with no fields in Prop, it is effectively a trivial/opaque placeholder that can be inhabited without any real content. It does not encode the usual mathematical condition.
- Theorem `compact_locally_simply_connected_fundamental_group_fg`: For any type `X` with a topological space structure, if `X` is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`) and (by hypothesis) locally simply connected (`[LocallySimplyConnectedSpace X]`), then for any basepoint `x : X`, the fundamental group `FundamentalGroup X x` is finitely generated (`Group.FG`). The proof is omitted via `sorry`, which is allowed for this audit as long as the statement is faithful.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""Show that every compact, locally simply connected topological space has finitely generated fundamental group."" The code’s theorem statement matches this in form: it asserts finite generation of the fundamental group at each basepoint under compactness and local simple connectivity.
- However, the critical issue is the auxiliary definition `LocallySimplyConnectedSpace`. It is an empty class (no fields), serving as a placeholder and not the true Mathlib notion of locally simply connected. This is a vacuous/opaque predicate that does not faithfully represent the intended topological property. Per the guidelines, such placeholders make the translation unfaithful.

3) Final comparison:
- Mathematically intended: assumes the actual standard notion of locally simply connected.
- Code: assumes an ad hoc, vacuous typeclass that can be instantiated without any content, hence not the real condition.
- Therefore, despite the overall shape of the theorem matching the English statement, the key hypothesis is not faithfully formalized.

Conclusion: The translation fails due to the vacuous auxiliary definition. If that placeholder were replaced by a legitimate definition of local simple connectivity from Mathlib, the theorem statement would be faithful. Hence, this merits a mid-level grade per rubric.

  Natural language: For any types X and Y equipped with topological space structures, the product space X × Y is a compact space if and only if X and Y are each compact spaces. Here `CompactSpace α` is Mathlib’s standard typeclass expressing “the whole space α is compact.”

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement says: If X and Y are topological spaces, then X × Y is compact iff X and Y are both compact. The Lean statement precisely formalizes this using `CompactSpace (X × Y)` and `CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y` under `[TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`. The product topology is the default instance on `X × Y` in Mathlib. There are no extraneous hypotheses or weakening/strengthening: it is exactly the intended equivalence.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The only construct is a theorem statement, with a `sorry` proof placeholder. The translation task is about the statement, not the proof.

3) Final check for differences:
- Both statements concern whole-space compactness; Lean uses `CompactSpace` appropriately. No separation axioms are assumed or needed. The equivalence is stated, matching the “iff” in the natural language. The scope (arbitrary topological spaces X, Y) matches exactly. No discrepancies.

The body uses `sorry`, so no proof is provided, but the statement is clear.

This is a standard formulation of linearity in a single row via `Function.update` that replaces the i-th row of A by the given function.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement has two parts:
  (a) A combinatorial inequality involving a subset S of entries of A: if S always contains two entries from the same row or always contains two entries from the same column, then a certain sum of absolute values of determinant terms restricted to S is bounded by a related sum with one entry removed. This is a purely combinatorial property.
  (b) Using (a), conclude that the determinant is multilinear in the rows (i.e., linear in each row separately with other rows fixed).

- The Lean code only states (b): linearity in the i-th row. It does not formalize or even mention the combinatorial inequality (a), nor any notion of ""absolute value"" or sums over determinant terms. There is no treatment of subsets S of entries, nor the combinatorial condition about rows/columns.
- Moreover, the code is over a general commutative ring R, which is appropriate for multilinearity but makes it impossible to state the absolute value inequality of (a). This further indicates that the first part is omitted.

3) Conclusion: The code captures only the second conclusion (multilinearity in a row), and not the first combinatorial inequality, nor the logical structure ""Use this to prove..."". Therefore, as a translation of the full natural language statement, it is not faithful. It is a partial translation of the final consequence only. There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions; the theorem statement for multilinearity is correct, but it omits the main combinatorial content and justification.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- `variable {n : Nat}`: Fixes a natural number n, the dimension.
- `variable (R S T : Set (Fin n -> Real)) (f : (Fin n -> Real) -> Real)`: Declares sets R, S, T in R^n (represented as functions `Fin n → Real`) and a function f from R^n to Real.

The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is about rectangles R', R'' in R^n with R = R' ∪ R'' also a rectangle, and R' ∩ R'' being a degenerate rectangle (one side length 0), hence zero volume. It concludes that if f is Riemann integrable on R' and R'', then f is Riemann integrable on R and the integral over R equals the sum of integrals over R' and R''.
- The Lean code only speaks about arbitrary sets S, T, R with R = S ∪ T and assumes Volume(S ∩ T) = 0. It does not assert that S, T, R are rectangles nor that S ∩ T is a rectangle with one side length 0. This is a generalization (dropping “rectangle” conditions and keeping only the zero-volume intersection), which could be acceptable as a harmless generalization if the underlying notions were correct.
- However, the code introduces entirely new, uninterpreted symbols `RiemannIntegrableOn`, `RiemannIntegral`, and `Volume`. They are not Mathlib’s standard definitions, nor are they defined in terms of them. This makes the statement vacuous as a translation of the original mathematics, because these constants have no semantics connecting them to Riemann integration or geometric volume.
- Therefore, the code does not legitimately formalize the mathematical content. It does not use Mathlib’s notions of Riemann integrability on rectangles/boxes, nor Mathlib’s measure/volume. It replaces crucial concepts with placeholders, which violates the guidelines.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The Lean code does not require S, T, R to be rectangles; the original does. This is a generalization and could be fine on its own.
  - The intersection condition “rectangle with one side of length 0” is replaced by the single condition `Volume (S ∩ T) = 0`. This captures the intended consequence, so this change alone could be acceptable.
  - The most serious issue: the code uses newly declared constants for integrability, integral, and volume, not Mathlib’s definitions, making the statement unmoored from the intended Riemann integration framework. This is a placeholder approach and not a faithful formalization.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation due to the use of uninterpreted constants for core mathematical notions and the absence of legitimate Mathlib definitions. Even though the high-level logical shape resembles the original theorem, the formalization is not legitimate per the guidelines.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: brings in the math library.
- The docstring states: ""A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff (T2) space is a homeomorphism.""
- The declaration
  `def continuous_bijective_compact_to_T2_homeomorph {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]
    [CompactSpace X] [T2Space Y] {f : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hb : Function.Bijective f) : Homeomorph X Y := by
    sorry`
  reads as: For topological spaces X and Y, with X compact and Y Hausdorff (T2), and a function f : X → Y, if f is continuous and bijective, then we define (i.e., produce) a homeomorphism between X and Y.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- Conceptually, this matches the natural language statement, which asserts that a continuous bijection f from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism. In Lean, a standard way to express “f is a homeomorphism” is to produce a `Homeomorph X Y` whose underlying function is f (typically via `Equiv.ofBijective f hb`).
- However, there are two issues:
  1) The body is `sorry`. Per the guidelines, using `sorry` makes the definition vacuous; this fails the requirement that auxiliary definitions not be placeholders. This alone makes the translation fail.
  2) The type only returns `Homeomorph X Y` and does not explicitly state that the homeomorphism’s underlying function is f. While a correct implementation would indeed build the homeomorphism from f (so the coercion is definitionally f), this is not visible from the statement as written and, combined with the `sorry`, we cannot confirm it. This is a minor faithfulness concern compared to the `sorry` issue.

Final comparison:
- If the `sorry` were replaced with the standard construction (using `Equiv.ofBijective f hb` and proving continuity of the inverse using compact-to-T2), the result would be a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. As written, with `sorry`, it fails the guideline.

Grade rationale:
- The statement is on the right track and would be faithful if completed, but it uses a vacuous placeholder. According to the rubric, that yields a mid score: 6.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Load Mathlib.

- `open Topology`: Open the Topology namespace.
- The theorem:
  `theorem one_point_compactification_Rn_homeo_Sn (n : ℕ)

    Nonempty (Homeomorph (Option (Fin n → ℝ)) { x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // ‖x‖ = 1 }) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any natural number n, assuming an arbitrary topological space structure on the type `Option (Fin n → ℝ)` and an arbitrary topological space structure on the subtype `{x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // ‖x‖ = 1}`, there exists a homeomorphism between these two topological spaces. The proof is omitted.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement is specific: the one-point compactification of ℝ^n (with its standard topology) is homeomorphic to the unit sphere S^n in ℝ^{n+1} (with its standard subspace topology from the Euclidean norm/topology).
- The code does not use the canonical one-point compactification topology. In Mathlib, the one-point compactification is modeled by `OnePoint α` (a type synonym of `Option α`) equipped with a specific, canonical topology induced from `α`. The code instead uses the raw type `Option (Fin n → ℝ)` with an arbitrary `[TopologicalSpace (Option (Fin n → ℝ))]`. This is not tied to the one-point compactification topology and could be any topology, so the statement is not the intended one.
- Similarly, the sphere is written as the subtype `{ x : Fin (n+1) → ℝ // ‖x‖ = 1 }`, but the code supplies an arbitrary topological space structure `[TopologicalSpace { ... }]` rather than the subspace topology induced from the (Euclidean) topology on `Fin (n+1) → ℝ`. Thus, the codomain topology is also unconstrained and not necessarily the standard one for the unit sphere.
- Even aside from the arbitrary topologies, using `Fin (n+1) → ℝ` with `‖·‖` refers to the default norm on the function space (which is typically the sup norm), whereas the unit sphere S^n is normally taken with the Euclidean norm. While in finite dimensions the topologies coincide and the sup-norm sphere is homeomorphic to the Euclidean sphere, the code never ties the topology on the subtype to the induced topology from any norm; it explicitly abstracts it as any `TopologicalSpace`, which breaks faithfulness.
- Therefore, the theorem as stated claims something much stronger (and generally false): existence of a homeomorphism for any choices of topologies on those underlying types. It does not encode the canonical structures needed for the original theorem.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Original: specific canonical topologies (one-point compactification of ℝ^n and the standard unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}).
- Code: arbitrary topologies on `Option (Fin n → ℝ)` and on the subtype `{x | ‖x‖ = 1}`; also uses `Option` instead of the `OnePoint` type that carries the intended topology.
- Conclusion: The code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement. It misses the essential topological structures and thus changes the problem.

Grade rationale: No vacuous placeholder definitions are introduced, but the core statement is significantly altered by abstracting away the crucial canonical topologies and using `Option` rather than `OnePoint`. This is a substantial mismatch, hence a low grade.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib.
- `variable (LocallySimplyConnected : Type -> Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate on types, intended to mean ""X is locally simply connected"" but not tied to any topology or Mathlib notion.
- `variable (fundamental_group : Type -> Type)`: Introduces an arbitrary type-valued function on types, intended to denote the fundamental group of X, but not tied to Mathlib’s fundamental group (which depends on a topological structure and typically a basepoint).

- The theorem:

  Translated: For any type X equipped with a topology, compactness, and path-connectedness, if X satisfies the predicate `LocallySimplyConnected`, then the predicate `FinitelyGenerated` holds of `fundamental_group X`. There is no proof (sorry), but we only audit the statement.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that the fundamental group of any compact, path connected, and locally simply connected topological space is finitely generated.""
- Issues:
  - `LocallySimplyConnected` is a completely free predicate on `Type`, not a property of a topological space (it ignores the `TopologicalSpace X` structure). This breaks the intended meaning.
  - `fundamental_group` is a free function from `Type` to `Type`, unrelated to Mathlib’s fundamental group (which at minimum depends on the topology and often a base point). There is no guarantee it really is the fundamental group.
  - `FinitelyGenerated` is a free predicate on `Type`, not the standard group-theoretic finite generation predicate, and not tied to any `Group` structure.
  - Thus, the statement is formulated entirely in terms of placeholders rather than Mathlib’s actual concepts. Even though the shape of the theorem mirrors the English sentence, it does not formally express that the actual fundamental group (as defined in Mathlib) is finitely generated.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s fundamental group; instead, it uses an arbitrary function `fundamental_group : Type -> Type` with no relation to topology or groups.
  - The property `LocallySimplyConnected` is not tied to the given topological structure on X.
  - The property `FinitelyGenerated` is not tied to a group structure or Mathlib’s notion of finite generation.
  - Therefore, the formal statement is not a legitimate, faithful formalization of the original statement. It effectively asserts an arbitrary predicate about an arbitrary type-valued function, not the intended topological/algebraic claim.

Given the placeholders, the translation fails the faithfulness requirement. If these placeholders were replaced by Mathlib’s actual notions (a bona fide locally simply connected property, the fundamental group construction, and finite generation for groups), then the final theorem statement would match the natural language. As-is, it is not faithful.

  Natural language: For any topological spaces X and Y, if X is compact and Y is Hausdorff (T2), and f : X → Y is continuous, then f is a proper map (as captured by Mathlib's predicate `IsProperMap f`). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement says: ""Prove that every continuous map f: X → Y from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is proper.""
- The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: it universally quantifies over X, Y with topologies, assumes X is compact (`[CompactSpace X]`) and Y is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`), assumes `f` is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`), and concludes `IsProperMap f`.
- `T2Space` is Mathlib's standard typeclass for Hausdorff spaces. `IsProperMap` is Mathlib's standard predicate for proper maps. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check: Are the two statements the same?
- Yes. The Lean theorem is a precise formalization of the English statement. No extra assumptions or restrictions are added, and no weakening occurs. The omission of the proof via `sorry` is acceptable per the task's instruction, as the focus is on the correctness of the statement, not the proof.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful and uses standard Mathlib notions appropriately.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library with standard topology definitions such as `TopologicalSpace` and `CompactSpace`.
- `universe u v` sets up universe levels for types.
- The theorem `prod_compact_iff_prod_of_compact_compact` states an equivalence between two global propositions about products and compactness:
  Left side: `(∀ {ι : Type u} {X : ι → Type v} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)], CompactSpace (∀ i, X i))`.
  This says: For every index type ι and every family of types X with a topological space structure on each X i, the product space (the Pi type Π i, X i, written as `∀ i, X i` in Lean) is compact, i.e., the whole product space has the `CompactSpace` instance.
  Right side: `(∀ {ι : Type u} {X : ι → Type v} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)], (∀ i, CompactSpace (X i)) → CompactSpace (∀ i, X i))`.
  This says: For every index type ι and every family of types X with topologies, if each factor space X i is compact (`CompactSpace (X i)` for all i), then the product space Π i, X i is compact.
- The proof is `by sorry`, but for this task we only assess the statement/translation, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: ""Prove that every product of topological spaces is compact if and only if a product of compact topological spaces is compact."" The Lean theorem exactly formalizes this as an equivalence between:
- ""every product of (arbitrary) topological spaces is compact"" and
- ""every product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
It uses standard Mathlib notions `TopologicalSpace` and `CompactSpace`, and represents products as Π-types. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions.

3) Final check:
The two statements match in meaning. Any potential ambiguity about ""product"" (finite vs. arbitrary) is resolved in Lean by quantifying over an arbitrary index type ι and using the full Π-product; this aligns with the usual meaning of ""product of topological spaces"" in generality. The code does not introduce any unintended constraints. Thus, the translation is faithful.

- `def sequentially_compact_space : Prop := ∀ (u : ℕ → X), ∃ (φ : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono φ ∧ ∃ x : X, Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)`: Define “X is sequentially compact” to mean: for every sequence u: ℕ → X, there exists a strictly increasing function φ: ℕ → ℕ (a subsequence selector) and a point x in X such that the subsequence (u ∘ φ) converges to x (i.e., tends to the neighborhood filter nhds x as n → ∞).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is exactly: a metric space X is compact if and only if X is sequentially compact. The Lean theorem states `CompactSpace X ↔ sequentially_compact_space X` under a `[MetricSpace X]` assumption. This matches precisely.
- The definition of sequential compactness used (every sequence has a convergent subsequence) is the standard one for metric spaces. The use of `StrictMono φ` correctly encodes subsequences, and `Tendsto (u ∘ φ) atTop (nhds x)` is the formalization of convergence to x.
- Using `CompactSpace X` to express compactness of the whole space is standard and equivalent to `IsCompact (univ : Set X)`.

Checks for red flags or discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the sequential compactness definition is meaningful and standard.
- No extraneous auxiliary definitions; the only auxiliary is the legitimate definition of sequential compactness.
- Scope matches: the statement is about the entire metric space X, not subsets, which aligns with the natural language.
- The code’s level of generality matches exactly (metric spaces).

Conclusion:
- The Lean code faithfully formalizes the natural language statement. There are no discrepancies.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {f : ℝ → ℝ}` introduces a function f, but it is never used afterwards.
- `variable (integrable_on_interval : ℝ → Prop)` is an arbitrary predicate on real numbers, presumably intended to mean “f is Riemann integrable on [0, M]”, but there is no connection to f.
- `variable (interval_integral : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)` is an arbitrary function of two real variables to ℝ, presumably intended to represent the definite integral ∫_a^b f, but it is completely unconstrained and not tied to f.
- `variable (has_finite_L1 : Prop)` is an arbitrary proposition, presumably intended to mean ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞, but again there is no link to f.
- The lemma `improper_integral_exists_iff_tails` assumes `h_int : ∀ M, integrable_on_interval M` and `h_L1 : has_finite_L1` (neither used in the statement) and claims the equivalence: existence of a limit `Tendsto (fun R => interval_integral 0 R) atTop (nhds I)` iff for every ε > 0, there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, `abs (interval_integral M R) < ε`.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The informal statement is: Given f is Riemann integrable on every [0, M] and ∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞, show that the improper integral ∫_0^∞ f exists iff the tails ∫_M^R f become arbitrarily small uniformly in R ≥ M.
- The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s real integral notions (e.g., Riemann or Lebesgue integrals), nor does it connect `integrable_on_interval`, `interval_integral`, or `has_finite_L1` to f. These are arbitrary placeholders/variables.
- Crucially, the lemma’s equivalence depends on the additivity property of the integral: ∫_M^R f = (∫_0^R f) − (∫_0^M f). The code does not assume any such relation between `interval_integral M R` and the net `R ↦ interval_integral 0 R`.
- The hypotheses `h_int` and `h_L1` are not used at all in the statement or (there is no proof) and thus are vacuous placeholders, not real Mathlib concepts.
- f is declared but never used. The code avoids actual Mathlib definitions and thus does not faithfully formalize the natural language assumptions.

Final comparison:
- The shapes of the two sides of the equivalence somewhat mirror the intended result: left side is existence of an improper integral (as a limit), right side is a tail estimate. However, because `interval_integral` is completely unconstrained and not tied to f or to an additive integral, the Lean statement is not the same mathematical statement.
- Moreover, the natural language assumptions (Riemann integrability on [0, M] and absolute integrability) are not represented by Mathlib notions and are not used.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It uses arbitrary placeholders instead of Mathlib definitions, does not connect key notions to f, and omits essential structural properties (additivity) that make the equivalence true.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `{X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] {x : X}`: We have a topological space X and a chosen basepoint x ∈ X.

- `(s : Set (Set X))`: There is a collection s of subsets of X (intended to be a basis).
- `(hb : TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis s)`: s is a topological basis for X. In Mathlib, this ensures in particular that every U ∈ s is open and s generates the topology.
- `(hs_count : Countable s)`: The basis s is countable.
- `(hs_simply : ∀ U ∈ s, SimplyConnectedSpace (Subtype U))`: For every U in the basis s, the subspace U (with the subspace topology, represented as `Subtype U`) is simply connected. Since elements of a topological basis are open, this matches “simply connected open sets.”
- Conclusion: `Countable (FundamentalGroup X x)`: The fundamental group of X at the basepoint x is countable.

Faithfulness check:
- Natural language: “Let X be a path connected topological space that admits a countable basis of simply connected open sets. Show that π1(X) is countable.”
- Lean: Assumes X is path connected; there exists a countable topological basis s; each basic open set U ∈ s is simply connected (as a subspace). Concludes the fundamental group at a basepoint x is countable.
- The slight formalization detail of specifying a basepoint x is standard; in path connected spaces, fundamental groups at different basepoints are isomorphic, so stating countability at a chosen x is faithful to the intended statement.
- “Open” is ensured by `IsTopologicalBasis`. “Admits” is encoded by providing such an s as data; this is an equivalent formalization.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; all Mathlib concepts are standard: `PathConnectedSpace`, `TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis`, `Countable`, `SimplyConnectedSpace`, `FundamentalGroup`.

Final comparison: The Lean theorem statement matches the natural language statement in mathematical meaning, with only standard formalization details (choice of basepoint, subspace representation). There are no discrepancies that affect meaning.

- `theorem equalizer_of_continuous_is_closed {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y] {f g : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : IsClosed {x | f x = g x} := by sorry`
  • Types X, Y with topological structures.
  • `[T2Space Y]`: Y is Hausdorff.
  • `f g : X → Y` with `hf` and `hg` denoting their continuity.
  • Conclusion: the set `{x | f x = g x}` is closed in X.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
This precisely matches the natural language statement: given topological spaces X, Y, continuous f, g, and Y Hausdorff, the equalizer set A = {x ∈ X | f(x) = g(x)} is closed in X. The Lean statement uses `IsClosed {x | f x = g x}` which is exactly the set A. The T2Space typeclass encodes Hausdorff. No extra assumptions or omissions.

3) Final check:
The mathematical content is the same. The only cosmetic difference is that the Lean statement does not introduce a name `A` for the set, but directly asserts it is closed. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are present. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- import Mathlib / open Set: Brings in Mathlib and set-theoretic notation. No content change.

  Translation: Let X and Y be topological spaces, assume X is Hausdorff (T2Space X). Let f, g : X → Y be continuous maps. Assume the set {x ∈ X | f x = g x} is dense in X. Then f = g as functions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: Let X be a Hausdorff space and Y any topological space. If continuous maps f, g : X → Y agree on a dense subset of X, prove that f = g.
- Hausdorff assumption: On X. Matches hX : T2Space X.
- Y is any topological space: Matches [TopologicalSpace Y] with no separation assumptions.
- f and g are continuous: Matches hf and hg.
- Agree on a dense subset: The code assumes Dense {x | f x = g x}, i.e., the equalizer set is dense. This is equivalent to the existence of a dense subset on which they agree, since the equalizer itself is a dense subset on which they agree, and any dense subset S where f=g would imply the equalizer contains S and is therefore dense.
- Conclusion f = g: Matches.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The hypotheses and conclusion exactly mirror the natural language statement, including the Hausdorff assumption on X rather than on Y.
- The use of the dense equalizer set is a faithful and standard formalization of “agree on a dense subset.”
- No generalization or specialization beyond the original statement.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that if X is compact and f : X → Y is continuous, then f is closed.""
- The Lean code states the same but with an added assumption that Y is Hausdorff (`[T2Space Y]`). It concludes `IsClosedMap f` from `Continuous f` under compactness of X and Hausdorffness of Y.
- This is the standard correct formulation: to conclude that images of closed sets are closed under a continuous map from a compact space, one needs Y to be Hausdorff so that compact subsets of Y are closed. Without the Hausdorff assumption the original statement is false.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: The code adds the hypothesis `[T2Space Y]` (Y is Hausdorff), which is not explicitly in the natural language statement.
- This is a slight strengthening/specialization that makes the statement correct. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the statement directly uses standard Mathlib notions (`CompactSpace`, `T2Space`, `Continuous`, `IsClosedMap`).
- Thus the code is a faithful formalization up to adding the necessary Hausdorff condition.

Given the minor added hypothesis, which is standard and necessary, this counts as a near-perfect, essentially faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We have two types X and Y with topological space structures.
- `variable (path_conn_X : Prop) (path_conn_Y : Prop) (hausdorff_X : Prop) (hausdorff_Y : Prop)`: Introduces four arbitrary propositions meant to stand for “X is path connected”, “Y is path connected”, “X is Hausdorff”, “Y is Hausdorff”. These are not tied to Mathlib definitions (e.g., PathConnectedSpace, T2Space), and are not assumed or used; they are just placeholders.
- `variable (f : X → Y) (is_covering : Prop) (x0 : X) (y0 : Y) (hy0 : y0 = f x0)`: Introduces a function f, an arbitrary proposition is_covering meant to represent “f is a covering map”, points x0, y0, and an equality y0 = f x0. Again, is_covering is just a bare Prop, not Mathlib’s CoveringMap or IsCovering.
- `variable (pi1_quot : Type*) (fiber_y0 : Type*) (map : pi1_quot → fiber_y0)`: Introduces two arbitrary types intended to represent the quotient π₁(Y, y₀)/f_*π₁(X, x₀) and the fiber X_{y₀}, and an arbitrary function map between them. No connection to the previously introduced data; these are abstract placeholders, not constructed from f, x0, y0, etc.
- `theorem covering_map_cosets_bijective : Function.Bijective map := by sorry`: States that the arbitrary function map between arbitrary types is bijective, with no hypotheses. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If X and Y are path connected Hausdorff topological spaces and f : X → Y is a covering map with y0 = f x0, then the canonical map from the coset space π₁(Y, y₀)/f_*π₁(X, x₀) to the fiber X_{y₀} is bijective.
- The Lean code does not formalize any of the required structures: no use of Mathlib’s notions of path connectedness or Hausdorffness, no CoveringMap definition, no fundamental group or its quotient, no fiber of f over y0, and no construction of the canonical map. Instead, it replaces all of these by arbitrary `Prop`s and `Type*` placeholders, and then asserts bijectivity of an arbitrary function without hypotheses.
- Moreover, the theorem claims “map is bijective” outright, not conditioned on any assumptions. This is strictly stronger (and generally false) and entirely unrelated to the specific covering-space setup.

Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The code does not encode the assumptions (path connected, Hausdorff, covering map) in any meaningful way, nor the objects (fundamental group quotient, fiber), nor the specific canonical map. It simply asserts an arbitrary function is bijective. This is not a faithful translation.

Grading rationale:
- The code uses vacuous placeholders for all essential mathematical notions and the final theorem is not even conditioned on the intended hypotheses, asserting an arbitrary function is bijective. Even if the placeholders were replaced by real definitions, the current theorem statement would still be wrong/non-faithful. This matches the rubric for a low score where vacuous placeholders make the statement unfaithful.

- Discrepancies:
  - The code uses axioms for universal cover, deck transformation group, and fundamental group, with no dependence on X. This misses the entire relationship to the given space X. 
  - Locally simply connected is not assumed as a property of X or used.
  - No group structures are provided; the final statement is an equivalence of types (≃), not an isomorphism of groups (≃*), so it does not capture the group-theoretic content.
  - The action “[x]·[y] = [x*y]” is not encoded or referenced in the final statement. The action axiom is standalone and unused.
  - The basepoint for π₁ is not specified; in Mathlib, fundamentalGroup depends on a basepoint.
  - The final def has no parameters and thus does not depend on the assumptions about X. 
  - The proof is a sorry, but even ignoring that (since we only care about the statement), the statement itself is not the correct formal translation.

3) Final check:
- The Lean code does not faithfully formalize the natural language statement. It replaces essential notions with unrelated axioms, omits the dependence on X and the locally simply connected hypothesis, lacks group structures, and asserts only a type equivalence rather than a group isomorphism with the specified action. These are substantial mismatches.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and sets up universes u and v. It opens the Topology namespace.
- The first theorem:
  theorem ContractibleSpace.connected {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (h : ContractibleSpace X) : ConnectedSpace X := by sorry
  Natural language: For any topological space X, if X is contractible (ContractibleSpace X), then X is connected (ConnectedSpace X). This directly matches ""every contractible space is connected.""
- The second theorem:
  theorem ContractibleSpace.homotopy_groups_subsingleton {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] {x : X}
    (h : ContractibleSpace X) (N : Type v) : Subsingleton (HomotopyGroup N X x) := by sorry
  Natural language: For any topological space X and any basepoint x in X, if X is contractible, then for any index N the homotopy group HomotopyGroup N X x is a subsingleton (i.e., has at most one element), hence trivial. This captures ""has trivial homotopy groups"" with explicit basepoint dependence, which is standard for homotopy groups. The variable x is an implicit parameter and thus universally quantified. The index N is general here; assuming the code compiles, this is a (possibly slightly more general) formulation of triviality of all homotopy groups.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original asks to prove that every contractible space is connected and has trivial homotopy groups. The Lean code provides exactly two theorems matching these two claims: one asserting connectedness from contractibility, and one asserting triviality (as subsingleton) of homotopy groups at any basepoint.
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only theorem statements with omitted proofs (by sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions. The terms ContractibleSpace, ConnectedSpace, and HomotopyGroup are assumed to be from Mathlib since the code compiles.
- The possible slight generalization is that the homotopy group is indexed by a type N rather than explicitly by a natural number n ≥ 0. Given compilation, this aligns with Mathlib's design for HomotopyGroup and remains faithful. Even if it is a slight generalization, such generalizations are acceptable.

Final check:
- The two math problems (natural language and Lean statements) are the same in meaning. No discrepancies: connectedness is exactly captured, and trivial homotopy groups are captured via Subsingleton of HomotopyGroup for each index and basepoint.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- import Mathlib: Using Mathlib's topology library.
- The docstring explicitly says this is a high-level statement with placeholders and no proof.
- class LocallySimplyConnectedSpace (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := (dummy : True): Introduces a class meant to represent ""locally simply connected"" but it is vacuous: any space can be given an instance since the only required field is True.
- def IsCoveringMapPlaceholder ... (p : Y → X) : Prop := True: A predicate intended to mean ""p is a covering map"" but it is defined as True, hence vacuous.
- theorem exists_universal_cover {X} [TopologicalSpace X] [PathConnectedSpace X] [LocallySimplyConnectedSpace X] : ∃ (Y : Type*) (tY : TopologicalSpace Y) (p : Y → X), IsCoveringMapPlaceholder p ∧ SimplyConnectedSpace Y := by sorry: The statement claims that for any topological space X which is path connected and (according to the placeholder class) locally simply connected, there exists a type Y with a topological structure and a map p : Y → X such that p is a covering map (placeholder, i.e., True) and Y is simply connected. Proof omitted via sorry.

Step 2: Assess fidelity to the natural language statement.
The intended statement: ""Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space X has a universal covering space X~ → X."" A universal cover is typically a simply connected covering space over X.
The Lean statement mirrors the structure (existence of Y, a topological structure, a map p to X, with Y simply connected and p a covering map). However, two crucial predicates are placeholders:
- LocallySimplyConnectedSpace is vacuous (always True), so the hypothesis does not capture the intended assumption.
- IsCoveringMapPlaceholder is vacuous (always True), so the conclusion does not actually assert that p is a covering map.
Thus, while the shape of the theorem matches, the core mathematical content is missing.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- The code makes up vacuous definitions for both ""locally simply connected"" and ""covering map"". This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions not be vacuous.
- Because of these placeholders, the theorem as stated does not faithfully express the original mathematical statement. If these placeholders were replaced by Mathlib's genuine notions (and one omitted the sorry or kept it as an axiom), the statement would be faithful.
- The existence of the TopologicalSpace structure on Y is faithful and appropriate. The requirement that Y be simply connected aligns with ""universal cover"" in common usage (it does not state the universal property explicitly, but that is standard in many texts).

Conclusion: Not faithful due to vacuous placeholders, though the overall form matches and would be faithful if the placeholders were replaced with real definitions.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib library.
- `open Function`: Opens the `Function` namespace (for `invFun`, `Bijective`, etc.).
- The theorem statement:
  - Universes: `{X Y : Type _}` are arbitrary types.
  - `[TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are topological spaces.
  - `[Nonempty X]`: Assumes X is nonempty.
  - `[T2Space Y]`: Y is a Hausdorff (T2) space.
  - `{f : X → Y}`: A function from X to Y.
  - Hypotheses: `(hf : Continuous f)` and `(hb : Function.Bijective f)` meaning f is continuous and bijective.
  - Conclusion: `Continuous (Function.invFun f)`, i.e., the inverse function `f⁻¹ : Y → X` (realized as `invFun`) is continuous. Since `f` is bijective, `invFun f` coincides with the genuine inverse.
  - The proof is `sorry` (omitted), which is acceptable for the translation audit.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: ""Suppose that f: X → Y is a continuous bijection from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y. Prove that the inverse f^{-1}: Y → X is continuous.""
- Lean theorem: Exactly this, with the only extra assumption `[Nonempty X]`. Use of `T2Space Y` matches ""Hausdorff"". Using `Function.invFun f` matches the inverse function in the bijective case.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Differences:
  - The Lean theorem includes an additional assumption `[Nonempty X]`, which slightly specializes the statement (it excludes the empty-space edge case). Since a bijection can exist even when X and Y are empty, the original statement includes that case, but the added nonemptiness is a mild specialization and does not change the substance of the claim.
  - The inverse is expressed as `Function.invFun f`, which, under bijectivity, is the true inverse. This is faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary fake content. The statement is a direct formalization of the natural language claim (modulo the minor nonemptiness specialization).

Conclusion: The translation is faithful up to a slight specialization (Nonempty X). This is acceptable per the guidelines.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- We fix types X and Y with X equipped with a MetricSpace structure. We have a map f : X → Y and assume f is surjective.
- The theorem states there exists a PseudoMetricSpace structure m on Y such that the topology induced by the uniform structure coming from this pseudometric equals the coinduced topology on Y via f from the topology on X (which itself comes from X’s metric viewed as a pseudometric).
- Concretely: ∃ m : PseudoMetricSpace Y, Topology_of(m) = coinduced f (Topology_of(MetricSpace X)).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement asks to prove that the quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric on Y (i.e., Y is metrizable with respect to that topology).
- The Lean code proves the existence of a pseudometric on Y whose induced topology is the coinduced (quotient) topology via f. That is, it shows pseudometrizability, not metrizability.

Step 3: Are the two statements the same?
- No. The Lean statement is strictly weaker: pseudometric vs metric. A pseudometric allows distinct points at distance zero and can yield non-T1/Hausdorff topologies; a metric does not. The original claim asserts metrizability, which is stronger and in general false without extra separation assumptions. The Lean code asserts only pseudometrizability, which is generally true.
- Other aspects (surjectivity, coinduced/quotient topology) align, but the key difference in metric vs pseudometric means the translation is not faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the pseudometric vs metric mismatch. The rest is appropriate and close, so it is almost correct but not faithful to the stronger claim.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `variable {V : Type _}` introduces a type of vertices V.
- `variable (G : SimpleGraph V)` introduces a simple graph G on V.
- `[Fintype V]` assumes the vertex set V is finite (hence the graph has finitely many vertices; with SimpleGraph this implies finitely many possible edges as well).
- `variable (fundamental_group : SimpleGraph V → Type _)` introduces an arbitrary function assigning to each graph a type, intended to be the fundamental group, but this is just a placeholder with no definition.
- `variable [∀ X : SimpleGraph V, Group (fundamental_group X)]` gives each such type a group structure. Again, this is a completely general assumption, not tied to any actual construction.
- `variable (IsConnected : SimpleGraph V → Prop)` introduces an arbitrary predicate on graphs, intended to mean connectedness, but not tied to Mathlib’s actual notion.

The theorem:
- `theorem connected_finite_graph_fundamental_group_fg (h : IsConnected G) : ∃ (S : Type _) (hS : Fintype S) (φ : FreeGroup S →* fundamental_group G), Function.Surjective φ := by sorry`
  Says: If G satisfies the predicate IsConnected, then there exists a finite type S and a surjective group homomorphism from the free group on S to the (placeholder) group `fundamental_group G`. This is the usual formalization that `fundamental_group G` is finitely generated.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: “Prove that any connected finite graph has finitely generated fundamental group.” Properly, this refers to the topological fundamental group of the graph viewed as a 1-dimensional CW complex; in Mathlib, the fundamental group is defined for topological spaces and depends on a basepoint, with path-connectedness giving isomorphic groups at different basepoints.
- The code does not use Mathlib’s fundamental group, nor any notion of geometric realization of a graph as a topological space, nor a basepoint. Instead it posits an arbitrary function `fundamental_group` assigning a group to each graph. Likewise, `IsConnected` is an arbitrary predicate, not the actual `SimpleGraph.Connected`.
- Thus, the theorem is not about the genuine fundamental group; it is about an arbitrary group-valued function on graphs, making the statement vacuous in relation to the intended mathematics.
- The finite graph condition is partially reflected by `[Fintype V]`, which enforces a finite vertex set; that’s reasonable. But the core mathematical meanings (fundamental group, connectedness) are not linked to Mathlib definitions.
- Also, the fundamental group in Mathlib depends on a basepoint; the code omits any basepoint entirely. Even if one used the real fundamental group, one must address basepoints or phrase the statement up to isomorphism for connected graphs.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code uses vacuous placeholders for the key notions and therefore does not faithfully express the original statement. There are no legitimate auxiliary definitions tying `fundamental_group` or `IsConnected` to Mathlib concepts. While the form “surjection from a free group on a finite set” does match “finitely generated,” the object being generated is not the actual fundamental group.

Assessment per guidelines:
- Auxiliary placeholders are vacuous: fail.
- The overall shape of the theorem would be faithful if replaced with Mathlib’s real definitions and a basepoint: yes. Hence, if fixed, the final statement could be faithful.

Grade rationale:
- Because vacuous placeholders are used for the main concepts, the translation fails. However, if those were replaced with legitimate Mathlib notions (graph connectivity and fundamental group of the associated topological space with a chosen basepoint), the formal statement would largely match the natural language statement. This corresponds to a grade around 6 per the rubric.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- import Mathlib; open Set: Standard imports and namespace opening.
- def SmoothManifold (M : Type _) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate; it asserts every type M is a smooth manifold. This is a vacuous definition.
- def SmoothPath {M : Type _} (x : ↥(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) → M) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate for a smooth path; it asserts any function from [0,1] to M is a smooth path. Vacuous.
- def HomotopicRel {M : Type _} (x y : ↥(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) → M) (S : Set ℝ) : Prop := True: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “x and y are homotopic relative to S”; again vacuous.
- theorem path_homotopic_to_smooth (M : Type _) (hM : SmoothManifold M) (x : ↥(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) → M) : ∃ y : ↥(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) → M, SmoothPath (y) ∧ HomotopicRel x y ({0,1} : Set ℝ) := by sorry: States that for any type M (assumed to be a smooth manifold via the vacuous predicate) and any map x: [0,1] → M, there exists a y: [0,1] → M such that y is a smooth path (vacuous) and x, y are homotopic relative to {0,1} (vacuous). The proof is omitted with sorry.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Original statement: Let M be a smooth manifold and x: [0,1] → M be a path. Prove that x is homotopic relative to {0,1} to a smooth path.

Issues:
- SmoothManifold, SmoothPath, and HomotopicRel are all defined as True, so they do not encode the intended mathematical concepts. This makes the theorem vacuous and not reflective of the actual content.
- The notion of “path” is just an arbitrary function Icc → M with no continuity or endpoint constraints; the statement requires an actual path and homotopy relative to endpoints.
- Because the predicates are vacuous, the theorem statement does not capture the real mathematical claim even if the quantifiers match the superficial shape of the English statement.

Step 3: Final comparison.
The Lean code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement due to vacuous placeholders for the core concepts (smooth manifold, smooth path, homotopic relative). Even if the overall existential form resembles the claim, the meaning is lost. If these predicates were replaced by legitimate Mathlib notions, the shape of the theorem would be appropriate, but as written, it is not faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful. According to the rubric, this uses vacuous definitions; if fixed, the final theorem would be faithful, so a mid-level grade is appropriate.

  reads: For any map f : P → Q between topological spaces, if f is a proper map (preimage of compact is compact), and f is a local homeomorphism, and Q is connected as a topological space, then f is a covering map. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Every proper local diffeomorphism f : P → Q between manifolds without boundary, with Q connected, is a covering map.""
- Lean theorem: ""Every proper local homeomorphism f : P → Q between topological spaces, with Q connected, is a covering map.""
- Differences:
  - Domain/codomain structure: NL assumes smooth manifolds without boundary; Lean assumes arbitrary topological spaces (no manifold structure, no smoothness, no boundary conditions). This is a significant generalization.
  - Map type: NL assumes a local diffeomorphism (smooth with smooth inverse locally). Lean assumes a local homeomorphism (topological condition). A local diffeomorphism implies a local homeomorphism, but the Lean statement allows far more maps than smooth local diffeomorphisms.
  - Connectedness: Both assume Q is connected (Lean via `ConnectedSpace Q`), which matches the topological notion in the NL statement.
  - Properness: Present in both.

3) Conclusion: The Lean statement is a broader, more general theorem than the NL statement. While the NL statement would follow as a corollary from the Lean statement (since manifolds without boundary are topological spaces and local diffeomorphisms are local homeomorphisms), the code does not faithfully translate the exact NL statement; it asserts a stronger claim under weaker hypotheses (no manifold or smoothness assumptions). There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the statement is clean and uses standard Mathlib notions. However, due to the significant generalization beyond manifolds/local diffeomorphisms, it is not a faithful translation.

  Natural language: For any center `a ∈ ℝ²` and radius `r > 0`, we define (i.e., produce) a homeomorphism between the entire plane ℝ² and the open ball of radius `r` centered at `a`. The target `{x : ℝ × ℝ // dist x a < r}` is exactly the open ball in ℝ² with the metric-induced topology.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement says: Prove that ℝ² is homeomorphic to any open ball in ℝ². The Lean signature asserts precisely this, parametrized by any center `a` and positive radius `r`, producing a `Homeomorph` between ℝ² and the open ball `{x | dist x a < r}`. Requiring `0 < r` matches the usual meaning of “open ball”.
- Moreover, returning a `Homeomorph` is even stronger than an existence proposition—this is fully faithful (indeed slightly stronger) as a formulation.

3) Final check and discrepancies:
- The only issue is that the body is `by sorry`, i.e., a placeholder; no actual construction/proof is provided. Per the auditing guidelines, the presence of `sorry` (a vacuous placeholder) means the translation fails, despite the type accurately reflecting the natural language statement. There are no other auxiliary fake definitions, and the Mathlib notions used are standard (`Homeomorph`, `dist`, subtype open ball), and the quantifiers match “any open ball in ℝ²”.
- Thus, the mathematical content of the type matches the natural language statement, but due to the `sorry`, it does not constitute a legitimate, faithful translation under the guidelines.

Conclusion: The statement is expressed correctly in the type, but the code relies on a placeholder, so it fails the faithfulness requirement.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement is: For a topological space X and subset A, the boundary of A equals the intersection of the closures of A and X − A. In Lean, `frontier A` denotes the boundary of A, `closure A` is the closure, and `Aᶜ` is the complement of A in X (i.e., X \ A). So `closure (Aᶜ)` corresponds exactly to the closure of X − A. Thus the Lean theorem statement precisely matches the mathematical statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Boundary vs frontier: identical concept in Mathlib.
- X − A vs Aᶜ: identical as complement in X.
- Equality claimed without extra hypotheses: matches the general topological fact. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions. Therefore, the two statements are the same.

- Natural language: ""Let f : X → Y be a continuous map to a Hausdorff space Y. Prove that f is proper iff (a) every fiber f^{-1}(y) is compact, and (b) f is a closed map.""
- Lean: Assumes f is continuous and Y is Hausdorff, and asserts `IsProperMap f ↔ (∀ y, IsCompact (f⁻¹ {y})) ∧ IsClosedMap f`.
- This matches exactly: ""proper iff compact fibers and closed map."" The continuity assumption is present as a separate hypothesis (`hf : Continuous f`), which aligns with the natural language setup. The notions used (`IsProperMap`, `IsClosedMap`, `IsCompact`, `T2Space`) are standard in mathlib.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement is given.
- The assumption ""Y is Hausdorff"" is correctly represented by `[T2Space Y]`.
- Every fiber compact is represented by `IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y})`.
- Closed map is represented by `IsClosedMap f`.
- The equivalence (↔) mirrors the ""if and only if"" claim.
- The presence of `hf : Continuous f` aligns with the natural language hypothesis; even if `IsProperMap` in mathlib may already include continuity, having the continuity hypothesis stated explicitly is consistent with the problem statement and does not change the meaning.

  Natural language: For any topological space X and any map p: ℝ → X which is a covering map (hp : IsCoveringMap p), we conclude that X is homeomorphic to ℝ or to the circle (S¹). The conclusion is expressed as a disjunction of existence of a homeomorphism: either there exists a homeomorphism X ≃ ℝ or there exists a homeomorphism X ≃ Circle. `Circle` in Mathlib denotes S¹.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original: ""Prove that the only topological spaces with ℝ as a covering space are ℝ and S¹."" This means: if there exists a covering map from ℝ onto X, then X is homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹. The Lean statement assumes a specific covering map p: ℝ → X with `IsCoveringMap p`, and concludes exactly that X is homeomorphic to ℝ or Circle. This matches the intended meaning: existence of such p implies the stated classification.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions: `IsCoveringMap`, `Homeomorph`, `Circle` (S¹). No vacuous or placeholder definitions.
- No extra or missing hypotheses relative to the informal statement. The English phrase ""with ℝ as a covering space"" is captured by providing a covering map `p : ℝ → X` with `IsCoveringMap p`.
- The conclusion ""X is ℝ or S¹"" is formalized correctly as a disjunction of nonempty homeomorphisms.

Therefore, the Lean theorem is a faithful formal translation of the natural language statement. The omission of the proof (`by sorry`) is acceptable per the task, which only checks the statement.

- Docstring: Claims the one-point compactification of R^n, written as `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))`, is homeomorphic to the n-sphere viewed as the unit sphere in R^{n+1}.
- def one_point_compactification_Rn_homeo_Sn (n : ℕ) [...] : Homeomorph (WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))) ({ x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1)) // ‖x‖ = 1 }) := by sorry
  Natural language of the signature: For each natural number n, there is a specific homeomorphism between `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))` and the unit sphere `{x : ℝ^{n+1} | ‖x‖ = 1}`. The code assumes topological space structures on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` and on the sphere subtype, but notably does not assume or mention a topology on `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ...)` (this would need to be available as an instance if the code compiles). The body is `sorry`, which is acceptable here as we are checking the statement, not the proof.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement: ""Prove that the one point compactification of R^n is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n."" In Mathlib, the one-point compactification is represented by `OnePoint α` with its canonical topology, and S^n is the unit sphere in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1))`.
- The code, however, uses `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))` for the one-point compactification. In Mathlib, `WithTop` is an order-theoretic construction; the topological one-point compactification is `OnePoint`. There is no standard identification in Mathlib that says `WithTop α` carries the one-point compactification topology of `α`.
- The sphere side `{ x : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1)) // ‖x‖ = 1 }` correctly represents S^n.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Key mismatch: The domain in the Lean code is `WithTop (EuclideanSpace ...)` instead of `OnePoint (EuclideanSpace ...)`. This is a substantial conceptual error: `WithTop` is not the topological one-point compactification in Mathlib. Therefore, the formal statement does not faithfully encode the intended notion of one-point compactification.
- Minor notes: The extra topological space instance assumptions are redundant but not harmful. Using a concrete `Homeomorph` (rather than an existence statement) is fine.

Conclusion: The code is not a faithful translation because it uses `WithTop` instead of `OnePoint` for the one-point compactification. No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present, but the core concept is misrepresented.

Here E and E' are normed 𝕜-vector spaces serving as the model spaces for the manifolds, and H, H' are the model topological types. I and I' are the corresponding model-with-corners structures.

- f : M → N and hf : ContMDiff I I' ⊤ f assert that f is a smooth (C^∞) map between these manifolds with respect to the given models.
- h_dim : Module.rank 𝕜 E < Module.rank 𝕜 E' encodes that the dimension of the model space for M is strictly less than that of N; in finite-dimensional situations, this is the usual dim P < dim Q.
- The conclusion IsNowhereDense (range f) says the image of f, viewed as a subset of N, is nowhere dense in N (i.e., its closure has empty interior).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For a smooth map φ : P → Q of manifolds with dim P < dim Q, show φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.
- The code asserts exactly this, with slight generality: manifolds with corners over an arbitrary nontrivially normed field 𝕜 and using Module.rank for dimension. It concludes IsNowhereDense (range f), which is the formal counterpart of “φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.”

3) Final check and differences:
- Differences are slight generalizations: (i) general 𝕜 rather than just ℝ, and (ii) manifolds with corners rather than just boundaryless manifolds. These are acceptable generalizations per the guidelines.

- The Lean theorem states the same equivalence for subsets of general metric spaces. This is a slight generalization (metric spaces instead of specifically Euclidean spaces), which is acceptable per the guidelines. The ε-δ condition used is the standard one, with distances measured in the ambient space, which matches the subspace metric.
- `Continuous f` is exactly “preimages of open sets are open” in the induced/subspace topologies.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Difference: Generalization from Euclidean spaces to arbitrary metric spaces. This is a benign generalization; the statement remains a faithful formalization of the intended result.

",1,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- Imports and `open Topology` are standard; fine.
- The theorem `paths_concat_defined_iff` takes a topological space `X` and three maps `x y z : C(↑unitInterval, X)` (continuous maps from the unit interval to X). It states an equivalence:
  ((x.toFun 1 = y.toFun 0) ∧ (y.toFun 1 = z.toFun 0)) ↔ ((x.toFun 1 = y.toFun 0) ∧ (y.toFun 1 = z.toFun 0)).
  This is a tautology: it asserts that a conjunction is equivalent to itself. There is no mention of concatenation `*`, nor of definability. The docstring claims a relation to concatenation being defined, but the statement itself does not encode that.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The original statement: For paths x, y, z: [0,1] → X, prove that (x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined. In standard topology, this “defined” means the endpoint conditions x(1) = y(0) and y(1) = z(0) hold; then both concatenations are paths. A faithful formalization would either:
  - Use a `Path` type with concatenation defined when endpoints match and state equivalence of definability; or
  - Explicitly define what it means for the concatenations to be defined in terms of endpoint equalities and then prove the equivalence.
- The provided theorem does neither: it does not mention (x*y)*z or x*(y*z) at all, and merely states (A ∧ B) ↔ (A ∧ B).

Step 3: Are the problems the same?
- No. The formal statement is a trivial self-implication not connected to concatenation or its definability. It fails to capture the intended equivalence between the definability of (x*y)*z and x*(y*z). It also uses `C(↑unitInterval, X)` rather than a `Path` structure and does not encode the concatenation operation.

Conclusion: The code is unfaithful to the natural language statement. It neither introduces nor uses concatenation, and proves only a tautology unrelated to the associativity-of-definedness claim.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's library, including the definition of `FreeGroup` and group homomorphisms.
- The comment states the universal property of the free group.
- `theorem free_group_lift_unique {S : Type _} {G : Type _} [Group G] (f : S → G) : ∃! (h : FreeGroup S →* G), h.toFun ∘ FreeGroup.of = f := by sorry`
  - For any types `S` and `G` with a group structure on `G`, and any function `f : S → G`.
  - There exists a unique morphism of groups (represented in Lean as a monoid homomorphism) `h : FreeGroup S →* G` such that `h ∘ FreeGroup.of = f` as functions `S → G`.
  - Here, `FreeGroup.of : S → FreeGroup S` is the canonical inclusion of generators into the free group, and `h.toFun` is the underlying function of the homomorphism `h`. The equation `h.toFun ∘ FreeGroup.of = f` means exactly that for each `s : S`, `h (FreeGroup.of s) = f s`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asserts the universal property of the free group: every set map `f : S → G` to a group `G` extends uniquely to a group homomorphism from the free group on `S` to `G` that agrees with `f` on generators. The phrase ""extending linearly to all words"" is informal for ""as a group homomorphism determined by values on generators"".
- The Lean statement precisely encodes this: existence and uniqueness of a homomorphism `h : FreeGroup S →* G` with `h ∘ of = f`.
- It uses standard Mathlib constructs (`FreeGroup`, `FreeGroup.of`, and `→*` for group/monoid homomorphisms). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; everything is canonical.

Final check:
- The two statements match exactly in mathematical meaning. The Lean theorem is a faithful formalization of the universal property of the free group.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib, but no specific manifold or smooth structure is declared.
- `variables {P : Type u} {Q : Type v}`: P and Q are arbitrary types; no manifold structures or topologies are provided.
- `variable (φ : P → Q)`: Introduces a function φ from P to Q, but without any structure.
- `variable (smooth_map : Prop) (same_dim : Prop)`: Introduces two arbitrary propositions, meant to stand for “φ is smooth” and “dim P = dim Q,” but they are completely uninterpreted and not linked to φ, P, or Q.
- `variable (is_local_diffeo : P → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate on points of P, intended to mean “φ is a local diffeomorphism near that point,” but it does not mention φ and carries no structure about neighborhoods or manifolds.
- `variable (is_dense : Set P → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate on subsets of P, presumably “dense,” but it’s not the Mathlib notion `Dense` and has no content.
- The theorem:
  `theorem smooth_map_same_dim_has_dense_local_diffeo_set (h_smooth : smooth_map) (h_dim : same_dim) : ∃ (S : Set P), is_dense S ∧ (∀ p : P, p ∈ S → is_local_diffeo p) := by sorry`
  This states: assuming the arbitrary propositions `smooth_map` and `same_dim`, there exists a subset S of P such that the arbitrary predicate `is_dense S` holds, and for all p ∈ S, the arbitrary predicate `is_local_diffeo p` holds. The proof is `sorry`.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- The original statement is about smooth manifolds P and Q with dim P = dim Q and a smooth map φ: P → Q. It asserts the existence of a dense set of points where φ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of each such point.
- The code does not declare manifold structures, smoothness structures, or dimensions from Mathlib. It replaces all key notions (smoothness, equal dimension, local diffeomorphism at a point, density) by arbitrary, uninterpreted placeholders (`Prop`, `P → Prop`, `Set P → Prop`). These are not tied to φ, nor to any structure on P or Q. Hence, the statement in Lean is entirely schematic and could assert anything depending on how those predicates are later instantiated; as written, it does not express the manifold/smooth/dimension/local diffeomorphism content.
- Moreover, φ is not used in the theorem statement except as a previously declared variable; `is_local_diffeo p` does not depend on φ. The notion of “neighborhood” is not encoded at all.
- Therefore, the code is not a legitimate, faithful translation.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Missing manifold and smooth structures on P and Q; no `[ChartedSpace]` or `SmoothManifoldWithCorners` apparatus.
- `smooth_map` and `same_dim` are arbitrary propositions, not Mathlib notions relating φ, P, and Q.
- `is_local_diffeo` is an arbitrary predicate on points of P, not the Mathlib statement that φ is a local diffeomorphism near p.
- `is_dense` is an arbitrary predicate on subsets, not Mathlib’s `Dense`.
- φ does not appear in the conclusion; the property at p is not tied to φ.
- The theorem body is `sorry` (permitted for translation audits, but irrelevant given the placeholders).
These discrepancies mean the Lean code does not faithfully formalize the given statement.

Given that, while the overall quantifier structure (exists dense S with property at each p ∈ S) resembles the natural language claim, the predicates are vacuous placeholders. If they were replaced by the correct Mathlib notions, the final theorem would be close to the intended statement, so this falls under “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed then the final theorem would be faithful.”

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib.
- `variable {X Y Γ : Type*}`: Introduces three arbitrary types X, Y, Γ with no structures.
- `def FreeAction : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate named ""FreeAction"" but defines it as True. This is a vacuous placeholder; it does not formalize a free group action nor refer to Γ or X.
- `def IsometricAction : Prop := True`: Another vacuous placeholder. It does not encode an action, a metric space on X, nor isometry properties.
- `def DiscreteOrbits : Prop := True`: Vacuous placeholder; does not describe any orbit structure or discreteness.
- `def IsQuotientMapForAction (q : X → Y) : Prop := True`: Vacuous placeholder purporting to state that q is the quotient map for the Γ-action on X, but with no action or quotient defined.
- `def LocallyIsometricCoveringMap (q : X → Y) : Prop := True`: Vacuous placeholder for the key conclusion; no topology or metric structure is involved.
- Theorem `quotient_map_of_free_isometric_discrete_orbits_is_locally_isometric_covering`: States that given a map q : X → Y and assumptions `IsometricAction`, `FreeAction`, `DiscreteOrbits`, `IsQuotientMapForAction q`, we have `LocallyIsometricCoveringMap q`. The proof is `sorry`. All assumptions and conclusion are the vacuous placeholders above, and no group structure, action, metric, or covering notions are actually present.

Step 2: Faithfulness of the whole translation
The natural language statement involves: a group Γ acting freely by isometries on a metric space X with discrete orbits, and the claim that the quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map. The code does not encode any of these structures: there is no group structure on Γ, no action Γ ⋯ X, no metric space on X, no quotient X/Γ, and no covering or local isometry notions. Instead, it replaces all key concepts by `True`. Hence the formal statement is vacuous and not a genuine translation.

Step 3: Comparison of the two statements
- Missing structures: group structure on Γ, action Γ × X → X, metric space on X, isometries, discrete orbits, topology/metric on Y.
- Target space: The statement refers to X/Γ; the code uses an arbitrary Y and a map q : X → Y, with a placeholder predicate asserting q is the quotient map. Even if that predicate were non-vacuous, the code does not define the quotient.
- Conclusion: ""locally isometric covering map"" is a placeholder with no content.
- Proof: Omitted (`sorry`).
Because all key notions are replaced with vacuous predicates, the translation is not faithful.

Grading rationale
The code makes up vacuous definitions for all essential predicates. If those were replaced by legitimate Mathlib definitions (group action by isometries with discrete orbits, actual quotient map X → X ⧸ Γ, and a proper notion of locally isometric covering), the theorem statement would align with the natural language claim. Hence this fits the rubric where vacuous placeholders are used but the intended structure of the theorem mirrors the original, warranting a grade around 6.

- Comment explains the mathematical setting and notes that assuming continuity of f is appropriate since, under the coinduced (quotient) topology on Y induced by f, f is continuous by definition.
- `theorem compact_space_of_surjective_compact_image {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]

  (hf_cont : Continuous f) : CompactSpace Y := by sorry`
  Natural language translation:
  Let X and Y be topological spaces, and f : X → Y a function that is surjective. Let K ⊆ X be a compact subset such that f(K) = Y. Assume f is continuous. Then Y is compact (in the sense that Y has a CompactSpace instance). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
Original statement: f : X → Y is surjective. There exists a compact subset K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Equip Y with the quotient (coinduced) topology induced by f. Prove that Y is compact.
- The Lean statement assumes continuity of f explicitly (`hf_cont`). Under the coinduced topology on Y induced by f, f is continuous by construction, so this matches the intended setting.
- It also assumes surjectivity (`hf_surj`), which is consistent with the natural statement (and in fact is already implied by `f '' K = univ`), so it is slightly redundant but harmless.
- The conclusion `CompactSpace Y` exactly states “Y is compact.”
- The code does not explicitly set the topology on Y to be coinduced, but by assuming continuity of f, it proves a slightly more general statement: for any topology on Y making f continuous and with a compact K whose image is all of Y, Y is compact. This generalization implies the original result when Y is endowed with the coinduced topology.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness and red flags.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no vacuous placeholders. The only `sorry` is in the proof, which is allowed since we are auditing the statement, not the proof.
- All Mathlib notions used (IsCompact, CompactSpace, Continuous, image, univ, surjective) are standard and appropriate.
- The statement is a faithful (indeed slightly stronger) formalization of the natural language claim once we note that the coinduced topology guarantees continuity of f.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the mathematical statement (slight generalization that still implies the original). Grade: 10.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are types equipped with topologies.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem compact_of_compact_image (f : X → Y) (hf : Continuous f) (K : Set X) (hK : IsCompact K) (himg : f '' K = (univ : Set Y)) : IsCompact (univ : Set Y)`
  translates to: Let f : X → Y be a continuous map. If there exists a compact subset K of X such that the image f(K) equals all of Y, then Y is compact (i.e., the whole space `univ : Set Y` is compact).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: “Suppose f : X → Y is a surjective map from a topological space X, and suppose there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Prove that Y is compact in the quotient topology.”
- The Lean theorem assumes: (i) X and Y are topological spaces; (ii) f is continuous; (iii) there exists compact K with f''K = univ. From (iii) we get surjectivity onto Y. The conclusion is Y is compact (`IsCompact univ`).
- The phrase “in the quotient topology” means: endow Y with the final/quotient topology induced by f, which ensures f is continuous. The Lean code does not explicitly define the quotient topology, but it assumes exactly the property ensured by the quotient topology (hf: Continuous f). Therefore, the Lean statement is a slight generalization: it proves compactness for any topology on Y that makes f continuous, and in particular applies to the quotient topology case.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is legitimate and uses standard Mathlib notions (Continuous, IsCompact, image equals univ).

Final check:
- Hypotheses match (existence of compact K with surjective image; continuity is appropriate for the quotient-topology reading).
- Conclusion matches (Y is compact). The absence of an explicit quotient topology construction is acceptable since the continuity assumption captures that setting and even strengthens the result.

Hence, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement (indeed, a standard generalization).

  This states (as a definable object) that for topological spaces X and Y with basepoints x0 and y0, there is a group isomorphism (Lean's `≃*`) between the fundamental group of the product space `(X × Y)` at basepoint `(x0, y0)` and the product of the fundamental groups `FundamentalGroup X x0 × FundamentalGroup Y y0`. The `by sorry` indicates the proof/construction is omitted, but the statement itself is precisely this isomorphism.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural language statement says: For topological spaces X and Y with basepoints x0 ∈ X and y0 ∈ Y, prove that π1(X×Y, (x0, y0)) ≅ π1(X, x0) × π1(Y, y0). This is exactly the same content as the Lean type: an isomorphism of groups between the fundamental group of the product and the product of fundamental groups at the specified basepoints.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Basepoints: Lean uses `(x0, y0)` as the basepoint in the product, matching the statement.
- Structure: `≃*` is precisely a multiplicative group isomorphism, matching the ≅ symbol.
- No extra assumptions (e.g., path-connectedness) are added or missing—they are not needed for this result in general.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; it directly states the theorem. The presence of `sorry` only omits the proof, which is acceptable for translation auditing focused on the statement.
There are no discrepancies. The Lean statement faithfully matches the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The code works in a general setting of smooth manifolds with corners over a nontrivially normed field 𝕜. It fixes model spaces E, E' (normed vector spaces over 𝕜), model types H, H' (with topologies), and model-with-corners structures I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H and I' : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H'.
- M and N are types with topologies and charted space structures ChartedSpace H M and ChartedSpace H' N. This encodes that M and N are manifolds modeled on H and H' respectively. Smoothness is expressed via ContMDiff I I' ⊤ for maps M → N.
- unit_interval is defined as the subtype { t : ℝ // 0 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ 1 }, which carries the induced topology from ℝ. This is the standard unit interval used for homotopies.
- The theorem continuous_map_homotopic_to_smooth states: given f : M → N with hf : Continuous f, there exists a map g : M → N such that g is smooth (ContMDiff I I' ⊤ g), and there exists a homotopy H : M × unit_interval → N that is continuous, with endpoint conditions H(x, 0) = f x and H(x, 1) = g x. Here 0 and 1 are inserted as elements of unit_interval using norm_num to discharge the bounds.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Let M and N be smooth manifolds and let f ∈ C^0(M,N). Show that f is homotopic to a smooth map M → N.”
- The Lean theorem assumes f is continuous (hf : Continuous f), asserts the existence of a smooth map g (ContMDiff I I' ⊤ g), and exhibits a continuous homotopy H from f to g over M × [0,1]. This matches the standard definition of homotopy in topology and expresses exactly that f is homotopic to a smooth map.
- The use of ModelWithCorners and ContMDiff expresses smoothness appropriately in Mathlib. The homotopy is given explicitly as a continuous map M × unit_interval → N with endpoint conditions.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; unit_interval is a legitimate subtype; ContMDiff is a standard Mathlib predicate; all structures are standard.
- Any mild generality (manifolds with corners, arbitrary 𝕜) is a benign generalization consistent with the statement “smooth manifolds,” and does not distort the meaning.
- Endpoint conditions and continuity are stated correctly; the presence of Continuous H ensures it is a genuine homotopy.
- Therefore, the code is a faithful formal statement of the natural language problem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and sets up universes u, v, w. It declares X, Y, Z as types equipped with topological spaces.
- It defines IsCovering (f : A → B) : Prop := True. This is explicitly a placeholder: it does not encode the actual definition of a covering map (existence of evenly covered neighborhoods, etc.). It is a vacuous predicate that holds for every function.
- The theorem covering_compose states: given f : X → Y and g : Y → Z, if IsCovering f and IsCovering g, then IsCovering (g ∘ f). The proof is omitted (by sorry), but since IsCovering is True, the statement is trivially true for any f and g.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The intended statement: If X → Y and Y → Z are covering maps (in the standard topological sense), then the composition X → Z is a covering map.
- The Lean code’s theorem has the right shape (assumes two covering maps and concludes the composition is a covering map), but the core predicate IsCovering is defined as True, not the genuine covering map notion. Hence the theorem is vacuous and does not faithfully represent the topological concept.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code replaces the actual definition of “covering map” with True, making the theorem trivial and not about covering maps at all. This is a vacuous auxiliary definition, violating the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be faithful and not placeholders. The proof is also a sorry, but the primary failure is the vacuous definition. If IsCovering were replaced by a faithful definition (e.g., the standard covering map condition), the statement would match the natural language one. As-is, it is not faithful.

Grade rationale: The only auxiliary definition is vacuous, but if it were fixed to a proper definition, the final theorem statement would match the intended claim. Hence, this fits the rubric for a 6.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {n : ℕ}` and modeling ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ`: We work in Euclidean space of dimension n by identifying ℝ^n with functions from `Fin n` to ℝ.
- `def polygonal_with_corners_on (S) (x y) : Prop := ∃ k verts, verts 0 = x ∧ verts (Fin.last k) = y ∧ ∀ i, i ≠ 0 ∧ i ≠ last → verts i ∈ S`:
  This says “there exist k and a sequence of k+1 points (vertices) from x to y such that every interior vertex lies in S.” There is no requirement that consecutive vertices are joined by straight line segments, no requirement that the path lies in ℝ^n \ S between corners, and no geometric path structure—just a list of points.
- `def shortest_path_exists (S) (x y) : Prop := ∃ (γ : Icc 0 1 → (Fin n → ℝ)), True`:
  This is a completely vacuous predicate: it always holds because there always exists some function γ, and the condition is `True`. It does not encode any notion of “shortest,” “path length,” or “avoiding S.”
- `theorem shortest_path_is_polygon ... (h : shortest_path_exists S x y) : polygonal_with_corners_on S x y := by sorry`:
  The statement claims: if such a (vacuous) `shortest_path_exists` holds, then there exists a “polygonal” configuration as defined above. No proof is provided (which is acceptable per instructions), but the statement itself is what we must audit.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: “Let S ⊂ ℝ^n. Prove that the shortest path from x to y in ℝ^n − S is a polygon with corners on S whenever this makes sense.” Key components:
- Paths lie in the complement ℝ^n \ S (except possibly at corners, depending on interpretation).
- A notion of path length and a shortest (i.e., geodesic) path.
- Conclusion: the shortest path itself is polygonal and has its corners on S.

Issues in the Lean code:
- The predicate `shortest_path_exists` is vacuous and does not encode shortestness, path length, or avoidance of S; it doesn’t even assert x,y ∈ ℝ^n \ S.
- The definition `polygonal_with_corners_on` only provides a list of vertices with interior ones in S; it does not encode straight segments, does not require that the edges lie in ℝ^n \ S, and does not even assert x,y ∉ S. It also does not indicate that this polygon is the shortest path—just that such a configuration exists.
- The theorem asserts existence of a polygonal configuration under the (vacuous) hypothesis, rather than asserting that the shortest path (in the complement) is polygonal. So the logical form is very different: it says “if a shortest path exists, there exists a polygon with corners on S,” not “the shortest path is such a polygon.”

Step 3: Final comparison.
The formal statement diverges substantially:
- “Shortest path” is not modeled at all (vacuous predicate).
- The complement ℝ^n \ S is never used in definitions or the conclusion.
- The conclusion is existential about some polygonal chain, not an identification of the shortest path as polygonal.
- The polygonal notion is too weak (no segment structure, no avoidance of S along edges).

Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation. It uses vacuous/placeholder definitions and changes the logical content of the theorem.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language and assess.
- Context: Γ is a group, X is a metric space, and there is a Γ-action on X (instance [MulAction Γ X]). This matches the setting of a group acting on a metric space.
- isometric_action: Defined as ∀ g : Γ, Isometry (fun x : X => g • x). This exactly formalizes “Γ acts on X by isometries.”
- covering_action: For every x ∈ X there exists an open set U with x ∈ U such that for all g ≠ 1, (g • U) ∩ U = ∅. Implemented as Set.image (λ y, g • y) U ∩ U = ∅. This is a standard formulation of a covering action: around each point, there is a neighborhood whose distinct translates are disjoint. Although only disjointness with U is explicitly required, for any g ≠ h, (gU) ∩ (hU) = ∅ follows because (gU) ∩ (hU) ≠ ∅ would imply (h⁻¹g)U ∩ U ≠ ∅ with h⁻¹g ≠ 1, contradicting the condition.
- free_action: ∀ g ≠ 1, ∀ x, g • x ≠ x. Standard definition of freeness.
- discrete_orbits: ∀ x, ∃ ε > 0, ∀ g, if g • x ≠ x then dist(g • x, x) ≥ ε. In a metric space this expresses that each orbit is a discrete subset: there is a positive radius around each orbit point containing no other orbit points. The guard “g • x ≠ x → …” allows for stabilizers; when combined with freeness, it reduces to the usual separation from all nontrivial translates. Moreover, since the theorem assumes isometries, the same separation propagates to every point in the orbit.
- Theorem covering_action_iff_free_and_discrete_orbits: With the hypothesis h_iso : isometric_action Γ X, it states covering_action Γ X ↔ (free_action Γ X ∧ discrete_orbits Γ X). This matches the intended equivalence.

All auxiliary definitions are genuine, not vacuous; they use standard Mathlib notions (Isometry, IsOpen, Set.image, metric dist) and no placeholders like True. The theorem is just a statement ending with sorry, as allowed by the instructions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: Suppose X is a metric space and Γ acts on X by isometries. Prove Γ acts on X as a covering action iff the action is free with discrete orbits.
- Lean theorem assumes exactly that (metric space structure on X and an action by isometries) and asserts the equivalence between a covering action and “free and discrete orbits.” The formal definitions of “covering action,” “free,” and “discrete orbits” are standard and faithful for metric spaces.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- Potential concern: Some definitions of covering action require pairwise disjointness of all distinct translates of U; the code’s condition only states gU ∩ U = ∅ for g ≠ 1. However, pairwise disjointness follows from the group property as explained. So no real discrepancy.
- Potential concern: Discrete orbits could be interpreted as each orbit is a discrete subset in the subspace topology. In a metric space, the provided ε-separation around each orbit point is exactly the usual characterization of discreteness (not requiring uniform discreteness across the orbit). The guard “g • x ≠ x” appropriately ignores stabilizer elements; freeness is handled separately in the conjunction.
- Continuity issues: Isometries ensure continuity/homeomorphism per group element, fitting the intended topological setting.

Conclusion: The Lean code provides legitimate, non-vacuous definitions that faithfully capture the notions in the natural language statement, and the theorem statement matches the equivalence precisely under the stated assumption of isometric action. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

- `def pi1_acts_on_fiber (X Y : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : X → Y) (y0 : Y) (is_covering : Prop) (Y_path_connected : Prop) (Y_locally_simply_connected : Prop) : Prop := by sorry`
  This defines a function that, given topological spaces X, Y, a map p : X → Y, a basepoint y0 : Y, and three hypothesis “flags” (just arbitrary Props) for “is_covering”, “Y_path_connected”, and “Y_locally_simply_connected”, returns a proposition. However, the proposition itself is not specified; it is filled with `by sorry`, which in Lean is a placeholder that allows the code to compile but leaves the actual content unspecified. Moreover, the hypotheses are not tied to Mathlib’s actual notions (Covering maps, path connectedness, local simple connectivity), and there is no reference to the fundamental group, the fiber, an action, or continuity within the formal statement. The docstring does not affect the formal content.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement asserts: given a covering map p : X → Y of a path connected and locally simply connected space Y, the fundamental group π1(Y, y0) acts on the fiber p^{-1}(y0) by [x][y] = [x*y], and this action is continuous.
- The Lean code does not formalize any of these notions. It neither defines nor references π1(Y, y0), the fiber p^{-1}(y0), an action, or continuity. It also does not use Mathlib’s standard definitions for covering maps or topological properties. The body is an unspecified proposition via `sorry`, making the definition vacuous. Thus, it is not a legitimate translation.

Step 3: Final check – are the two statements the same?
- They are different. The Lean code provides only a placeholder `Prop` with no content, depending on arbitrary `Prop`-valued parameters, and contains no mathematical structure reflecting the fundamental group action or continuity. The natural language statement is a specific and substantive theorem about group actions on fibers of covering maps. Therefore, the formal code is not a faithful translation.

Additional notes:
- Use of `by sorry` to define a `Prop` is especially problematic: it doesn’t even specify which proposition is meant, so it’s vacuous.
- The lack of Mathlib concepts (e.g., `Cover`, `FundamentalGroup`, `Fiber`, `Continuous`, `MulAction` or `TopologicalSpace` action structure) is a red flag per the guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the vacuity were fixed by explicitly stating the Mathlib-accurate proposition (existence of a continuous action of π1(Y,y0) on p^{-1}(y0) under the given hypotheses) using actual Mathlib definitions, then it could become faithful; as written, it is not.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- It imports Mathlib and announces that it is giving a placeholder formal statement.
- It defines a placeholder predicate `homotopy_rel` for homotopy of paths relative to a set S as `True`. Concretely: for any topological space `X`, basepoint `x : X`, loops `p q : Path x x`, and a set `S : Set X`, `homotopy_rel p q S` is always true. This is a vacuous definition.
- The theorem `loop_concat_reverse_contractible` states: for any topological space `X`, point `x0 : X`, and loop `p : Path x0 x0`, we have `homotopy_rel (Path.trans p (Path.refl x0)) (Path.refl x0) (Set.singleton x0)`. Here, `(Path.trans p (Path.refl x0))` is the concatenation of `p` with the constant path at `x0`, i.e., just `p`. The set used for “relative to” is `Set.singleton x0 ⊆ X`.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For a path `x : [0,1] → X`, let x̄(t)=x(1−t) be the reverse. Then `x * x̄` is homotopic relative to `{0,1}` (in the domain [0,1]) to the constant loop at `x(0)`.
- Mismatches:
  - The code’s `homotopy_rel` is a placeholder set to `True`, so it does not capture any actual homotopy notion. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be faithful, not vacuous.
  - The theorem uses `(Path.trans p (Path.refl x0))`, i.e., `p * id`, instead of `p * p.symm`. It asserts any loop `p` is homotopic to the constant loop (relative to something), which is generally false and not the desired statement. The correct object should be `Path.trans p p.symm`.
  - The “relative to” set is given as `Set.singleton x0 ⊆ X`, whereas the natural statement refers to fixing the endpoints `{0,1}` in the domain interval. In Mathlib, path homotopy relative refers to endpoints in the parameter, not a subset of `X`.
  - The natural language starts with an arbitrary path `x : [0,1] → X` (not necessarily a loop), considers `x * x̄` (which is a loop at `x(0)`), and shows this loop is homotopic relative to `{0,1}` to the constant loop. The code starts with a loop `p : Path x0 x0` and does not form the reverse.

3) Final check: The math problems differ in multiple essential ways: the key operation (concatenation with reverse vs with constant), the homotopy notion (placeholder True vs actual path homotopy relative endpoints), and the set used for “relative to” (subset of X vs endpoints in [0,1]). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Given these issues, even if the placeholder were replaced by a correct definition, the theorem statement itself would remain incorrect (since it uses `p * refl` and the wrong relative set). Hence it fails the faithfulness test.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The first declaration `closed_injective_homeomorph_range` takes topological spaces X and Y and a map f : X → Y with the hypotheses: (i) f is continuous (`Continuous f`), (ii) f is a closed map (`IsClosedMap f`), and (iii) f is injective (`Function.Injective f`). The conclusion is a term of type `Homeomorph X (Subtype (range f))`, i.e., a homeomorphism between X and the image of f equipped with the subspace topology. This expresses precisely: a continuous, closed, injective map is a homeomorphism onto its image.
- The second declaration `proper_injective_homeomorph_range` assumes Y is a locally compact Hausdorff space (`[LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`), and takes a map f : X → Y with (i) continuity, (ii) properness (`IsProperMap f`), and (iii) injectivity. It concludes again with a `Homeomorph X (Subtype (range f))`, i.e., f is a homeomorphism onto its image under those assumptions.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement has two parts: (A) “any closed injection f : X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image” and (B) “in particular, any proper injection f : X → Y is a homeomorphism onto its image,” under the standing assumption that Y is locally compact Hausdorff.
- For (A): The Lean code’s first statement matches the standard precise formulation: one needs f to be continuous, injective, and a closed map; then f is a homeomorphism onto its image. The code states exactly this. It does not assume Y is locally compact Hausdorff, which is fine (it’s a generalization, since the result doesn’t need that assumption).
- For (B): The second statement adds the hypotheses that Y is locally compact Hausdorff and that f is proper and injective (and also assumes continuity explicitly). This matches the “in particular” clause: in an LCH Hausdorff target, a proper injective map is a homeomorphism onto its image. In many conventions, “proper map” already includes continuity; even if Mathlib’s `IsProperMap` already entails continuity, the extra `Continuous f` hypothesis is harmless. Either way, this faithfully captures the intended “in particular” result.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- The only potential nuance is that the natural language phrase “closed injection” does not explicitly mention continuity, whereas the Lean statement requires `Continuous f`. In standard topology contexts, maps under discussion are typically assumed continuous; moreover, the result would be false without continuity. Thus the Lean formulation is the correct precise version of the intended statement.
- The first Lean statement is actually stronger than the natural language one insofar as it does not require Y to be locally compact Hausdorff; that is an acceptable and faithful generalization.
- No vacuous or placeholder auxiliary definitions are introduced; all concepts (`IsClosedMap`, `IsProperMap`, `Homeomorph`, `range`) are standard Mathlib notions. The use of `sorry` only omits proofs, which is allowed for this translation audit.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statement, with a slight generalization and the necessary explicit continuity assumption.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The code sets up topological spaces X, Xtil, and I.
- It states a theorem `deck_transformation_preserves_lift` with hypotheses:
  - p : Xtil → X, f : Xtil → Xtil,
  - hf : p ∘ f = p,
  - γ : I → X with hγ : Continuous γ,
  - γ_tilde : I → Xtil with hγ_tilde : Continuous γ_tilde,
  - h_lift : p ∘ γ_tilde = γ.
- The conclusion: p ∘ (f ∘ γ_tilde) = γ.
- No assumptions about f being continuous or a homeomorphism, no mention of covering maps, path-connectedness, or local simple connectivity. I is an arbitrary topological space (not necessarily the unit interval).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: Let X be path connected and locally simply connected. Let p : X̃ → X be a covering map. Let f : X̃ ≃ₜ X̃ be a deck transformation (a homeomorphism with p ∘ f = p). Then for any path γ : I → X and any lift γ̃ : I → X̃ (i.e., continuous with p ∘ γ̃ = γ), the map f ∘ γ̃ is also a lift of the same path γ.
- Mathematically, to be a “lift of a path” one needs both: (i) p ∘ (f ∘ γ̃) = γ and (ii) f ∘ γ̃ is continuous. The latter follows in the usual setting because f is a homeomorphism and γ̃ is continuous.
- The Lean code only proves the algebraic equality p ∘ (f ∘ γ_tilde) = γ from hf and h_lift. It does not assume f is continuous/homeomorphism, nor does it conclude continuity of f ∘ γ_tilde. Thus it does not fully capture the notion “is a lift” in the topological sense.
- The code also omits the covering map hypothesis and the path-connected/locally simply connected assumptions on X. These are not needed for the specific algebraic identity, but the omission of f’s continuity/homeomorphism matters for the claim that the composite is a lift (as a continuous path).
- The domain I is arbitrary; this is a reasonable generalization of “path” provided continuity is maintained, but again continuity of f ∘ γ̃ is not ensured.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Same core idea: If p ∘ f = p and γ̃ is a lift of γ, then f ∘ γ̃ maps under p to γ.
- Differences:
  - The code does not encode that f is a homeomorphism (or even continuous), so it cannot conclude that f ∘ γ_tilde is continuous. Therefore it does not establish that f ∘ γ_tilde is a lift in the topological sense.
  - No covering map, path-connected, or locally simply connected assumptions are present. These are not essential to the algebraic identity but are part of the original context.
- Hence, the code captures only the algebraic part of the statement, not the full topological claim that the composite is a continuous lift.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful because it omits continuity of the composite (and the homeomorphism condition on f), which is essential to calling it a “lift of a path.” However, it is very close in spirit and correctly formalizes the key equality.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `universe u v w`: Setup of the Lean environment and universe levels.
- `def fiber {X : Type u} {Y : Type v} (f : X → Y) (y : Y) : Type u := { x : X // f x = y }`:
  Defines the set-theoretic fiber of a function f over y as a subtype. This is a legitimate and standard definition.
- `def is_covering_map ... : Prop := True`:
  Declares a placeholder predicate for “covering map” which is always true. This is vacuous and does not reflect the actual notion of a covering map. Red flag.
- `def covering_sheets_const_along_path ... (γ : I → Y) (t0 t1 : I) : (fiber (f := f) (γ t0)) ≃ (fiber (f := f) (γ t1)) := by sorry`:
  Claims to produce a bijection between the fibers over γ t0 and γ t1 for any function γ from an arbitrary type I to Y, assuming only the vacuous `is_covering_map`. There is no topological structure, no continuity, no notion of a path (as in a continuous map from an interval), and the proof is omitted via `sorry`. This is far from the intended statement involving paths in a topological space and evenly covered open sets. Also, it replaces “number of sheets constant” with the stronger statement “fibers are in bijection,” and completely omits evenly covered open sets.
- `def covering_sheets_const_on_path_connected ... (hpath : ∀ y0 y1 : Y, ∃ (I' : Type w) (γ' : I' → Y) (t0 t1 : I'), γ' t0 = y0 ∧ γ' t1 = y1) ... : (fiber ... y0) ≃ (fiber ... y1) := by sorry`:
  States that if Y is “path connected” then all fibers are in bijection. But here “path connected” is replaced by an extremely weak and essentially trivial condition: for any y0, y1 there exists some type I' and function γ' hitting both points (this is always true, e.g., take I' = Y and γ' = id). Again no topology, no continuity, no genuine path notion. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The original statement is about topological spaces, covering maps, evenly covered open sets, and the constancy of the number of sheets along any path in Y, with the conclusion that if Y is path connected then the covering map is n-to-1 (with possibly infinite n).
- The code does not introduce or use any topological structure (`TopologicalSpace`), never defines “evenly covered,” and uses a vacuous `is_covering_map := True`.
- The notion of path is replaced by an arbitrary function from an arbitrary type, which does not capture continuous paths.
- “Path connectedness” is replaced by a trivial condition that holds in any type.
- The result is framed as existence of an equivalence (bijection) between fibers, which is a plausible rephrasing of “constant number of sheets” in the covering map context, but given the vacuous assumptions it is not faithful to the original theorem's hypotheses or meaning.

Final assessment:
- Multiple vacuous placeholders (is_covering_map, fake path connectedness), absence of topology, and omission of “evenly covered” render this not faithful.
- Even if the placeholders were replaced by real notions, the direction of expressing constancy via fiber bijections is a reasonable formalization of the “in particular” part, but the current code does not legitimately encode the intended concepts.

Therefore, the translation fails. Grade reflects that while there is a non-vacuous definition of fiber and an intended direction toward bijections of fibers (a standard consequence for covering maps), the key predicates are vacuous and the path notions are incorrect.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib: Brings in Mathlib, but nothing specific about coverings is used.
- universe u v w: Universe parameters for types.
- constant universal_covering_map ... : (X → Y) → Prop: Introduces a predicate “universal_covering_map” as an axiom (a bare constant) for any map between topological spaces. This is a placeholder; it has no connection to Mathlib’s notions of covering maps or universal covers.

(f : X → Z), q ∘ f = p := by sorry: States that if p : X → Y and q : Z → Y are universal covering maps (in the sense of the placeholder predicate), then there exists a unique f : X → Z with q ∘ f = p. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Natural language: “Suppose that X → Y and Z → Y are universal covering maps. Prove that X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y, i.e. there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle X → Y and Z → Y commute.”
- Content match: The theorem in Lean asserts existence and uniqueness of a map f : X → Z such that q ∘ f = p, which matches the “i.e.” part verbatim.
- However, the natural language also says “X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y”. In standard mathematics, this means there is a homeomorphism h : X ≃ₜ Z over Y (a covering isomorphism). The Lean statement does not assert that f is a homeomorphism or a covering isomorphism; it only asserts existence of a unique commuting map. So it does not capture the “isomorphic as a covering” part, unless one takes the (mathematically dubious) identification “isomorphic” ≡ “there is a unique commuting map”. The code does not ensure bijectivity/homeomorphism.
- Moreover, uniqueness of the lift without basepoints is generally false; different lifts can exist and differ by a deck transformation. In the universal cover case, existence is OK and one gets an isomorphism, but uniqueness requires a basepoint choice. The statement’s claim of uniqueness is stronger than the usual result and, strictly speaking, not correct without basepoint data. The code mirrors this potentially incorrect uniqueness claim, but still does not assert isomorphism.

Step 3: Check for red flags and placeholders.
- The key predicate universal_covering_map is an axiom/placeholder (constant) and not Mathlib’s definition. This violates the guideline against vacuous/placeholder definitions. It makes the theorem essentially unfounded in Mathlib.
- No other auxiliary definitions are present; the theorem is stated with a sorry proof, which is acceptable for translation, but the core predicate is non-legitimate.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. The code uses a vacuous placeholder for “universal covering map” and does not formalize “isomorphic as a covering” (homeomorphism over Y). It only states existence/uniqueness of a commuting map. Even if the placeholder were replaced by the proper Mathlib definition, the theorem would still underspecify the isomorphism aspect and overclaim uniqueness without basepoints. Hence it fails the faithfulness test.

- The provided Lean code does not address (a) at all: there is no mention of homotopy, no relative {0,1}, and no concatenation operation on paths. It also uses `C(unitInterval, X)` (continuous maps) rather than Mathlib's `Path X` structure, so the notion of concatenation is not even available.
- For (b), the theorem should formalize that the condition for (x*y)*z to exist is equivalent to the condition for x*(y*z) to exist; in Mathlib terms, this would be about equality of endpoints ensuring the concatenations are defined. Instead, the code merely states `(x(1)=y(0) ∧ y(1)=z(0)) ↔ (x(1)=y(0) ∧ y(1)=z(0))`, which is tautological and does not mention concatenations at all. It neither defines nor references the definedness of (x*y)*z or x*(y*z).
- The docstring suggests the intended meaning, but the actual theorem statement does not encode it.
- Additionally, the proof is `by sorry`, which suggests incompleteness; though compilation settings might allow sorry, it underscores that no actual content is provided.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The original asks for associativity up to homotopy rel endpoints and equivalence of definedness of the concatenations. The code presents a tautology about endpoint equalities for continuous maps and omits both the homotopy statement and the relation to concatenation definedness. It also uses `C(unitInterval, X)` instead of proper paths.
- Differences:
  - Missing homotopy statement (rel {0,1}) entirely.
  - No use of concatenation operations; no statement about definedness of (x*y)*z vs x*(y*z).
  - Uses continuous maps instead of `Path`, so the concept of concatenation is not captured.
  - The theorem is a trivial A ↔ A, not the intended equivalence of definedness conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library, including topology and linear algebra.
- The theorem is named `invertible_matrix_with_pos_and_neg_eigen_is_covering_map` and is parameterized by a natural number `n`.
- `(A : (Fin n → ℝ) ≃ₗ[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ))`: `A` is a linear equivalence (i.e., an invertible linear map) on `ℝ^n`, here modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`. This matches an invertible matrix on `ℝ^n`.
- `(lam mu : ℝ) (v w : Fin n → ℝ)`: Real numbers `lam` and `mu` (putative eigenvalues) and vectors `v`, `w` (putative eigenvectors).
- `(hv : v ≠ 0) (hw : w ≠ 0)`: The vectors are nonzero, i.e., true eigenvectors.
- `(hA_v : (A.toLinearMap : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)) v = lam • v)`: `v` is an eigenvector of `A` with eigenvalue `lam`.
- `(hA_w : (A.toLinearMap : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)) w = mu • w)`: `w` is an eigenvector of `A` with eigenvalue `mu`.
- `(hlam : lam > 1) (hmu : mu < -1)`: The eigenvalues satisfy `lam > 1` and `mu < -1`.
- Conclusion: `IsCoveringMap (A.toLinearMap : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ))`: The underlying function of `A` (as a map on `ℝ^n`) is a covering map.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Take an invertible matrix A with at least one eigenvalue > 1 and at least one eigenvalue < -1. Prove that A : ℝ^n → ℝ^n is a covering map.""
- The Lean statement precisely models an invertible linear map on `ℝ^n` (as a linear equivalence), and explicitly assumes the existence of nonzero eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues `lam > 1` and `mu < -1`. This is an explicit formalization of “at least one eigenvalue > 1 and at least one < −1.”
- Representing `ℝ^n` by `(Fin n → ℝ)` is standard in mathlib and is faithful to ℝ^n.
- The conclusion uses `IsCoveringMap` on the underlying function `A.toLinearMap`, which matches “A is a covering map.”
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; all symbols come from Mathlib. The proof is `sorry`, which is allowed per the instructions.
- The assumptions are slightly stronger syntactically (they include explicit eigenvectors), but mathematically equivalent to having those real eigenvalues. This is an acceptable and faithful formalization.

Final check: The math problems are the same. Both assert that an invertible linear map on ℝ^n with one eigenvalue > 1 and one < −1 is a covering map. No mismatch in meaning or scope; no red flags.

",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code
- The theorem is named `final_T2_iff_closed_relation`.
- It takes types `X, Y`, a topology `tX : TopologicalSpace X`, and a function `P : X → Y`.
- It considers on `Y` the coinduced (final) topology `TopologicalSpace.coinduced P tX`, i.e., the coarsest topology on `Y` making `P` continuous.
- The statement: `@T2Space Y (TopologicalSpace.coinduced P tX) ↔ IsClosed (setOf fun p : X × X => P p.1 = P p.2 : Set (X × X))`.
  In words: “Y is Hausdorff under the coinduced topology from P if and only if the subset of X × X consisting of pairs (x₁,x₂) with P x₁ = P x₂ is closed (in the product topology of X).”
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing the statement’s faithfulness.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: “Suppose a topology on Y is the final topology from functions fᵢ : Xᵢ → Y (i ∈ I). Prove that Y is Hausdorff iff there exists a topological space X and a function P : X → Y which includes all fᵢ (i.e., factors their data into a single map, typically the coproduct map) and P is injective.”

- The mathematical content of the Lean theorem: Y Hausdorff (with final topology via a single P) ↔ the equivalence relation R = {(x₁,x₂) | P x₁ = P x₂} is closed in X × X. This is a “closed equivalence relation” criterion.
- The mathematical content of the natural statement: Y Hausdorff (with final topology from a family {fᵢ}) ↔ there exists a space X and a map P : X → Y encompassing all fᵢ such that P is injective. That is an injectivity criterion on the global source (e.g., disjoint union Σᵢ Xᵢ → Y). 

These are different:
- The Lean statement uses “closedness of the kernel relation” on X × X for a fixed P.
- The natural statement asserts the existence of a global P (including all fᵢ) that is injective. Injectivity is a much stronger condition than closedness of the kernel relation, and generally unrelated without extra hypotheses (e.g., compactness, closed maps, etc.).
- The quantification also differs: the natural statement is existential over X and P (built to include all fᵢ), while the Lean statement is for an arbitrary fixed P.
- The natural statement starts with a family {fᵢ : Xᵢ → Y}; the Lean statement speaks only about a single map P : X → Y and does not mention the family or its universal inclusion property.

Step 3: Final check
The two statements are not the same problem:
- Code: T2 ↔ closed kernel relation for a fixed P and coinduced topology.
- Natural: T2 ↔ existence of an injective P incorporating the given family.
They differ on both the criterion (closed relation vs injectivity) and the quantification (for arbitrary P vs exists P including all fᵢ). Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {Y : Type u} [TopologicalSpace Y]`: Fixes a topological space Y.
- `constant BasedCovering : ∀ (X : Type u) (x0 : X), Prop`: Introduces an uninterpreted predicate ""BasedCovering X x0"" with no mention of a map to Y or a basepoint y0 in Y. It does not encode a covering map (X, x0) → (Y, y0).
- `constant UniversalCover : ∀ (X : Type u) (x0 : X), Prop`: Another uninterpreted predicate ""UniversalCover X x0"" that again does not refer to Y or a covering map; it cannot express that a map (X, x0) → (Y, y0) is universal.
- `constant CoveringMorphism : ∀ (X : Type u) (x0 : X) (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z), Type u`: An uninterpreted type of morphisms between (X, x0) and (Z, z0) with no relation to Y or to covering maps over Y. This does not ensure morphisms are maps over Y or respect basepoints over y0.
- `constant Y_is_Hausdorff : Prop` and `constant Y_has_universal_covering : Prop`: Uninterpreted global propositions; they are not tied to the specific Y declared above (no parameters) and do not use standard Mathlib notions.
- The theorem `universal_covering_iff_lifting_property` states: assuming `Y_is_Hausdorff` and `Y_has_universal_covering`, for any X and x0, if `BasedCovering X x0` then `UniversalCover X x0 ↔ ∀ Z z0, BasedCovering Z z0 → ∃! (f : CoveringMorphism X x0 Z z0), True`.
  - The right-hand side asserts: for every based covering (Z, z0), there exists exactly one f in the type `CoveringMorphism X x0 Z z0`. The predicate in the uniqueness quantifier is `True`, so it’s asserting absolute uniqueness of an f of that type, not uniqueness under a commuting condition over Y.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original statement fixes a based covering map (X, x0) → (Y, y0) and characterizes universality in terms of unique morphisms to any other based covering (Z, z0) → (Y, y0). Key features:
  - The data of the covering maps to Y (including the basepoint y0) must be present.
  - Morphisms are over Y and respect basepoints.
- The Lean code omits crucial structure:
  - `BasedCovering` and `UniversalCover` do not mention Y, y0, or any map to Y. They are properties of (X, x0) alone.
  - `CoveringMorphism` is not constrained to be a morphism over Y; it is just an arbitrary type depending on X, x0, Z, z0.
  - There is no variable y0 : Y anywhere; the category of based coverings over (Y, y0) is not represented.
  - The uniqueness statement uses `∃! f, True`, which expresses uniqueness of an f in a hom-set that is not linked to Y, rather than uniqueness of a commuting triangle over Y.
  - `Y_is_Hausdorff` and `Y_has_universal_covering` are opaque placeholders and not tied to the fixed Y; they are also unused in any meaningful way in the statement.

Final comparison:
- The code does not faithfully formalize the natural language theorem. It replaces all essential notions with uninterpreted placeholders lacking the target space, basepoint, and covering maps to Y. The uniqueness condition is also expressed in a vacuous way. Hence the two problems are materially different.

Grade rationale:
- There is a recognizable attempt at the universal property pattern (an iff with a unique morphism to any other covering), but the absence of Y, y0, and the maps makes the formalization unfaithful. The auxiliary definitions are placeholders and do not encode the intended Mathlib concepts. If those were properly defined and parameterized by Y and y0 (and morphisms were over Y), the shape of the theorem could match the intended statement. This merits a mid-range score per the rubric.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {Γ : Type _} [Group Γ]`: We have a group Γ.
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X]`: We have a metric space X.
- `variable [MulAction Γ X]`: Γ acts on X by a (left) action `•`.
- Hypothesis `h_isom : ∀ γ : Γ, Isometry (fun x => γ • x)`: Each group element acts by an isometry on X.
- The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two conditions:
  Left side (LHS): For every x y ∈ X, there exist open sets U, V ⊆ X such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, U and V are disjoint, and both U and V are Γ-invariant. The invariance is encoded as `∀ γ u, u ∈ U ↔ γ • u ∈ U` (and similarly for V), which is equivalent to `γ • U = U` for all γ ∈ Γ because the action maps are bijections.
  Right side (RHS): For every x ∈ X, there exists ε > 0 such that for all nontrivial γ ≠ 1 and all y ∈ ball(x, ε), we have γ • y ∉ ball(x, ε). In words: a sufficiently small ball around each point is disjoint from all its nontrivial Γ-translates.
- The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but our task is to audit the statement, not provide/prove it.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language condition in focus is: ""Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets."" The Lean LHS expresses exactly this: ∀ x y, ∃ disjoint open U,V with x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and both U,V Γ-invariant.
- The theorem phrases an equivalence between that condition and a specific other condition (small disjoint balls under nontrivial translates) under the assumption the action is by isometries, which matches the setup in the natural language.

3) Comparing the whole translation to the original statement:
- The original phrasing ""is equivalent to the others"" suggests this condition is one among several equivalent conditions; the Lean code provides an explicit equivalence with one such condition (the small-ball non-overlap criterion). This is a natural and standard ""other"" condition in the context of actions by isometries (often characterizing proper discontinuity or a discrete action), so it is a faithful instantiation of ""equivalent to the others.""
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; all concepts are standard Mathlib notions. The invariance predicate is expressed in a logically equivalent but slightly stronger-looking form (iff instead of inclusion), which is appropriate given group actions are bijective.
- Minor note: The original text was somewhat meta (referring to a list of equivalents), while the Lean code picks one explicit equivalence; this is a slight specialization but remains faithful to demonstrating that the stated condition is equivalent to another standard condition.

Conclusion: The code faithfully formalizes the condition from the natural language statement and asserts its equivalence to a precise metric/isometry condition. No red flags or vacuous definitions. Slight specialization is acceptable.

- `variable (f0 f1 : X → Y)`: Two functions f0 and f1 from X to Y (no continuity assumed here).
- `variable (Homotopic : (X → Y) → (X → Y) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary binary predicate on functions, named Homotopic; it is not tied to Mathlib's definition of homotopy, nor does it encode continuity.

This is not tied to Mathlib’s induced map on π1, nor guaranteed to be a group homomorphism, nor dependent on basepoint conditions.
- The theorem:

  This asserts that if f0 and f1 satisfy the abstract predicate Homotopic and both send x0 to y0, then the two arbitrarily-assigned functions map_on_pi1 f0 and map_on_pi1 f1 are equal. The proof is omitted.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If f_t is a homotopy of continuous maps X → Y with f0(x0) = f1(x0) = y0, then the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups agree: (f0)_* = (f1)_* : π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, y0).
- Discrepancies:
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s notion of homotopy (e.g. `ContinuousMap`, `Homotopic` in Mathlib) or continuity at all; it uses an arbitrary predicate `Homotopic` with no connection to continuity or genuine homotopy.
  - The induced map on π1 is replaced by an arbitrary function `map_on_pi1` from functions X → Y to functions between fundamental groups. It is not tied to the topological functorial construction nor required to be a group homomorphism.
  - The theorem’s conclusion compares these arbitrary functions rather than the genuine induced homomorphisms.
  - While it does include assumptions `hf0` and `hf1` that f0 and f1 send x0 to y0, these are not used to define `map_on_pi1` (which ignores these equalities) and thus do not ensure that `map_on_pi1 f` represents the correct induced map.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code formalizes a statement about an arbitrary predicate `Homotopic` and an arbitrary assignment `map_on_pi1`, not the standard notions from algebraic topology. The key mathematical content—that homotopic (continuous) maps induce the same homomorphism on π1—is not captured, because the code abstracts away the real definitions and properties. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes per guidelines:
- The code does not use Mathlib’s existing definitions for homotopy or the induced map on fundamental groups, which is a red flag.
- There are no vacuous definitions like `:= True`, but the placeholders are arbitrary (uninterpreted) and hence do not faithfully represent the intended mathematical concepts.
- If `Homotopic` were replaced by Mathlib’s homotopy of continuous maps, and `map_on_pi1` by the actual induced homomorphism (properly defined using basepoints), the theorem statement would be faithful. In its current form, it is not.

- The natural statement requires: Z is a domain (open and connected), g: Z → ℂ is complex analytic, and a logarithm G is a complex analytic function with g = e^G. It asserts the equivalence with: (1) g(z) ≠ 0 for all z, and (2) g takes every loop in Z to a null-homotopic loop in ℂ \ {0}.

Discrepancies:
- Analyticity is missing entirely in the Lean code. Neither g nor G is required to be analytic. This is a core part of the original statement and its definition of “logarithm.”
- The loop condition is replaced by a vacuous placeholder `maps_loops_to_nullhomotopic := True`, rendering condition (2) meaningless in the code. This is a serious deviation.
- Although U is assumed open and connected (matching “domain”), the key analytic hypotheses and the precise topological mapping condition are not encoded.
- The theorem is stated with `sorry` (no proof), but our task focuses on translation correctness; the larger issue is that the core predicates are not faithfully defined.

Final check: The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It replaces the crucial topological condition by True and omits analyticity from both the hypothesis on g and the definition of a logarithm. Thus the formal and natural statements are materially different.

Grade justification: Because of vacuous definitions and missing analytic requirements, even fixing only the vacuous loop predicate would still leave the theorem non-faithful. Multiple essential aspects are absent. This aligns with a low score according to the rubric.

",4,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The file works with arbitrary topological spaces X, Y, Z.
- incl_snd: This defines the “inclusion” map C(Y, Z) → C(X × Y, Z) by precomposing with the second projection Prod.snd. Concretely, incl_snd g = g ∘ Prod.snd, which maps (x, y) ↦ g y. This matches the intended inclusion.
- incl_snd_equiv_dense (A : Set X) (hA : Dense A) : (ContinuousMap Y Z) ≃ { f : ContinuousMap (X × Y) Z // ∀ x ∈ A, ∀ y1 y2 : Y, f (x, y1) = f (x, y2) } := by sorry. This states an equivalence between all continuous maps Y → Z and the subtype of continuous maps on X × Y that are constant along each fiber {x} × Y for x in A. The proof is omitted with sorry.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Given X, Y topological spaces and A ⊆ X dense, the inclusion C(Y) → C(X × Y) is an isomorphism onto the functions that are constant on each set {x} × Y with x ∈ X (i.e., for all x in X). Typically C(·) denotes continuous functions into ℝ or ℂ; the target is the subspace of fiberwise-constant functions for all x.
- The Lean code generalizes the codomain to an arbitrary topological space Z, which is a standard acceptable generalization, provided the result remains true. However, the code only characterizes the image as those f that are fiberwise constant for x ∈ A (the dense subset), not for all x ∈ X. The comment claims “(and therefore for all x ∈ X)”, but the formal statement as a type only imposes the property on A. So the stated equivalence is weaker than the natural language target.
- Moreover, the definition is given “:= by sorry”, i.e., it postulates an equivalence without constructing it. Per the auditing guidelines, a definition filled with sorry is a red flag and counts as a failure for faithfulness.
- There is also a subtle topological issue: extending equality from a dense set A to all of X for continuous maps into Z usually requires a separation condition on Z (e.g., T2/Hausdorff) to ensure uniqueness of limits. The Lean statement imposes no such condition and so avoids asserting fiberwise constancy for all x, which is precisely where separation would be needed; this further diverges from the original statement which asserts constancy for all x ∈ X.

3) Final comparison:
- The code’s forward map incl_snd matches the intended inclusion.
- The equivalence target in Lean is only fiberwise-constant over A, not over all of X, and the construction is left as sorry. Therefore the Lean statement is not a faithful formalization of the original claim.
- The generalization to arbitrary Z would be fine if the rest matched, but here it doesn’t.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to (i) only requiring constancy on A rather than all X, and (ii) using sorry for the core equivalence.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language
- `constant CoveringAction : Prop` introduces a bare proposition named CoveringAction with no parameters. It does not specify an action of Γ on Y nor any covering property; it is a vacuous placeholder.
- `constant IsSimplyConnected : Prop`, `IsLocallySimplyConnected : Prop`, `IsHausdorff : Prop` are also parameter-free propositions, not tied to Y or any space. They do not encode that Y is simply connected, locally simply connected, or Hausdorff.
- `constant IsUniversalCoveringMap : Prop` is a parameter-free proposition, not tied to any map p. It does not state that a particular p is a universal covering map.
- `constant fundamental_group (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z) : Type u` declares a function symbol but is unused; it also shadows mathlib’s actual fundamental group and gives no group structure.
- `constant GroupIso : Prop` is a parameter-free proposition that does not specify which groups are isomorphic; it does not say π1(X) ≅ Γ.
- The theorem `benmckay_top_covering_spaces_731` takes as inputs a map `p : Y → X`, an action `act : Γ → Y → Y`, and proofs of the above parameter-free propositions, plus a basepoint `x0 : X`. It concludes `IsUniversalCoveringMap ∧ GroupIso`. Since the propositions are unparameterized, the hypotheses do not actually refer to Γ, Y, X, p, or the action in any meaningful way, and the conclusion does not assert that p is a universal covering map nor that π1(X) ≅ Γ.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful
- The natural language statement is: If Γ acts by covering transformations on a simply connected, locally simply connected Hausdorff space Y, then the quotient map p: Y → X := Γ\Y is a universal covering map, and π1(X) ≅ Γ.
- The Lean code does not encode: (a) that the action is a covering action of Γ on Y; (b) that X is the quotient Γ\Y and that p is the quotient map; (c) that Y is simply connected, locally simply connected, Hausdorff; (d) that the conclusion is specifically “p is a universal covering map”; (e) that the asserted group isomorphism is between π1(X) (based at some x0) and Γ. All relevant notions are replaced by unparameterized placeholder Props; the theorem’s conclusion is a conjunction of two unrelated placeholder Props.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation: it uses vacuous, unindexed constants and does not tie them to the data in the statement.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
- Different. The original statement is precise about the objects and the conclusion (universal covering map of the quotient map, and a specific isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ). The Lean theorem neither mentions quotient construction nor specifies the map p in the conclusion, and the group isomorphism target/source are unspecified. Auxiliary definitions are vacuous. Even if one were to try to swap in real definitions, the current statement lacks the necessary parameters to express the specific isomorphism and the universal covering nature of p.

Additional red flags per guidelines
- All auxiliary definitions are vacuous placeholders (parameter-free Props), failing guideline 3.
- The theorem does not use the basepoint x0 nor the fundamental group in its conclusion; GroupIso is unparameterized.
- Standard mathlib notions (T2Space for Hausdorff, SimplyConnectedSpace, LocallySimplyConnectedSpace, quotient by group action, CoveringMap/UniversalCover) are not used.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]`: We have a type X equipped with a metric space structure.
- `variable {Γ : Type*} [Group Γ] [MulAction Γ X]`: A group Γ acting on X.
- `def orbit_rel (x y : X) : Prop := ∃ g : Γ, g • x = y`: Defines the orbit relation: y is in the orbit of x if there exists g with g • x = y. For a group action, this relation is in fact an equivalence relation, but the code does not declare it as a Setoid or use it later.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem quotient_metric_topology_agrees (hIsometry : ∀ (g : Γ) (x y : X), dist (g • x) (g • y) = dist x y) : ∃ (R : Setoid X) (inst : MetricSpace (Quotient R)), True := by sorry`
  Natural language: Assuming the action is by isometries (distance is preserved by each g), there exists some equivalence relation R on X and some metric space structure on the quotient Quotient R, and (trivially) True.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is about the specific quotient by the group action (the orbit equivalence), with the specific “infimum metric” d(\bar{x}, \bar{y}) = inf_{g in Γ} d(gx, y), and it asserts that the topology induced by this metric agrees with the quotient topology. It is a precise claim about a particular quotient and a particular construction of a metric, together with a topological agreement statement.
- The Lean theorem only asserts the existence of some equivalence relation R and some metric space structure on its quotient. It does not:
  - Use the orbit relation (the defined `orbit_rel` is never referenced in the theorem).
  - Specify that R is the orbit equivalence of the Γ-action.
  - Specify that the metric is the “infimum metric” d(\bar{x}, \bar{y}) = inf_{g} d(gx, y).
  - Assert that the metric topology agrees with the quotient topology.
  - Tie the metric construction to the action or to hIsometry in any way within the conclusion.
- Moreover, the conclusion includes `True`, which adds nothing and makes the statement even more vacuous. The existence of some Setoid and some metric structure on its quotient is far too weak and unrelated to the intended specific construction.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is vastly weaker and does not pin down the quotient, the metric, nor the topology agreement. The auxiliary definition `orbit_rel` is legitimate but unused, which is a red flag for faithfulness. There are no vacuous placeholder definitions per se, but the main theorem’s conclusion is not the intended claim.

Grade rationale:
- Not faithful (score 0). The code does not match the specific quotient, metric, or topology agreement.
- Given the rubric, this sits very low: although the auxiliary definition isn’t vacuous, the main theorem is essentially unrelated to the precise statement. A low grade (around 3) reflects that even fixing proofs would not make the current theorem faithful without changing its statement considerably.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib and opens Algebra. There are no custom/vacuous definitions.

1) Theorem `finite_dimensional_real_field_eq_R_or_C`:
   Statement: For any type `k` with `[Field k]` and an `ℝ`-algebra structure `[Algebra ℝ k]` that is finite-dimensional over `ℝ` (`[FiniteDimensional ℝ k]`), we have
   `(Nonempty (AlgEquiv ℝ k ℝ)) ∨ (Nonempty (AlgEquiv ℝ k Complex))`.
   Natural language: If `k` is a field containing `ℝ` (encoded by an `ℝ`-algebra structure) and finite-dimensional as an `ℝ`-vector space, then `k` is isomorphic (as an `ℝ`-algebra) to `ℝ` or to `ℂ`.
   Assessment: This matches the first main claim “Then k = ℝ or k = ℂ, up to isomorphism.”

2) Theorem `finite_dim_field_extension_is_R_or_C`:
   Statement: Identical hypotheses and identical conclusion as the previous theorem, phrased as a corollary.
   Natural language: Same classification result. The comment suggests it implies the splitting-field degree corollary, but the code does not formalize that implication.
   Assessment: Redundant with (1); does not harm but does not add the missing corollary.

3) Theorem `complex_is_algebraically_closed`:
   Statement: `IsAlgClosed Complex`.
   Natural language: This is the fundamental theorem of algebra (every complex polynomial splits into linear factors over `ℂ`).
   Assessment: This formalizes the second “in particular” statement (that every complex polynomial splits over `ℂ`). While the code does not explicitly phrase “every polynomial splits into linear factors”, `IsAlgClosed Complex` is the standard Mathlib statement equivalent to that fact.

Comparison with the original statement:
- Main classification: Faithfully captured by theorem (1).
- Corollary about splitting fields having degree ≤ 2 over ℝ: Not formalized anywhere. The comment in theorem (2) mentions it informally but there is no Lean statement about splitting fields or degrees/finrank ≤ 2.
- Corollary that every complex polynomial splits into linear factors over ℂ: Captured via `IsAlgClosed Complex` in theorem (3).

No vacuous placeholders or fake definitions are introduced; all notions used (`Field`, `Algebra`, `FiniteDimensional`, `AlgEquiv`, `IsAlgClosed`) are standard Mathlib concepts. Proofs are omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Final check:
- The code is a faithful formalization of the main classification and of the FTA consequence, but it omits the explicit statement about splitting fields over ℝ having degree at most 2. Hence the translation is incomplete (missing one of the “in particular” parts), though otherwise accurate.

Grade rationale:
- Nearly faithful but missing one corollary: assign 9.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The comment explains the intended mathematical content: given a topological space X and a path p : Path x0 x1, the conjugation map on fundamental groups sends [y] (a loop class at x0) to [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)] (a loop class at x1), and this should define a group isomorphism FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* FundamentalGroup X x1.
- `variable (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X]` sets up a topological space X.
- `def fundamental_group_conj {x0 x1 : X} (p : Path x0 x1) : FundamentalGroup X x0 ≃* FundamentalGroup X x1 := by sorry` declares a definition that is supposed to produce a group isomorphism between the fundamental groups at x0 and x1, given a path p. However, the body is `by sorry`, meaning the object (the isomorphism and its data: toFun, invFun, proofs) is not actually provided; it is a placeholder relying on the sorry axiom.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asserts that the specific assignment [y] ↦ [\bar x*(y*x)] induces a group isomorphism π1(X,x0) → π1(X,x1).
- In Lean, the intended assignment corresponds to `p.symm.trans (y.trans p)` (since `p.symm` is the reversed path \bar x and `trans` is concatenation). The docstring says exactly this mapping.
- However, the code does not define the map; it merely asserts a def returning an isomorphism and fills it with `sorry`. Crucially, there is no specification in the formal object tying the isomorphism to the given assignment. The doc comment is non-binding; the actual term is not provided. So formally, the code only asserts the existence of some group isomorphism, not that it is induced by the specific conjugation map.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Natural language: “the assignment [y] ↦ [\bar x*(y*x)] induces an isomorphism”. This specifies the concrete isomorphism given by conjugation along the path.
- Lean code: declares there is a group isomorphism between π1(X,x0) and π1(X,x1) given a path p, but provides no definition of the function and no proof. Since the data is not constructed and not constrained to the specific assignment, the formal statement does not faithfully encode that the isomorphism is the one coming from [y] ↦ [p.symm.trans (y.trans p)].
- Therefore, while the intended meaning is clearly stated in the comment and the type matches the existence of an isomorphism parameterized by p, the actual formal content does not capture the assignment and uses a sorry placeholder for the entire isomorphism, making it non-faithful as a translation of the specific statement.

Conclusion: The code is very close in intent and statement shape, but fails faithfulness because it does not formally define the specified map and uses a sorry to supply the entire isomorphism.

A subset `U ⊆ Option X` is declared open iff either (i) `none ∉ U` and the preimage of `U` under the inclusion `some : X → Option X` is open in `X`, or (ii) `none ∈ U` and there exists a compact `C ⊆ X` such that `U = {none} ∪ (some '' (X \ C))`. This matches the standard one-point compactification description, using the canonical embedding `some` to identify `X` with `Option X \ {none}`.
- `def one_point_compactification (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : TopologicalSpace (Option X) := by sorry`: This purports to define a topology on `Option X` but leaves the entire construction/proof as `sorry`. No `IsOpen` predicate nor proofs of the topology axioms are provided; the definition is a placeholder.

2) Does the whole Lean snippet faithfully translate the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement asks to prove that the described collection of sets defines a topology on `\overline{X} = X ∪ {∞}` (the standard one-point compactification). The comment in the Lean code aligns well with the intended open sets: it exactly mirrors the two cases, with the minor formalization detail of using `some` to embed `X` into `Option X`.
- However, the actual definition is missing; it is replaced by `sorry`. Therefore, the code does not provide a legitimate construction of the topology nor the verification of the topology axioms. It does not meet the requirement to “prove that this defines a topology”.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Conceptually, the intended object in the comment is the same as the natural language specification. The use of `preimage under some` vs. “U open in X” is a standard formalization detail and is equivalent when `none ∉ U`. The second case `U = {none} ∪ (some '' (X \ C))` matches `U = {∞} ∪ (X \ C)` via the embedding.
- The crucial discrepancy is that the Lean code does not actually define the topology or prove the axioms; it is a vacuous placeholder using `sorry`. According to the guidelines, this fails faithfulness since auxiliary definitions are not legitimately provided.

Conclusion: Although the comment describes the correct topology, the code does not implement it and uses a vacuous `sorry`. If the `sorry` were replaced by a proper construction, it would be faithful. As-is, it fails.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: X, Y, Z are types with topological spaces, matching the context of the statement.
- def is_covering_map (f : X → Y) : Prop := True: This is a placeholder/vacuous predicate; it declares every map to be a covering map. This is not the real mathlib definition and is a red flag per the guidelines.
- Theorem covering_map_lift_unique: Given f : X → Y, an assumption hf : is_covering_map f (the placeholder), a Hausdorff assumption hX : T2Space X, maps g₁, g₂ : Z → X with hfg : f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ (i.e., they compose to the same map into Y), and a point z0 : Z with h0 : g₁ z0 = g₂ z0, conclude g₁ = g₂. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for checking translation of the statement.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The logical content of the theorem (ignoring the placeholder) matches the natural language: uniqueness of lifts for a covering map from a Hausdorff space X, stated via equality f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ and agreement at one point implying g₁ = g₂.
- However, the critical assumption ""f is a covering map"" is encoded by a vacuous predicate is_covering_map := True. This makes the theorem statement logically weaker (it claims uniqueness holds for all f, since the hypothesis is always true) and thus not faithful to the intended meaning.
- All other aspects (Hausdorff assumption on X, topological structure on Y and Z, the condition f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂, and agreement at a point) align with the natural language statement.

Final check:
- Same problem? No. The Lean code uses a vacuous placeholder for ""covering map,"" thereby not faithfully capturing the condition that f must be a covering map. If the placeholder were replaced by the real definition, the statement would be faithful.
- No other auxiliary vacuous definitions beyond is_covering_map. The use of hfg in place of explicitly introducing a map h : Z → Y is a standard and acceptable formalization.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous covering map predicate, but would be faithful if that were fixed.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib's topology library.
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: X and Y are types equipped with topological space structures.

  This asserts: For a function f from X to Y between topological spaces, f is continuous if and only if for every subset A of Y, the closure in X of the preimage of A equals the preimage under f of the closure in Y of A. Notation: `closure` is topological closure; `f ⁻¹' A` is preimage of A under f.

2) Whole translation vs. natural language:
The natural language statement says: Let f: X → Y be a map of topological spaces. Show that f is continuous iff for every subset A ⊆ Y one has  overline(f^{-1}(A)) = f^{-1}(overline(A)). The Lean theorem states exactly the same equivalence with the same quantification over all subsets A of Y and the same equality. The mathematical objects and conditions (topological spaces on X and Y, continuity of f, closure, preimage) align perfectly.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantification: Both state “for every subset A of Y.” Matched by `∀ A : Set Y`.
- Equality and objects: `closure (f ⁻¹' A) = f ⁻¹' (closure A)` matches `\overline{f^{-1}(A)} = f^{-1}(\overline{A})`.
- Hypotheses: Only topological structures on X and Y are assumed, matching the natural language.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem directly states the equivalence.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The context fixes a group Γ, spaces X and Y with topologies, and a (continuous) action of Γ on X (MulAction Γ X). A topology on Γ is also assumed so we can talk about compactness of subsets of Γ.
- The theorem exists_point_with_compact_stabilizer_and_compact_transversal assumes a map q : X → Y with the properties:
  • hq_cont: q is continuous.
  • hq_surj: q is surjective.
  • hq_iff: q identifies points exactly when they lie in the same Γ-orbit, i.e., q x = q y ↔ ∃ g : Γ, g • x = y.
  • hY_comp: Y is compact (IsCompact univ).
- Conclusion (two parts):
  • For every x0 in X, there exists x in the orbit of x0 (∃ g, x = g • x0) such that the stabilizer {γ : Γ | γ • x = x} is compact as a subset of Γ.
  • There exists a compact subset K ⊆ X that meets every orbit: for every x0 ∈ X, there exists y ∈ K and g ∈ Γ with g • x0 = y.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The informal statement: If a group Γ acts on a topological space X and the orbit space X/Γ is compact, then every orbit contains a point with compact stabilizer, and there exists a compact subset K ⊆ X meeting every Γ-orbit.
- The Lean statement replaces “X/Γ is compact” by the existence of a continuous surjection q : X → Y onto a compact space Y which identifies exactly the orbit equivalence classes (q x = q y iff y is in the Γ-orbit of x). This is a standard way to formalize the quotient-by-orbits without directly using quotient types. The conclusions match exactly the two claims: existence of a point in each orbit with compact stabilizer, and existence of a compact transversal K intersecting every orbit.

3) Are they the same?
- The Lean hypothesis is slightly more general/less specific: it does not require that Y carries the quotient topology or that q is a quotient map in the topological sense; it only requires continuity, surjectivity, and identification of orbits, plus compactness of Y. This is weaker than assuming “the topological quotient X/Γ is compact” because even if the actual topological quotient were non-compact, one could (in principle) endow the set of orbits with a coarser compact topology making q continuous. Hence the Lean theorem is a slight generalization of the natural language statement.
- This generalization is a reasonable formalization approach and does not introduce any vacuity or placeholders. All auxiliary structures are standard Mathlib classes; there are no made-up/vacuous definitions. The conclusions precisely express the two desired properties.
- Minor note: the Lean code assumes only a topology on Γ (not a topological group structure), which suffices to state “compact stabilizer.” The natural language implicitly requires a topology on Γ to talk about compactness; the Lean assumptions are compatible and arguably slightly more general.

Overall, the formal statement faithfully captures the intended result, with a benign generalization in how the compact orbit space is modeled.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language asks to prove (A × B)° = A° × B° and cl(A) × cl(B) = cl(A × B). The Lean code states exactly these, with standard notation: `interior` for interior, `closure` for closure, and `×ˢ` for set product.
- The closure equality is stated with the sides swapped (closure(A × B) = closure A × closure B) but equality is symmetric, so it's the same statement.
- The natural language mentions only one topological space X, but uses a product A × B; typically this requires two spaces X and Y (or subsets of X and Y). The Lean code correctly handles the general case with two spaces α and β. This is a harmless and standard generalization, aligning with the intended meaning.

3) Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; just theorem statements with `sorry` proofs, which is acceptable per the task.
- The math content matches exactly (up to symmetry of equality and a slight generalization to two spaces). Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def amalgamated_free_product {ι : Type v} (G : ι → Type u) (R : ι → ι → Type u) : Type u := PUnit.{u}`
  This defines a placeholder type for the amalgamated free product of a family of types G_i over pairwise data R_{ij}, but it is literally defined to be `PUnit` (a one-point type). It ignores the input data entirely and does not encode any algebraic structure or universal property. It is explicitly a stub.

- The theorem `van_kampen_amalgamation` takes:
  - A topological space `X`, an index type `ι`, a family of sets `U : ι → Set X`, and a basepoint `x0 : X`.
  - Hypotheses: the `U i` cover `X` ((⋃ i, U i) = univ), `X` is path connected (`IsPathConnected univ`), each `U i` is open and contains `x0`, each `U i` is path connected, and each pairwise intersection `U i ∩ U j` is path connected.
  - Conclusion: There exists an equivalence of types (`≃`) between `FundamentalGroup X x0` and the placeholder `amalgamated_free_product` applied to the family of fundamental groups of the subspaces `Subtype (U i)` at the basepoint, and similarly for intersections `Subtype (U i ∩ U j)`. The proof is admitted with `by sorry`.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is a van Kampen style result: for a path connected, locally simply connected space `X` with a cover by path connected open sets with path connected intersections, all containing `x0`, the fundamental group π1(X, x0) is the amalgamated free product of the π1(X_a, x0) over the π1(X_{ab}, x0). This asserts a group-level universal property/isomorphism of groups.

Major discrepancies:
1) Placeholder/vacuous definition: `amalgamated_free_product` is defined as `PUnit`. This makes the target of the supposed isomorphism trivial and independent of input, so the statement is not a legitimate rendering of the amalgamated free product. This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders.
2) Missing crucial hypothesis: The code does not assume that `X` is locally simply connected, which is part of the natural language assumptions.
3) Wrong notion of equivalence: The code asserts a type equivalence (`≃`) rather than a group isomorphism (`≃*` or similar). The fundamental group is a group; the result should be about isomorphism of groups, not mere bijection of underlying types.
4) Missing structure/morphisms for amalgamation: An amalgamated free product needs inclusion homomorphisms π1(U_i ∩ U_j) → π1(U_i) and π1(U_i ∩ U_j) → π1(U_j). The placeholder type only takes the family of types and a family of pairwise types; it does not take or encode the necessary group homomorphisms. Hence even a non-placeholder version with this signature would be insufficient.
5) Proof omitted with `sorry`: While allowed as an admitted statement, it reinforces that the code is only a stub, not a faithful formalization.

Minor notes:
- The hypotheses about path connectivity and openness of sets and intersections match part of the natural statement.
- Using `FundamentalGroup (Subtype (U i)) ⟨x0, ...⟩` correctly models π1(U_i, x0) as a fundamental group of the subspace with induced topology.

Final check: The Lean code does not faithfully formalize the natural language theorem. It lacks the locally simply connected hypothesis, uses a vacuous placeholder for the amalgamated product, asserts only a type equivalence (not a group isomorphism), and does not encode the necessary inclusion homomorphisms. Thus the two statements are materially different.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context/variables:
  - X is a topological space with a chosen basepoint x0.
  - Γ is a group.
  - φ : FundamentalGroup X x0 →* Γ is a group homomorphism.
  - Xφ is a type with a topology, and pφ : Xφ → X is a map.
  - Γ acts on Xφ (MulAction Γ Xφ).
  - path_conn : PathConnectedSpace X and locally_simply_connected : Prop are declared, but only as variables, not assumptions used later.

- Theorem covering_space_from_group_morphism:
  - Statement: ∃ (Y : Type*) (htop : TopologicalSpace Y) (p : Y → X) (act : MulAction Γ Y), Continuous p.
  - Natural language: There exists some topological space Y, a continuous map p : Y → X, and a Γ-action on Y.
  - Issues: This does not mention covering spaces at all, does not use φ, Xφ, or pφ, does not assert a Γ-covering, does not assert any isomorphism Γ ≅ π₁(X), and does not use the path connected or locally simply connected assumptions.

- Theorem classification_of_connected_Gamma_coverings:
  - Statement: Given Y with a topology, p : Y → X, a Γ-action on Y, Continuous p, and ConnectedSpace Y, there exists ψ : FundamentalGroup X x0 →* Γ such that True (i.e., just ∃ ψ with no further relation).
  - Natural language: For any connected Y with a continuous p and Γ-action, there exists a group morphism ψ from π₁(X) to Γ (with no constraints and no connection to Y or p), since the conclusion is simply ∃ ψ, True.
  - Issues: No covering space hypothesis (neither covering map nor Γ-covering), no relation tying ψ to Y → X so as to say Y arises from ψ, and no use of path-connectedness or local simple connectivity. The conclusion is vacuous relative to classification.

Comparison to the original statement:
- Original hypothesis: X is path connected and locally simply connected; Γ is a group; given φ : π₁(X) → Γ and a Γ-action on Xφ, the map pφ : Xφ → X is a Γ-covering space with Γ ≅ π₁(X); and any connected Γ-covering Y → X arises from this construction for some φ.
- Lean code does not:
  - State or use path connectedness or local simple connectivity in the theorems.
  - Mention covering maps or Γ-coverings at all.
  - Use φ, Xφ, or pφ in the conclusions.
  - Assert Γ ≅ π₁(X) (or any isomorphism/deck group statement).
  - Provide a classification tying a connected Γ-covering Y → X to a ψ: π₁(X) → Γ that produces Y.
- Furthermore, the second theorem's conclusion (∃ ψ, True) is essentially contentless relative to classification and ignores the assumptions on Y and p.

Final check: The two math problems are different. The Lean statements are extremely weak compared to the original classification theorem and do not encode the essential notions (covering, Γ-covering, isomorphism with π₁, dependence on φ, or the arises-from-this-construction clause). Thus the translation is not faithful.

Additional notes:
- While the theorems are marked “Statement only” and use sorry (acceptable for omitted proofs), the core issue is that the statements themselves do not formalize the intended mathematics.
- The variable locally_simply_connected is merely a Prop placeholder and is unused; this further underscores the mismatch.

Overall judgment: Not faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `def gram (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ := Matrix.transpose M * M`
  This defines the Gram matrix of the columns of an n×n real matrix M: gram(M) = Mᵀ M. Entrywise, (gram M)_{ij} = ⟨column_i(M), column_j(M)⟩ with the standard Euclidean inner product.

- The theorem `exists_continuous_g`:
  • Input: a function `f : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ → ℝ` together with `hf : Continuous f` and an invariance hypothesis
    `hU : ∀ U, Uᵀ U = 1 → ∀ M, f (U * M) = f M`.
    This says f is continuous and invariant under left multiplication by orthogonal matrices U (Uᵀ U = I), i.e., simultaneous orthogonal transformations of all columns.
  • Conclusion: there exists a function
    `g : {A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // ∃ M, A = gram M} → ℝ`,
    which is continuous, and satisfies `∀ M, g ⟨gram M, ⟨M, rfl⟩⟩ = f M`.
    The domain of g is the subtype of matrices that occur as a Gram matrix of some M; evaluating g at the Gram matrix of M recovers f(M).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: f is a continuous function of n vectors v₁,…,vₙ ∈ ℝⁿ, invariant under simultaneous orthogonal transformations: f(U v₁,…,U vₙ) = f(v₁,…,vₙ) for all U ∈ O(n). Let Y be the set of positive semidefinite symmetric n×n matrices. Then there exists a continuous g : Y → ℝ such that f(v₁,…,vₙ) = g(A), where A is the Gram matrix with entries A_{ij} = ⟨v_i, v_j⟩.

- Identification: arranging the vectors v₁,…,vₙ as the columns of M ∈ ℝ^{n×n}, the invariance f(Uv₁,…,Uvₙ) matches f(U*M) = f(M). The Gram matrix A of the vectors is exactly gram(M) = Mᵀ M.

- The set Y equals the image of the map M ↦ Mᵀ M: it is precisely the set of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. The code uses Y implicitly as the subtype `{A | ∃ M, A = gram M}`, which is (mathematically) the same set.

- The conclusion matches: existence of a continuous g on Y such that g(gram(M)) = f(M) for every M (i.e., for every tuple of vectors).

Step 3: Final check: are the two statements the same?
- Domain of f: tuples of vectors vs matrices with those columns — equivalent in finite dimensions.
- Orthogonal invariance: f(Uv_i) vs f(U*M) — identical condition.
- Y: PSD symmetric matrices vs the image of M ↦ Mᵀ M — these sets coincide.
- Conclusion: existence of continuous g on Y such that f depends only on the Gram matrix — identical.

No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; `gram` is a legitimate definition. The theorem statement faithfully represents the mathematical statement, including continuity and invariance assumptions and the correct target set for g. The slight presentational difference (defining Y as the image of gram rather than “PSD symmetric”) is mathematically equivalent.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `constant Serre_fibration {X : Type u} {Y : Type v} (f : X → Y) : Prop`
  Introduces an uninterpreted predicate “Serre_fibration f” on arbitrary functions f : X → Y between plain types. No topological structure is assumed or used.

- `def fiber {X : Type u} {Y : Type v} (f : X → Y) (y0 : Y) := Subtype (fun x : X => f x = y0)`
  Defines the fiber over y0 as the subtype {x : X | f x = y0}. This matches the usual set-theoretic fiber (not requiring topology).

- `constant π (n : ℕ) (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z) : Type v`
  Introduces an uninterpreted type meant to stand for the n-th homotopy group of a pointed space (Z, z0). However, Z is just a type (no topology), and π is not defined, only postulated as a type.

- `constant is_long_exact_sequence ... : Prop`
  Introduces an uninterpreted predicate that, given f, basepoints x0,y0 with h : f x0 = y0, and maps i, j, δ with types mirroring π_n(F) → π_n(X), π_n(X) → π_n(Y), π_n(Y) → π_{n-1}(F), returns a proposition. This does not define exactness; it is a placeholder name only.

- `theorem serre_fibration_long_exact_sequence ... (hf : Serre_fibration f) : ∃ i j δ, is_long_exact_sequence f x0 y0 h i j δ := by sorry`
  States that if f is a Serre_fibration (in the uninterpreted sense), then there exist maps i, j, δ such that the placeholder predicate is_long_exact_sequence holds. The proof is omitted (`sorry`). Note that i, j, δ are merely existentially asserted; they are not identified with the “obvious” maps induced by inclusion and f, nor is δ specified as the connecting homomorphism. Also, δ is typed as π n Y y0 → π (n - 1) (fiber f y0) ..., using natural-number subtraction, which for n = 0 gives π 0 Y → π 0 F (since 0 - 1 = 0 in Nat), not matching the standard low-degree behavior of the long exact sequence.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural statement: If f : X → Y is a Serre fibration (of topological spaces), then the obvious maps π_n(F,x_0) → π_n(X,x_0) → π_n(Y,y_0) fit into a long exact sequence ... with connecting morphisms π_n(Y,y_0) → π_{n-1}(F,x_0).

Issues in the code:
- Topology missing: X, Y are arbitrary types; no TopologicalSpace structure is assumed or used. Serre fibrations and homotopy groups are notions for topological spaces. 
- Vacuous placeholders: Serre_fibration, π, and is_long_exact_sequence are all declared as constants with no definitions. They do not capture the intended meanings.
- Weaker existential form: The theorem asserts the existence of some maps i, j, δ making a “long exact sequence”, without specifying that i and j are the induced maps from inclusion and f (i.e., the “obvious maps”). The natural statement explicitly refers to those specific maps. Thus, even with proper definitions, the formal statement is weaker than the intended one.
- Indexing/low-degree mismatch: The δ map is typed using n - 1 in ℕ, which for n = 0 becomes 0, producing a map π_0(Y) → π_0(F). This does not reflect the standard long exact sequence conventions at low degrees and suggests a mismatch at n = 0 unless one builds in special handling. The placeholder predicate hides these subtleties rather than resolving them.

Step 3: Final check
The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It relies on uninterpreted placeholders for core notions (Serre fibrations, homotopy groups, exactness), lacks required topological structures, and only asserts existence of some maps rather than the “obvious” induced maps. Additionally, the indexing for δ via natural subtraction is dubious for n = 0. Therefore, the two statements are not the same.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the standard library, including topology.
- `variable {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Set X}` sets up a topological space X and a subset A ⊆ X.

First theorem:
- `theorem isClosed_subspace_iff {S : Set (Subtype A)} : IsClosed S ↔ ∃ C : Set X, IsClosed C ∧ S = {a : Subtype A | (a : X) ∈ C}`
  This says: a set S of points of the subtype `Subtype A` (i.e., the space A with the subspace topology) is closed if and only if there exists a closed set C in X such that S consists exactly of those a ∈ A whose underlying point in X lies in C. Equivalently, S = (coe)⁻¹'(C), i.e., S corresponds to A ∩ C as a subset of X. This matches the classical statement: closed subsets of A are exactly of the form A ∩ C with C closed in X.

Second theorem:
- `theorem closure_subspace {S : Set (Subtype A)} : closure S = {a : Subtype A | (a : X) ∈ closure ((coe : Subtype A → X) '' S)}`
  This says: the closure of S inside the subspace A equals the set of points a ∈ A whose underlying point in X lies in the closure in X of the image of S under the coercion `Subtype A → X`. Since `coe '' S` is the natural way to view S as a subset of X, this statement is exactly that the closure of S in A equals A ∩ closure_X(S), where S is regarded as a subset of X. In terms of sets: `closure_A(S) = coe⁻¹'(closure_X (coe '' S))`, which corresponds to A ∩ closure_X(S).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The first part precisely formalizes: “the closed subsets of A (with the subspace topology) are exactly the sets A ∩ C for C closed in X.” The Lean equality `S = {a | (a : X) ∈ C}` is the subtype version of S = A ∩ C.
- The second part matches: “the closure of S ⊆ A inside A equals the intersection of A with the closure of S in X.” The Lean expression uses `closure ((coe) '' S)` to interpret S as a subset of X and takes the preimage under `coe`, which is exactly intersecting with A.

No auxiliary fake definitions are introduced; the statements use standard Mathlib notions (IsClosed, closure, Subtype, image). The presence of `sorry` only indicates omitted proofs and does not affect the faithfulness of the statement translation.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are faithful to the natural language statements.

- import Mathlib; open Set: We work in Mathlib with sets.
- theorem van_kampen_covering_spaces {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Type*} (X_a : A → Set X): We fix a topological space X, an index type A, and a family of subsets X_a ⊆ X.
- (x0 : X) (ha : ∀ a, x0 ∈ X_a a): Choose a basepoint x0 ∈ X that lies in every X_a.
- (hpath : ∀ a, IsPathConnected (X_a a)): Each X_a is path connected (as a subspace).
- (hpath_inter : ∀ a b, IsPathConnected (X_a a ∩ X_a b)): Each pairwise intersection X_a ∩ X_b is path connected (as a subspace).
- (hcover : (⋃ a, X_a a) = (univ : Set X)): The X_a cover X.
- {Γ : Type*} [Group Γ]: Fix a target group Γ.
- (incl_a : ∀ a, FundamentalGroup ({x : X // x ∈ X_a a}) (⟨x0, ha a⟩) →* FundamentalGroup X x0): For each a, a group homomorphism from π1(X_a, x0) (implemented as the fundamental group of the subtype {x ∈ X | x ∈ X_a a}) to π1(X, x0). Intended to be induced by inclusion.

- (incl_compat : ∀ a b, (incl_a a).comp (incl_ab_a a b) = (incl_a b).comp (incl_ab_b a b)): Compatibility of these maps: the two ways to include π1(X_a ∩ X_b, x0) into π1(X, x0) agree.
- (φ : ∀ a, FundamentalGroup ({x : X // x ∈ X_a a}) (⟨x0, ha a⟩) →* Γ): For each a, a group morphism φ_a: π1(X_a, x0) → Γ.
- (φ_compat : ∀ a b, (φ a).comp (incl_ab_a a b) = (φ b).comp (incl_ab_b a b)): These morphisms agree on the intersections, i.e., φ_a ∘ (π1 inclusion from X_a∩X_b to X_a) = φ_b ∘ (π1 inclusion from X_a∩X_b to X_b).
- Conclusion: ∃! Φ : FundamentalGroup X x0 →* Γ, ∀ a, (Φ).comp (incl_a a) = φ a: There exists a unique group homomorphism Φ: π1(X, x0) → Γ whose restriction along each inclusion map incl_a agrees with φ_a. Proof omitted (sorry), but we only assess the statement.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: X is path connected and locally simply connected; {X_a} is a cover by path connected open sets with pairwise path connected intersections; take Γ and homomorphisms π1(X_a, x0) → Γ agreeing on π1(X_a∩X_b, x0); then there exists a unique π1(X, x0) → Γ extending them.
- Code: Matches the core universal property of van Kampen with basepoint x0 in each X_a, path connected X_a and pairwise intersections, and the agreement condition on intersections, concluding existence and uniqueness of the extension homomorphism.

Step 3: Differences and assessment.
- Missing openness: The code does not assume IsOpen (X_a a), whereas the natural statement explicitly requires open sets. This is a generalization/weakening in the formal statement.
- Missing local simple connectivity of X: The code does not assume X is locally simply connected, whereas the natural statement does. Again a generalization.
- Missing global path connectedness of X: The natural statement assumes X is path connected; the code does not. This is a further generalization. However, since the basepoint lies in all sets and the conclusion concerns a map from π1(X, x0) (which is defined regardless), this is not harmful for the statement’s form.
- Basepoint handling: The code fixes x0 ∈ X_a for all a, so it can form π1(X_a, x0) and π1(X_a∩X_b, x0). This matches the natural statement’s use of the same basepoint in all pieces.
- Inclusion maps: The code takes the induced maps on π1 as parameters (incl_a, incl_ab_*) with the expected compatibility; it does not assert they are literally induced by set-theoretic inclusion, but the types and compatibility clearly encode that intent and suffice for the extension property. This is an acceptable formalization choice.
- Intersections: The natural language uses the notation X_ab := X_a ∩ X_b and asks for path connectedness of these; the code assumes precisely pairwise intersections are path connected, matching that specific reading.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully captures the core universal property being asserted (existence and uniqueness of an extension π1(X, x0) → Γ from compatible maps on a path-connected cover with path-connected intersections), but it omits several hypotheses (openness of the cover sets, local simple connectivity of X, and path connectedness of X). These are meaningful assumptions in the usual van Kampen theorem, but their omission here is a generalization at the level of the statement; as a translation task, the core meaning is preserved. Therefore, it is almost entirely faithful, with minor hypothesis mismatches.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code into natural language.
- We work with types X and Y equipped with topological space structures.
- We fix an equivalence relation on X, modeled as a Setoid s : Setoid X. Its quotient is Quotient s.
- We define q : X → Quotient s to be the canonical quotient map, q = Quotient.mk s.
- Lemma continuous_iff_compose_quotient {h : Quotient s → Y}:
  This asserts the universal property of the quotient topology: h is continuous if and only if h ∘ q is continuous.
- Lemma continuous_descends_iff_constant_on_classes {F : X → Y} (hF : Continuous F):
  This asserts that for a continuous function F, the following are equivalent:
  (i) There exists a continuous h : Quotient s → Y such that h ∘ q = F.
  (ii) F is constant on equivalence classes: for all x1 x2, if Setoid.r s x1 x2 then F x1 = F x2.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- First part: “Show that any continuous map h : X/~ → Y induces a continuous map h ∘ q : X → Y.” The lemma gives a stronger equivalence: Continuous h ↔ Continuous (h ∘ q), so it fully covers this requirement (and more).
- Second part: “Conversely, show that a continuous map f : X → Y arises in this way (i.e., f = h ∘ q for a unique continuous h) iff f is constant on equivalence classes.” The lemma addresses existence and the iff with the ‘constant on classes’ condition, under the assumption F is continuous. However, it does not assert uniqueness of h. The natural language explicitly includes “unique continuous h”, which is standard in the universal property of quotients. The Lean statement only proves existence, not uniqueness.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness.
- The definitions used are legitimate (Setoid, Quotient, q = Quotient.mk s). No vacuous or fabricated auxiliary definitions.
- Proofs are omitted via admit, but the task is about translation, not proof, and the statements are meaningful mathlib-level statements.
- The only discrepancy is the missing uniqueness clause in the second lemma. Everything else aligns, with the first lemma even being slightly stronger than required.
- Therefore, the translation is very close but not fully faithful due to the omission of uniqueness in the factorization statement.

Grade rationale:
- Substantive match of mathematical content with a small but important omission (uniqueness). Hence, not fully faithful → faithful_score = 0. The quality is otherwise high → grade = 9.

- theorem homotopy_induces_conjugation_relation : (y_star ∘ f0_star) = (f1_star ∘ x_star) := by sorry: States an equality of compositions of those arbitrary functions and leaves the proof as sorry.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement assumes F is a homotopy (continuous in both variables) and defines y(t) = F(t, x(t)) from a path x in X. It ties y0 and y1 to f0 x0 and f1 x1. It defines x_* and y_* specifically as conjugation isomorphisms induced by the paths x and y. It defines (f0)_* and (f1)_* as the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups coming from continuous maps f0 and f1, at the appropriate basepoints. Then it asserts the relation y_* ∘ (f0)_* = (f1)_* ∘ x_*.
- The Lean code does not enforce continuity of F (no homotopy structure), does not introduce or use a path x : I → X, does not define y(t) from F and x, does not relate y0 and y1 to f0 x0 and f1 x1, and does not define x_* and y_* via conjugation. It also does not define (f0)_* and (f1)_* as induced maps; they are arbitrary functions with only matching types. Thus the core mathematical content tying these maps to F and the paths is missing.
- Moreover, the theorem as stated is an equality between arbitrary functions with no hypotheses; it does not mention F at all and therefore does not express the intended statement. The presence of sorry is an additional red flag per the guidelines.
- There is also a subtle basepoint mismatch issue: if f0_* is truly the induced map by f0, it should go π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, f0 x0); the code types it as π1(Y, y0) without any assumption that y0 = f0 x0.

Final check:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code is missing essential structures/relations (continuity/homotopy, specific paths, basepoint identifications, and the definitional linkage of the maps). It replaces them with arbitrary placeholders and asserts an unconditional equality. Therefore it is not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- There are multiple placeholder/vacuous components (arbitrary variables instead of defined maps; no linkage to F or paths; sorry). If these placeholders were replaced by legitimate definitions tying x_*, y_*, f0_*, f1_* to the given homotopy and paths with proper basepoint relations, the final theorem shape would match the intended statement. Hence this aligns with a grade around 6 per the rubric.

It relies on the standard TopologicalSpace instance on `Quotient s` provided by Mathlib, induced from X via q.
- `lemma continuous_descends_iff_constant_on_classes {F : X → Y} (hF : Continuous F) : (∃ (h : Quotient s → Y), (h ∘ q = F) ∧ Continuous h) ↔ (∀ x1 x2 : X, s x1 x2 → F x1 = F x2) := by sorry` states: given a continuous `F : X → Y`, there exists a continuous map `h : Quotient s → Y` with `h ∘ q = F` if and only if `F` is constant on equivalence classes (i.e., `F x1 = F x2` whenever `x1 ~ x2`). The existence of `h` corresponds to F descending to the quotient; continuity of `h` follows from the first lemma and the hypothesis `hF`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The first lemma exactly matches: ""A map h : X/∼ → Y is continuous iff h ∘ q : X → Y is continuous."" Here `Quotient s` is `X/∼` and `q` is the quotient map.
- The second lemma matches: ""Conversely, a continuous map F : X → Y descends to a continuous map X/∼ → Y iff F(x1)=F(x2) whenever x1 ∼ x2."" The left side is formalized as existence of `h : Quotient s → Y` with `h ∘ q = F` and `Continuous h`, and the right side is exactly the constant-on-equivalence-classes condition. The assumption `hF : Continuous F` aligns with ""a continuous map F"" and guarantees that the descended map is continuous.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; `q` is the standard quotient map, and the lemmas are legitimate statements without placeholders for concepts.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses Mathlib's standard `Quotient s` and `Setoid X`, consistent with the equivalence relation ∼.
- The topological structure on `Quotient s` is implicitly the quotient topology (provided by Mathlib), which is precisely what's needed for the stated properties.
- The quantifications and conditions match exactly. The second lemma includes the continuity of F as a hypothesis, matching the natural-language ""a continuous map F ... descends ... iff ..."".
- There are no mismatches, extra assumptions, or missing conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language and assess.
- E n := Fin n → ℝ. This models ℝ^n as functions from a finite index set to ℝ.
- F n := ℝ × E n. This models ℝ^{n+1} as ℝ × ℝ^n.
- eucl_norm x := sqrt(sum of squares of coordinates of x). This is the standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^n (noncomputable due to sqrt).
- eucl_norm_F z := sqrt(z.1^2 + sum of squares of z.2). This is the standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^{n+1} written as ℝ × ℝ^n.
- X := {x | eucl_norm x ≤ 1}. This is the closed unit ball in ℝ^n.
- A := {x | eucl_norm x = 1}. This is the boundary sphere of X.
- Y := {y | eucl_norm_F y = 1}. This is the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}.
- f x: define r = eucl_norm x. If r = 0, f(x) = (1, 0). If r ≠ 0, f(x) = (cos(π r), sin(π r) · (x/r)). Here (x/r) is implemented coordinatewise as r⁻¹ * x i. This matches the stated formula: f(x) = (cos(π‖x‖), sin(π‖x‖) x/‖x‖) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = (1, 0).
- f_injective_on_interior: The statement says if x,y ∈ X \ A (i.e., ‖x‖ < 1 and ‖y‖ < 1) and f x = f y, then x = y. This matches “f is injective on the interior X \ A”. No proof is provided (sorry), but the statement is correct.
- f_maps_A_to_neg_one: For a ∈ A (‖a‖ = 1), f a = (-1, 0). This exactly encodes that every boundary point maps to the single point (-1,0). The statement does not explicitly assert this point lies in Y, but since (-1, 0) has norm 1 in ℝ^{n+1}, that is immediate from the definitions.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- The code correctly models X as the closed unit ball, A as the boundary sphere, Y as the unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}, and f as specified by the given formula with the correct special value at 0.
- The first theorem statement exactly captures injectivity of f on the interior X \ A.
- The second theorem statement exactly captures that f maps every point of A to (-1,0).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code defines f as a function E n → F n (i.e., ℝ^n → ℝ^{n+1}), not as X → Y. It does not assert nor prove that f maps X into Y in its type. However, the formula used does map every x (in fact all of E n) into the unit sphere Y, and the two requested properties are stated precisely. This is a mild generalization/omission in typing, not a substantive mismatch with the problem's two claims.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: all auxiliary definitions are concrete and faithful. The theorems have sorry-proofs, which is allowed per instructions.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful to the mathematical content. The only minor deviation is not typing f as X → Y, but this does not affect the two target properties and is a standard formalization choice. Hence it passes.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: X is a type with a TopologicalSpace structure; A is an index type. U : A → Set X is a family of subsets of X. hUopen states each U a is open. hcover states that the union of all U a is all of X (univ), i.e., they cover X.
- x : ContinuousMap ℝ X is a continuous function from ℝ to X. The hypothesis hpath : x '' Icc 0 1 ⊆ univ is trivial (every set is a subset of univ) and carries no extra content.
- Conclusion: There exist a natural number n, a function t : ℕ → ℝ, and a function a : ℕ → A such that t 0 = 0, t n = 1, and for each i < n we have t i < t (i+1) and x '' Icc (t i) (t (i+1)) ⊆ U (a i). This asserts a finite strictly increasing sequence 0 = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_n = 1 together with indices a_0,...,a_{n-1} so that the image of each subinterval under x lies in a single U(a_i).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let X be covered by open sets {X_a}_a∈A and x : [0,1] → X a path; then there exist 0 = t_0 < ... < t_n = 1 and indices a_i with x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) ⊆ X_{a_i}.
- Lean statement matches the cover and openness assumptions and the existence of a finite partition and indices satisfying the containment of the image of each subinterval.

Differences:
- Domain of x: The natural statement has x defined on [0,1], whereas the Lean code assumes x : ℝ → X (continuous on the entire real line). This is a mild specialization (stronger hypothesis), and one can extend any continuous [0,1]→X map to a continuous ℝ→X map by making it constant outside [0,1], so this difference is acceptable as a slight specialization.
- Extra hypothesis hpath is trivial and unused. It does not affect the meaning of the statement.
- The code uses Set.image x (Icc ...) for x([t_i, t_{i+1}]); this is equivalent.

No auxiliary fake/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement is given (with sorry for the proof, which is acceptable for this auditing task). The mathematical content of the Lean statement faithfully represents the intended natural language statement up to the mild specialization of x's domain and an extraneous trivial hypothesis.

Final check: The two problems are essentially the same. Minor differences (domain ℝ vs [0,1], trivial extra hypothesis) do not change the core content. Hence it is a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def I : Set ℝ := Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1` defines the unit interval I = [0,1] as a subset of ℝ.
- The lemma `reparametrization_homotopic_rel_endpoints` takes a topological space X and functions `x y : ℝ → X` and `τ : ℝ → ℝ`. It assumes:
  • `hx : ContinuousOn x I` and `hy : ContinuousOn y I`: x and y are continuous on [0,1].
  • `hτ : ContinuousOn τ I`: τ is continuous on [0,1].
  • `hτ_image : τ '' I ⊆ I`: τ maps [0,1] into [0,1]. This formalizes that τ has codomain [0,1].
  • `hstrict : StrictMonoOn τ I`: τ is strictly increasing on [0,1].
  • `h0 : τ 0 = 0`, `h1 : τ 1 = 1`: τ fixes the endpoints.
  • `hreparam : ∀ t ∈ I, y (τ t) = x t`: y ∘ τ = x on [0,1] (reparametrization condition).
- The conclusion states the existence of a continuous map `H : ℝ × ℝ → X` that is continuous on `I.prod I` (i.e., on [0,1] × [0,1]) and satisfies the boundary conditions:
  • For all t ∈ [0,1], `H (t, 0) = x t` and `H (t, 1) = y t` (H is a homotopy from x to y).
  • For all s ∈ [0,1], `H (0, s) = x 0` and `H (1, s) = x 1` (the homotopy fixes endpoints 0 and 1 for all time). Since `y ∘ τ = x` and `τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1`, we have `y 0 = x 0` and `y 1 = x 1`, so fixing x’s endpoints is the same as fixing y’s endpoints.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language states: X is a topological space; x, y : [0,1] → X are paths; τ : [0,1] → [0,1] is continuous and strictly increasing with τ(0)=0, τ(1)=1, and y ∘ τ = x. Conclude x is homotopic to y relative to {0,1}.
- The Lean code matches this: it models [0,1] as the subset I ⊆ ℝ, uses ContinuousOn on I for domain continuity, enforces τ maps I into I, is strictly increasing, continuous, fixes endpoints, and enforces y ∘ τ = x on I. The conclusion asserts existence of a homotopy H continuous on I × I with the standard boundary conditions that fix the endpoints for all s, i.e., homotopic relative to {0,1}.
- Representing functions as ℝ → X with continuity restricted to I is a standard and faithful formalization of [0,1] → X paths. The product continuity on I × I is likewise standard.

3) Final check of differences:
- Minor technical formalization differences (using ContinuousOn on I, ℝ × ℝ with domain restricted to I × I) are acceptable and faithful. No vacuous or fake definitions are used. All hypotheses match the natural language, including endpoint conditions and reparametrization condition.
- The boundary conditions exactly encode “relative to {0,1}”.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- def X : Type := { t : ℝ // t ∈ Icc 0 1 }
  Natural language: X is the closed interval [0,1] realized as a subtype of ℝ.

- def f (t : X) : ℝ × ℝ := (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi * t.val), Real.sin (2 * Real.pi * t.val))
  Natural language: Define f: X → ℝ² by f(t) = (cos(2π t), sin(2π t)).

- def Y : Type := { p : ℝ × ℝ // p ∈ Set.range (fun t : X => f t) }
  Natural language: Y is the image of f, i.e., Y = {(cos(2π t), sin(2π t)) | t ∈ [0,1]} ⊆ ℝ².

- def r (a b : X) : Prop := f a = f b
  Natural language: Define an equivalence relation on X by a ~ b iff f(a) = f(b). For this specific f on [0,1], that identifies exactly 0 and 1 and no other distinct points.

- noncomputable def s : Setoid X := ...
  Natural language: Package r into a Setoid (equivalence relation). The reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity are given by equality properties of f a.

- noncomputable def quotient_Icc_endpoints_homeomorphic_circle {instQ : TopologicalSpace (Quotient s)} {instY : TopologicalSpace Y} : Homeomorph (Quotient s) Y := by sorry
  Natural language: Claim: the quotient of X by the relation s is homeomorphic to Y. The statement is given with (implicit) topological structures on the quotient and on Y as parameters; proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement asks to identify 0 and 1 in X and assert the quotient X/{0,1} is homeomorphic to Y = {(cos(2π t), sin(2π t)) | t ∈ [0,1]}.
- The code defines the equivalence relation via the kernel of f, i.e., a ~ b ⇔ f(a) = f(b). For this particular f (the standard circle parametrization over [0,1]), this equivalence indeed identifies only the endpoints 0 and 1 and no other distinct points. Thus the quotient by s matches the quotient identifying 0 and 1.
- Y is defined exactly as the image set described in the natural language statement.
- Therefore, conceptually, the quotient space Quotient s is the same quotient space X/{0,1} intended, and the target Y is the same subset of ℝ² intended.

3) Differences and potential issues:
- The only notable mismatch is that the final declaration quantifies over arbitrary topological space structures {instQ : TopologicalSpace (Quotient s)} and {instY : TopologicalSpace Y} rather than using the canonical/subtype and quotient topologies as typeclass instances. This makes the Lean statement stronger than intended (it asserts a homeomorphism for any chosen topologies), whereas the natural language statement is about the canonical quotient topology on X/{0,1} and the subspace topology on Y. If we interpret these as the intended instances (which is standard in Mathlib), then the statement aligns perfectly; but strictly as written, it is slightly overgeneralized.
- Aside from this, there are no vacuous placeholders: X, f, Y, and s are all concrete and faithful to the mathematics. The use of the kernel relation matches the intended endpoint identification for this particular f.

Conclusion: Aside from the overgeneralization of the topology parameters, the translation is faithful. The main mathematical content matches the original statement.
