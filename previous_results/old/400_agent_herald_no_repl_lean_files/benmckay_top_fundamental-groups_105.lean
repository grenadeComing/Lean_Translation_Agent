/-- Let X be a topological space and let x : I → X be a path from x(0) = x0 to x(1) = x1.
For any loop y based at x0, consider the loop reverse x * (y * x) based at x1.
The assignment [y] ↦ [reverse x * (y * x)] induces an isomorphism of groups
π_1(X, x0) → π_1(X, x1).

This statement is recorded here as a theorem declaration; a full proof is omitted. -/
