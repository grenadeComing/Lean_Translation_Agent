3) Final check:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; it uses Mathlib's `Ring` typeclass.
- The hypotheses match exactly: a general (not necessarily commutative) ring and arbitrary element a.
- The two separate equalities are logically equivalent to the chain equality in the statement.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

  This declares a theorem for any type R with a ring structure and elements a, b in R. The statement is a conjunction of two equalities:
  - `a * (-b) = -(a * b)` and
  - `-(a * b) = (-a) * b`.

The natural language statement is: For a ring R and elements a, b ∈ R, show that a(-b) = −(ab) = (−a)b. In Lean, the theorem asserts exactly the two component equalities that make up this chain equality: a(-b) equals −(ab), and −(ab) equals (−a)b. Thus, it faithfully captures the intended statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumptions: Lean assumes `[Ring R]`, matching the natural language “R is a ring.” This is standard and appropriate.
- Form: The chain equality in natural language is expressed as a conjunction of the two equalities in Lean, which is logically equivalent.

  Natural language: Let n be a natural number with n > 1. Let a and b be elements of the ring Z/nZ. If a is a unit in Z/nZ, then there exists x in Z/nZ such that a · x = b in Z/nZ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:

3) Final check for differences:
- The Lean theorem quantifies over a, b as elements of ZMod n rather than integers modulo n, which is standard and equivalent to talking about their classes [a], [b].
- Requires n > 1, as in the natural language statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement is exactly the algebraic form of the congruence.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem cong_add {n : Int} (hn : n ≠ 0) {a b c d : Int} ...` declares integers n, a, b, c, d, with the extra assumption that n ≠ 0.
- Hypothesis `h1 : ∃ k : Int, a - b = n * k` expresses that n divides a − b, i.e., a ≡ b (mod n).
- Hypothesis `h2 : ∃ l : Int, c - d = n * l` expresses that n divides c − d, i.e., c ≡ d (mod n).
- Conclusion `∃ m : Int, a + c - (b + d) = n * m` expresses that n divides (a + c) − (b + d), i.e., a + c ≡ b + d (mod n).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For a fixed positive integer n and integers a, b, c, d, if a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod n).
- The Lean version uses the standard divisibility characterization of congruence modulo n: n ∣ (a − b) and n ∣ (c − d) imply n ∣ ((a + c) − (b + d)). This is equivalent to the congruence conclusion. So the logical content matches perfectly.

3) Comparison and differences:
- The only difference is the assumption on n: the natural language says n is positive, whereas the Lean theorem only assumes n ≠ 0. This is a slight generalization (weaker assumption) that still implies the original statement when n is positive. This is acceptable.
- They do not use Mathlib's ModEq predicate but an equivalent divisibility formulation via existence of an integer multiple. This is a faithful alternative formulation.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with hypotheses exactly encoding the congruences.

Therefore, the code is a faithful (indeed slightly more general) translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in Mathlib. No effect on the statement itself.
- The docstring restates the problem and clarifies that congruence a ≡ b (mod n) is expressed as `n ∣ (a - b)`.
- `theorem modeq_add_mul {n a b c d : Int} (hn : 0 < n) (hab : n ∣ a - b) (hcd : n ∣ c - d) : n ∣ (a + c - (b + d)) ∧ n ∣ (a * c - b * d) := by sorry`
  Natural language translation: Let n, a, b, c, d be integers, with n > 0. Assume n divides a − b and n divides c − d. Then n divides (a + c) − (b + d), and n divides a c − b d. The concluding conjunction matches the two desired congruences.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asserts: for a positive integer n and integers a, b, c, d with a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), prove a + c ≡ b + d (mod n) and ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- In Lean, congruence mod n over ℤ is represented by divisibility of differences: `n ∣ (a - b)` etc. The hypotheses `(hab : n ∣ a - b)` and `(hcd : n ∣ c - d)` exactly encode the given congruences.
- The conclusions `n ∣ (a + c - (b + d))` and `n ∣ (a * c - b * d)` exactly encode the two target congruences.
- The assumption `0 < n` matches “n is a fixed positive integer.”
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no cheating or placeholders. The formulation is standard and faithful.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem is equivalent to the original statement, using standard equivalence between congruence mod n and divisibility by n in ℤ, and includes the exact positivity condition on n. No differences or mismatches.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def approx (a b : Real) : Prop := ∃ z : Int, a - b = (z : Real)` defines a binary relation on the reals: a approx b iff there exists an integer z such that a − b equals z (viewed in ℝ). This is exactly the statement that a − b ∈ ℤ.
- `theorem approx_refl : ∀ a : Real, approx a a := by sorry` states reflexivity: for every real a, a approx a.
- `theorem approx_symm : ∀ a b : Real, approx a b → approx b a := by sorry` states symmetry: if a approx b then b approx a.
- `theorem approx_trans : ∀ a b c : Real, approx a b → approx b c → approx a c := by sorry` states transitivity: if a approx b and b approx c, then a approx c.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The code defines precisely the intended relation and then states the three properties that constitute an equivalence relation. While it does not bundle them into a single `Equivalence` structure, proving these three lemmas is exactly what “prove it is an equivalence relation” amounts to in natural language.

3) Comparison with the original statement:
- Definition matches: a ≈ b iff a − b ∈ ℤ is captured by ∃ z : Int, a − b = (z : Real).
- Goal matches: theorems assert reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of ≈ on ℝ.
- No extraneous or vacuous placeholders are introduced; `approx` is a legitimate definition using Mathlib's `Real` and `Int`.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable {R : Type _} [Ring R]`: Let R be a ring.
- `variable (a b c : R)`: Let a, b, c be elements of R.
- `theorem my_mul_zero : a * 0 = 0 := by sorry`: States a * 0 = 0.
- `theorem my_zero_mul : (0 : R) * a = 0 := by sorry`: States 0 * a = 0.
- `theorem my_mul_neg : a * -b = -(a * b) := by sorry`: States a(-b) = -(ab).
- `theorem my_neg_mul : -a * b = -(a * b) := by sorry`: States (-a)b = -(ab).
- `theorem my_neg_mul_neg : (-a) * (-b) = a * b := by sorry`: States (-a)(-b) = ab.
- `theorem my_mul_sub : a * (b - c) = a * b - a * c := by sorry`: States a(b − c) = ab − ac.
- `theorem my_neg_one_mul : (-1 : R) * a = -a := by sorry`: States (−1)a = −a.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The original asks to prove, for a ring R and a,b,c in R:
- a·0 = 0 = 0·a. The code provides both a*0=0 and 0*a=0 as separate theorems.
- a(−b) = −(ab) = (−a)b. The code provides both equalities a(−b) = −(ab) and (−a)b = −(ab).
- (−a)(−b) = ab. Included exactly.
- a(b − c) = ab − ac. Included exactly.
- (−1)a = −a. Included exactly.
Thus, each listed property is captured, sometimes split into two separate theorems for chained equalities, which is faithful.

Step 3: Final check for faithfulness and red flags.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given with omitted proofs (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the instructions.
- The assumptions match: R is a ring, a,b,c ∈ R.
- The mathematical content aligns exactly with the original statements, with no unintended generalization or restriction.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the natural language statements.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Nat` just bring in standard Mathlib and natural number notations.
- Theorem `ZMod_unit_iff_gcd {n : Nat} (hn : 0 < n) (a : Nat) : IsUnit (a : ZMod n) ↔ Nat.gcd a n = 1` says: For a positive natural number n and any natural number a, the class of a in ZMod n is a unit if and only if gcd(a, n) = 1.
- Theorem `ZMod_units_eq {n : Nat} (hn : 0 < n) : {x : ZMod n | IsUnit x} = { x : ZMod n | ∃ a : Nat, x = (a : ZMod n) ∧ Nat.gcd a n = 1 }` says: For positive n, the set of units in ZMod n equals the set of residue classes x for which there exists a natural representative a with x = a mod n and gcd(a, n) = 1.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The first theorem matches exactly: it states the equivalence between being a unit in Z_n and gcd(a, n) = 1 for the congruence class [a]. The use of `a : Nat` is a harmless choice of representative; every class in ZMod n has a natural representative and the property gcd(a, n) = 1 is invariant under adding multiples of n, so it is well-defined on congruence classes.
- The second theorem matches the set-theoretic statement: the set of units in Z_n equals the set of classes [a] with gcd(a, n) = 1. The existential over `a : Nat` simply expresses the same set { [a] : gcd(a, n) = 1 } in Lean's way; since every x ∈ ZMod n has some natural representative, this is faithful.
- The hypothesis `0 < n` aligns with “Let n be a positive integer.”
- The code uses standard Mathlib notions (ZMod, IsUnit, Nat.gcd) and introduces no vacuous or placeholder definitions.

Step 3: Final comparison for differences.
- Potential subtlety: the natural language considers integers a; the code uses naturals a. This is not a substantive change because ZMod n elements have natural representatives and gcd(a, n) = 1 is preserved under changing representatives by n and under taking absolute value.
- The second statement uses a set of elements of ZMod n with IsUnit; this matches the phrasing “the set Z_n^× of units in Z_n equals ...”. No mismatch.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement, with appropriate positivity assumption and correct use of Mathlib primitives. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.

- `theorem srdoty_alg_Z_n_779 (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) (a b : Int) : Int.modeq a b n ↔ a % n = b % n := by sorry`
  This states: For integers n, a, b with n > 0, the congruence a ≡ b (mod n) is equivalent to the equality of their remainders upon division by n, i.e., a % n = b % n. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the statement is clear.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language:
- Natural language: Let n > 0 be an integer and a, b ∈ ℤ. Prove that a ≡ b (mod n) iff a and b have the same remainder on division by n.
- Lean: Assumes n : Int with 0 < n, and a, b : Int. It asserts `Int.modeq a b n ↔ a % n = b % n`.
- This matches exactly: `Int.modeq a b n` is the formal congruence modulo n, and `a % n = b % n` expresses that a and b have the same remainder upon division by the positive integer n. With hn : 0 < n, the `%` on Int corresponds to the usual Euclidean remainder in [0, n), so “same remainder” is precisely equality of `%` values.

3) Final check for differences:
- Quantifiers and hypotheses match: n > 0, a, b ∈ ℤ.
- Statement is an if and only if between modular congruence and equality of remainders.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement.
- No unwanted generalization/specialization.
- Potential naming subtlety (`Int.modeq` vs `Int.ModEq`) does not affect the audit since the premise says the code compiles; thus it denotes the intended congruence relation.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: Let n be an integer with 0 < n (i.e., a positive integer), and let a, b, c, d be integers. Assume n divides a−b and n divides c−d. Then n divides a c − b d. No auxiliary definitions; the theorem has no proof provided (which is fine for translation auditing).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The original statement: a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n) imply ac ≡ bd (mod n).
- In integers, a ≡ b (mod n) means n ∣ (a−b). Thus the Lean hypotheses `hab : n ∣ a - b` and `hcd : n ∣ c - d` match exactly.
- The conclusion ac ≡ bd (mod n) means n ∣ (ac − bd), which is exactly the theorem’s conclusion.
- The assumption `hn : 0 < n` matches “n is a fixed positive integer.” Using Int rather than Nat is fine; the positivity ensures it’s a positive integer.
- No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions of divisibility.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.

  Natural language: For any finite group G and natural number p, assuming p is prime, p ≠ 2 (so p is an odd prime), and |G| = 2p, then True holds. The proof is trivial.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement claims a classification: if |G| = 2p with p an odd prime, then G is isomorphic to either Z_{2p} or the dihedral group D_p. The Lean theorem does not assert any such classification; it concludes only `True`, which is a vacuous statement independent of the structure of G. There is no mention of isomorphisms, cyclic or dihedral groups, or any alternative. Hence, the code does not translate the intended statement.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are different. While the hypotheses on p and |G| match the setup of the original theorem, the conclusion in the Lean code is completely unrelated (vacuous) to the classification claim. There are no auxiliary definitions; the failure is that the final theorem is vacuous and does not state the intended result.

- `theorem finite_abelian_group_is_direct_product_of_cyclic (G : Type*) [AddCommGroup G] [Fintype G] :` introduces a finite abelian group G (additive notation and finite cardinality).
- `∃ (m : ℕ) (f : Fin m → ℕ), (∀ i, 0 < f i) ∧ Nonempty (G ≃+ ∀ i, ZMod (f i))` asserts there exists a natural number m and a function f assigning to each index i in `Fin m` a positive natural number, such that G is (additively) isomorphic to the finite product (Pi type) of cyclic groups `ZMod (f i)`.
- Using `∀ i, ZMod (f i)` expresses the finite direct product over `i : Fin m`. Since `Fin m` is finite, this is the usual finite direct product of cyclic groups. The positivity condition `0 < f i` avoids `ZMod 0` and allows `ZMod 1` (the trivial cyclic group), which is acceptable.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; only a theorem statement with `sorry` (proof omitted), which is allowed for translation auditing.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language has two statements:
  (a) Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups.
  (b) If `n = p1^{k1} ⋯ pr^{kr}`, then the number of isomorphism classes of finite abelian groups of order n is `p(k1) ⋯ p(kr)`.
- The Lean theorem precisely formalizes (a): existence of a decomposition as a finite product of cyclic groups `ZMod (f i)`. It does not enforce the canonical forms (prime-power cyclic factors or invariant factor divisibility), but the natural language sentence (a) does not require those constraints either, so this part matches well.
- The Lean code does not address (b) at all. There is no statement about counting isomorphism classes or partitions.

3) Final check:
- The Lean code captures only the first sentence of the natural language statement and omits the second counting result. Therefore, the translation is incomplete and not faithful to the full statement. There are no vacuous or fake definitions; the issue is omission of the second part.

  - Interpreted: For any additive subgroup `H` of the integers, there exists a natural number `n` such that `H` equals `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)`.
  - In Mathlib, `AddSubgroup.zmultiples a` is the additive subgroup generated by the element `a`, i.e., `{k • a | k : ℤ}`. Over `ℤ`, this is exactly `nℤ = {k * n | k : ℤ}`.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the subgroups of (ℤ,+) are exactly the subgroups nℤ for integers n.""
- Lean: Every additive subgroup `H` of `ℤ` is of the form `nℤ` for some `n : ℕ` (viewed as an integer via `(n : ℤ)`).
- The only apparent difference is allowing `n` to range over `ℕ` instead of all `ℤ`. This is a harmless specialization because for any integer `m`, the subgroup `mℤ` equals `|m|ℤ`, so using `n ∈ ℕ` classifies exactly the same subgroups. Moreover, `AddSubgroup.zmultiples (n : ℤ)` is by construction a subgroup, addressing the ""exactly"" part that those forms are indeed subgroups.
- No auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is a direct formalization of the classification claim. The use of `sorry` is acceptable for this auditing task as we only judge the statement, not the proof.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem faithfully states that each subgroup of `(ℤ, +)` is of the form `nℤ` (with `n ≥ 0`), which is mathematically equivalent to the natural statement allowing `n ∈ ℤ`. No meaningful discrepancy remains.

The proof is omitted (by sorry), but the statement is clear and standard: every finite simple abelian group is cyclic of prime order, hence isomorphic to Z/pZ.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the statement uses standard Mathlib structures and a standard notion of simplicity for abelian groups.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For a fixed prime p, the composition factors of any finite abelian p-group are all isomorphic to Z_p.
- The Lean theorem does not mention composition factors, composition series, or p-groups. It only classifies finite simple abelian groups as ZMod p for some prime p. It does not assert that the prime is the same as a given p, nor that all composition factors of a given p-group are Z_p. Thus it is a general lemma that could be used in a proof of the original statement but is not itself the same statement.
- Quantifier mismatch: The natural statement fixes a prime p and asserts all composition factors are isomorphic to Z_p; the Lean theorem asserts existence of a prime p (depending on A) for which a simple abelian group A is isomorphic to ZMod p.

3) Final check: The two statements are different. The Lean code is a related classification result, not a direct formalization of the claim about composition factors of finite abelian p-groups. Since the code neither mentions composition factors nor imposes the p-group hypothesis nor fixes the prime p, it is not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib and open Equiv: standard setup, gives access to permutations and group theory.
- def Partitions (n : ℕ) : Type := { l : List ℕ // l.sum = n ∧ ∀ a ∈ l, a > 0 }:
  This defines a type of lists of positive integers summing to n. This is actually the type of compositions of n (order matters), not the usual mathematical notion of partitions (orderless multisets of positive integers summing to n). The docstring calls it a naive representation of partitions, but as defined it treats different orderings as distinct, so it does not model partitions faithfully.
- theorem exists_cycle_type_classifying_conjugacy (n : ℕ) : ∃ (cycle_type : (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) → Partitions n), ∀ σ τ, IsConj σ τ ↔ cycle_type σ = cycle_type τ:
  This asserts existence of a function from S_n to the above Partitions n such that two permutations are conjugate iff they have equal images. This is intended to be the cycle-type classifier. Since the codomain is the list type, this can be made correct if the classifier returns a canonical (e.g., sorted) list of cycle lengths, so equality of lists matches equality of partitions. The statement is existential, so this is plausible. As a translation of the first sentence, this is essentially fine provided “Partitions n” truly models partitions; but here it does not by definition.
- theorem conjugacy_classes_equiv_partitions (n : ℕ) : ∃ (e : ConjClasses (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ≃ Partitions n), True:
  This claims there exists a bijection between conjugacy classes of S_n and the defined type Partitions n (lists of positive integers summing to n). The trailing “, True” is redundant. The intent is to say conjugacy classes are in bijection with partitions of n. However, since Partitions n here is actually compositions of n, this is not faithful: the number of compositions of n is 2^(n-1), which in general does not equal the number of partitions p(n). Thus, as stated, it asserts the wrong bijection.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language says: two permutations are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type; hence partitions of n label conjugacy classes; number of conjugacy classes equals number of partitions of n.
- The first Lean theorem could match the first sentence if the target really were partitions (up to order) or if the function outputs a canonical sorted list. However, the code’s Partitions n is not the correct mathematical partitions type; it is compositions. Although one could choose the classifier to land in a canonical subset (sorted lists), the codomain type itself does not enforce this, but the existential quantifier allows choosing such a function. So the first theorem can be seen as essentially faithful if we read “Partitions” as canonical lists; but strictly, the type is wrong.
- The second Lean theorem explicitly claims a bijection with the type of lists (compositions), which is not the same as partitions, so this does not faithfully translate the mathematical statement. Consequently, it also misrepresents the concluding statement about the number of conjugacy classes equaling the number of partitions.

Final check:
- The math problems are different because the Lean code’s Partitions n is compositions, not partitions. This leads to an incorrect target for the bijection in the second theorem. The first theorem might be salvaged by interpreting the existential choice to return sorted lists, but the codomain is still mislabeled. The second theorem is unfaithful.

Grade rationale:
- No vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definition is legitimate but incorrect for modeling partitions. One main theorem (bijection) is formulated against the wrong type, so the translation fails in an essential way.

  Natural language: For a natural number n with 3 ≤ n, for every permutation σ of Fin n, if σ composed with any permutation τ equals τ composed with σ (i.e., σ commutes with every τ in Sym n), then σ equals the identity permutation on Fin n.
  Notes:
  - `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` is the standard Mathlib encoding of the symmetric group on n letters.
  - `Equiv.refl (Fin n)` is the identity permutation.
  - `σ.trans τ = τ.trans σ` expresses that σ and τ commute under composition. Even if `trans` composes in a particular order, the equality written is symmetric and captures commutation with all τ.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For n ≥ 3, the center Z(Sym_n) is trivial. Equivalently, any element that commutes with all elements is the identity.
- The code states exactly that: under the hypothesis 3 ≤ n, if a permutation σ commutes with all τ ∈ Sym n, then σ is the identity. This is precisely the assertion that the center is trivial.

- Condition n ≥ 3 is present as `hn : 3 ≤ n` — matches exactly.
- Statement is expressed pointwise rather than in terms of the set-theoretic center, but logically equivalent.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `universe u`: Universe declaration; no mathematical content.
- `constant ZMod : Nat → Type u`: Introduces an opaque constant family of types indexed by `Nat`. This is a placeholder for Z/nZ but provides no structure or meaning; it is not Mathlib's actual `ZMod`.
- `class Field (α : Type u) : Prop`: Declares an empty class `Field`. There are no operations or axioms (no addition, multiplication, etc.). This is a vacuous placeholder, not Mathlib's `Field` typeclass.
- `namespace Nat ... end Nat` with `def Prime (n : Nat) : Prop := 1 < n`: Redefines `Nat.Prime` to mean merely `1 < n`. This is incorrect; primality is not the same as being greater than 1. This is a critical error because it changes the meaning of the theorem.
- The theorem:
  `/-- Let n be a positive integer. Then Z_n is a field iff n is prime. -/
  theorem zmod_field_iff_prime (n : Nat) (hn : 1 < n) : Field (ZMod n) ↔ Nat.Prime n := by sorry`
  Given the above definitions, this states: assuming `1 < n`, `Field (ZMod n) ↔ (1 < n)`. Since `hn : 1 < n` is a hypothesis, the right-hand side is essentially true under the context, so the statement reduces to `Field (ZMod n) ↔ True` in the presence of `hn`. Moreover, since `Field` is an empty class, `Field (ZMod n)` is just an arbitrary Prop with no content and no relation to actual field structure. The proof is `sorry`, but our task is about the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The intended statement: For positive integer n, Z_n is a field iff n is prime.
- Discrepancies:
  1) Prime is incorrectly defined as `1 < n` rather than true primality. This fundamentally changes the right side of the equivalence.
  2) `ZMod` is an opaque constant, not the actual quotient ring Z/nZ.
  3) `Field` is a vacuous class with no structure.
  4) The hypothesis `hn : 1 < n` is stronger than merely “positive integer” (often means `0 < n`), though this alone would be a minor issue if the rest were correct. However, combined with the redefinition of `Prime`, it trivializes the right side.

Final check: The Lean code does not faithfully translate the original statement. It uses vacuous placeholders and an incorrect definition of prime. Even if the placeholders were replaced by real Mathlib definitions, the redefinition of `Nat.Prime` would still make the theorem incorrect. Therefore, it fails the faithfulness check.

  - `p : ℕ` with `hp : p.Prime`: p is a fixed prime number.
  - Hypothesis `h : ∀ g : G, ∃ k : ℕ, orderOf g = p ^ k`: Every element of G has order equal to a power of p.
  - Hypothesis `hne : Fintype.card G > 1`: The cardinality of G is greater than 1 (G is nontrivial).
  - Conclusion: `∃ r : ℕ, Fintype.card G = p ^ r`: There exists a natural number r such that |G| = p^r.
  - The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable for auditing the statement.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: If G is finite and every element has order a p-power (for fixed prime p), then |G| = p^r for some integer r ≥ 1.
- Code assumptions match the setup: finite group, fixed prime p, element orders are p-powers.
- Differences:
  - The code adds an extra hypothesis `|G| > 1` (nontrivial), which the natural statement does not list as a hypothesis. However, the natural statement requires r ≥ 1 in the conclusion, which implies |G| ≥ p ≥ 2, hence |G| > 1. So adding `|G| > 1` as a hypothesis is consistent with the intended conclusion and is a harmless strengthening of assumptions.
  - The code’s conclusion does not explicitly include `r ≥ 1`; it only states `∃ r : ℕ, |G| = p^r`. Given the hypothesis `|G| > 1` and `p.Prime`, this implicitly forces r ≥ 1 (since r = 0 would give |G| = 1). So while not stated, it is logically implied by the code’s hypotheses.

3) Final check:
- Mathematically, the code’s theorem is essentially equivalent to the natural language statement: the added nontriviality assumption and the omitted explicit `r ≥ 1` are two sides of the same coin under `p.Prime`. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem states the correct mathematical content.
- Minor discrepancy: the conclusion does not state `r ≥ 1` explicitly, and the nontriviality is assumed rather than deduced. This is a slight difference in presentation, not substance.

Overall, the translation is faithful up to a minor presentational shift. Hence it passes, with a small deduction for not expressing `r ≥ 1` explicitly.

The Lean theorem only asserts the existence of some pair σ, τ that generate the whole group, with no specification that σ is the transposition (1 2) and τ is the n-cycle (1 2 ... n). Thus, it is a strictly weaker claim and does not pin down the specific generators desired.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Original: Concrete generating set S = {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)} generates Sym_n. This is a specific equality of subgroups using designated elements.
- Lean: There exist some σ, τ whose closure is the whole group. No requirement that σ = (1,2) or τ is the n-cycle. 
Therefore the formalization is not faithful to the specific statement. 

Other checks:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there is only a theorem statement. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions. The group Sym_n is correctly modeled as Equiv.Perm (Fin n), and “generated by” is Subgroup.closure equaling ⊤, which is the correct Mathlib notion. The only issue is the existential quantification instead of asserting the generation by the particular set S.

Grade rationale: The code is on-topic and uses the correct objects, but it changes the statement from a specific generating set to an existence of some generating pair. This is a significant weakening, so it is not faithful, though not unrelated. A grade of 7 reflects this.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `def H ... : Set (Units (Matrix ... F)) := {A | A ∈ G ∧ (Matrix.det A.val = (1 : F) ∨ Matrix.det A.val = -1)}`
  This defines the set H of invertible n×n matrices over F (modeled as `Units (Matrix ...)`) that lie in the subgroup G and have determinant equal to 1 or −1. This matches the intended set H = {A ∈ G | det A = ±1}.

- `theorem H_is_subgroup ... : Subgroup (Units (Matrix ... F)) := by sorry`
  This claims to produce a subgroup of the group of units (i.e., of GL_n(F)), but it does not mention H at all. It neither asserts that the subgroup has carrier equal to the set H, nor that it is a subgroup of G, nor does it even reference H in any way. It is just an assertion that some subgroup of `Units (Matrix ... F)` exists (which is trivially true e.g. by taking the trivial subgroup), and hence is unrelated to the specific H. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable if the statement were correct, but here the statement itself is not the right one.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Let F be a field, G ≤ GL_n(F), define H = {A ∈ G | det A = ±1}. Prove that H is a subgroup of G.
- Lean code: Correctly defines the set H. However, the theorem does not assert that H is a subgroup (neither of GL_n(F) nor of G). It merely states a bare `Subgroup (Units ...)`, without tying it to H. Therefore, the code does not faithfully express the intended theorem.

Step 3: Final check for equivalence.
- Differences:
  - The theorem should state (or construct) a `Subgroup (Units ...)` whose carrier is exactly the set `H F n G`, or equivalently give a structure `Subgroup (Units ...)` with `carrier = {A | A ∈ G ∧ det A = ±1}`. It should also ideally note that this subgroup is contained in G (i.e., H ≤ G). The current theorem does neither.
  - Thus, the key property “H is a subgroup” is not encoded; the theorem is unrelated to H and does not establish that H is a subgroup of G.

Conclusion: The definition of H is faithful, but the theorem statement is not, so the overall translation fails.

- `theorem matrix_group_contains_one {α : Type _} [Group α] {G : Set α} ... : (1 : α) ∈ G := by sorry`: In an arbitrary group α, if G is nonempty (`G.Nonempty`), closed under multiplication (`∀ a b, a ∈ G → b ∈ G → a * b ∈ G`), and closed under inverses (`∀ a, a ∈ G → a⁻¹ ∈ G`), then the identity `1` belongs to G. Proof omitted with `sorry` (allowed for this task).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: Let G ⊆ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) be nonempty, closed under products and inverses. Prove I ∈ G.
- The Lean theorem is a slight generalization: it asserts the same property in any group (α) rather than specifically in the full ring of matrices. This generalization is standard and faithful: the argument only uses the group axioms, which are implicitly satisfied by the subset of invertible matrices under multiplication. Any “matrix group” as described (nonempty and closed under products and inverses) consists of invertible matrices, so the statement applies.

3) Final check and differences:
- Difference: The Lean code assumes the ambient structure is a group [Group α], whereas Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) is not a group under multiplication. However, the original hypothesis that G is closed under inverses implies all elements of G are invertible, so G sits inside the group of invertible matrices, and the group-form statement applies. This is a benign generalization, not a mismatch.
- No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a (permitted) `sorry` proof.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful and slightly more general formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the math library.
- `def ElementaryMatrix {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] (M : Matrix n n ℝ) : Prop := True`:
  This defines a predicate `ElementaryMatrix` on real n×n matrices to be identically True. In words: every matrix is deemed an ""elementary matrix."" This is explicitly a placeholder and vacuous.
- `theorem matrix_nonsingular_is_product_of_elementary_matrices {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] (A : Matrix n n ℝ) (h : IsUnit A) : ∃ L : List (Matrix n n ℝ), List.foldl (· * ·) (1 : Matrix n n ℝ) L = A ∧ ∀ M ∈ L, ElementaryMatrix M := by sorry`:
  For any finite index type `n`, any real `n×n` matrix `A`, and assuming `A` is a unit (invertible/nonsingular), there exists a list `L` of matrices whose left-folded product (with multiplication) equals `A`, and every element of `L` satisfies `ElementaryMatrix`.
  Since `ElementaryMatrix` is defined as `True`, the condition `∀ M ∈ L, ElementaryMatrix M` imposes no restriction. Thus the statement effectively reduces to: for any matrix `A` (even ignoring `IsUnit A`), there exists a list of matrices whose product is `A`. This is trivially satisfied by taking `L = [A]`. The nonsingularity hypothesis is irrelevant in this encoded statement.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Any nonsingular n×n real matrix A can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices."" This requires that each factor in the product is an elementary matrix (in the standard sense: corresponding to a single elementary row operation), and it crucially uses nonsingularity.
- Lean code: Uses a vacuous placeholder `ElementaryMatrix := True`, so the requirement that factors be elementary is not actually enforced. The hypothesis `IsUnit A` (nonsingular) is present but not needed to achieve the trivial conclusion.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is much weaker than the intended theorem and not faithful. Additionally, the presence of a vacuous auxiliary definition violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be faithful, not placeholders.

Final check:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code does not capture the essential content (product of true elementary matrices) and includes a vacuous definition. If `ElementaryMatrix` were properly defined, the theorem statement would be a reasonable formalization, but as written it fails.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def SL (n : Nat) := { A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ // Matrix.det A = 1 }`
  This defines SL(n, ℝ) as the subtype of n×n real matrices whose determinant equals 1. That matches the set `{A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A = 1}` in the natural language statement.

- `instance SL_group (n : Nat) : Group (SL n) := by sorry`
  This declares that `SL n` carries a group structure. In Lean, providing a `Group` instance means specifying the multiplication, identity, and inverse operations (plus the axioms). Although the proof/implementation is omitted with `sorry`, the statement being asserted is precisely that this set forms a group. The accompanying docstring says “under matrix multiplication,” which aligns with the intended meaning; in such an instance, the multiplication and inverses would be the restriction of matrix multiplication and matrix inverse to the subtype `det = 1`.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement is: show that the set of n×n real matrices with determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication. The Lean code defines exactly this set and asserts it has a `Group` structure. While the explicit mention of “under matrix multiplication” is not encoded in the type of the instance, in Lean the `Group` instance on a subtype of matrices is intended to be (and would be) given by restricting the existing matrix multiplication, identity, and inverse to the subtype. The docstring explicitly states this.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions: `SL` is a precise subtype; `Group` is Mathlib’s standard typeclass. The `sorry` is only in the proof of the instance, which is allowed per the auditing guidelines; the key is that the declared statement matches the natural language claim.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same: both assert that the set `{A | det A = 1}` of real n×n matrices forms a group (with respect to matrix multiplication). No extra restrictions (like n ≥ 1) are added; the code uses `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ`, which is the standard formalization of n×n real matrices. Thus the translation is faithful.

- `variable (H K : Subgroup G)` introduces two subgroups H and K of G.
- `variable (m n : Nat) [Fintype H] [Fintype K]` introduces natural numbers m, n and assumes H and K are finite (Fintype instances).

- `variable (hg : Nat.gcd m n = 1)` assumes gcd(m, n) = 1.
- `theorem subgroups_inter_trivial : (H ⊓ K : Subgroup G) = (⊥ : Subgroup G)` states the conclusion that the intersection (the infimum ⊓ of subgroups, which is their set-theoretic intersection) equals the bottom subgroup ⊥ (the trivial subgroup {1}). The theorem is implicitly universally quantified over all the previously introduced parameters and hypotheses.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For finite subgroups H and K of a group G with |H| = m and |K| = n, if gcd(m, n) = 1, then H ∩ K = {1}.
- The Lean code precisely matches this: it assumes H and K are subgroups of G with Fintype instances, records that their sizes are m and n, assumes gcd(m, n) = 1, and concludes (H ⊓ K) = ⊥, which is exactly H ∩ K = {1}.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are made. The use of implicit parameters for the hypotheses is standard in Lean and means the theorem is stated under those assumptions.

Final check: The two statements are the same in mathematical meaning. No discrepancies or extra/missing conditions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_primitive_root_iff {n : ℕ} :` We fix a natural number n (including possibly 0) and state an equivalence.
- `IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ)` This means the unit group of the ring ZMod n (integers modulo n) is cyclic; equivalently, there exists a generator (a “primitive root” in this context).
- `↔ n = 2 ∨ n = 4 ∨ ∃ (p t : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ p ≠ 2 ∧ (n = p ^ t ∨ n = 2 * p ^ t)` The group is cyclic if and only if either n = 2, or n = 4, or there exist natural numbers p and t such that p is a prime different from 2 (i.e., p is odd) and n equals p^t or 2 * p^t.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “There is a primitive root in Z_n^× iff n = 2, 4, p^t, or 2 p^t, where p is an odd prime.” Interpreting “there is a primitive root” as “(Z/nZ)^× is cyclic” is standard and matches `IsCyclic ((ZMod n)ˣ)`.
- The condition “p is an odd prime” matches `p.Prime ∧ p ≠ 2` in Lean.
- The classification cases 2, 4, p^t, 2 p^t match the disjunction on the right.

3) Differences / potential issues:
- The code allows t = 0 (since t : ℕ), so the case n = p^t includes n = 1. The natural language statement did not list n = 1. In many texts, n = 1 is either excluded by convention or included; here it’s omitted. So the code’s RHS implicitly includes n = 1 (take p = 3, t = 0), which is a slight generalization of the natural statement.
- The code quantifies over all n : ℕ, including n = 0. The standard number-theoretic statement is about n ≥ 1 (since Z_n typically denotes integers modulo a positive n). For n = 0, ZMod 0 is isomorphic to ℤ and ((ZMod 0)ˣ) is {±1}, which is cyclic, while the RHS classification does not include n = 0. Thus, as stated, the Lean equivalence claims a classification for all n, not just n ≥ 1. This is a mismatch in domain. The natural language statement implicitly assumes n ≥ 1.
- Aside from these domain/parameter subtleties, the formal content (cyclicity ⇔ the listed shapes of n with p odd) matches.

Final check: The mathematical meanings are almost the same: “primitive root exists” ⇔ “unit group is cyclic” with the classical list of n. Differences are (i) omission vs implicit inclusion of n = 1 due to allowing t = 0, and (ii) no explicit restriction to n ≥ 1 in the Lean statement (so it includes n = 0). These are small but real discrepancies. No vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the code directly states the theorem.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let `G` be a group of order `p^r` with `p` prime and `r ≥ 1`. Prove that `|Z(G)| = p^k` for some integer `k ≥ 1`.
- Lean: Exactly the same content: finite group `G` with `|G| = p^r`, `p` prime, `r ≥ 1`, and then `|Z(G)| = p^k` with `k ≥ 1`. The center is represented as `MulCenter G`, and its size by `Fintype.card (MulCenter G)`.

Checks for issues:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. All terms (`Group`, `Fintype`, `MulCenter`, `Nat.Prime`) are standard Mathlib constructs.
- The extra assumption `[Fintype (MulCenter G)]` is redundant but consistent with the setting and does not change the meaning.

There is no assertion that U is an elementary matrix, let alone of the same type as the row operation; and `mat_mul` is not the real matrix multiplication.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: For any positive integer n, for n×n matrices A and B where B is obtained from A by a single elementary row operation, there exists an elementary n×n matrix U of the corresponding type such that B = U A (usual matrix multiplication).
- Discrepancies:
  - n is not restricted to be positive in the code.
  - `ElemRowOp` is an uninterpreted constant, not actually defined as “single elementary row operation.”
  - `mat_mul` is an uninterpreted operation, not the standard matrix multiplication.
  - The theorem does not state that U is an elementary matrix, nor that it is of the same type as the row operation. This is a central part of the natural language statement and is completely missing.
  - The code does not use Mathlib’s matrix type or its existing notions of elementary matrices/row operations.

Final check:
- The formal statement is substantially weaker and largely unrelated because it uses arbitrary placeholders for both the row-operation relation and multiplication, and omits the crucial property that U is an elementary matrix of the corresponding type. Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- Multiple critical omissions and placeholder (uninterpreted) constants. Even replacing the placeholders with real definitions would still leave the theorem missing the requirement that U is an elementary matrix of the same type. Hence a low score is appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem srdoty_alg_Sylow_777 states: For a natural number n with 6 ≤ n, let N be a subgroup of Perm (Fin n). Assume N ≠ ⊤ (i.e., N is not the whole symmetric group on n letters) and N is normal (hNnormal : IsNormal N) in the ambient group (Perm (Fin n)). Then, for every i : Fin n and every permutation σ : Perm (Fin n), if σ belongs to AlternatingGroup (Fin n) (i.e., σ ∈ A_n) and σ fixes i (σ i = i), then σ ∈ N.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let n ≥ 6 and let N be a proper normal subgroup of A_n. Show that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, N contains G_i = {σ ∈ A_n : σ(i) = i}. Equivalently, for all i and all σ ∈ A_n fixing i, we have σ ∈ N, under the assumptions that N ≤ A_n, N ⊲ A_n, and N ≠ A_n.
- Lean code conclusion matches the target inclusion form: it asserts that every even permutation fixing i lies in N, i.e., G_i ≤ N. The indexing i : Fin n instead of 1..n is a standard formalization choice and fine.
- However, the hypotheses differ significantly:
  • The code does not assume N ≤ A_n (N is just a subgroup of S_n).
  • The code’s normality assumption IsNormal N is normality in S_n, not normality inside A_n. This is strictly stronger than needed, but still a change.
  • The code’s “proper” assumption is N ≠ ⊤ (i.e., N ≠ S_n), whereas the natural statement requires N ≠ A_n (proper as a subgroup of A_n). The code allows N = A_n, which would violate the “proper in A_n” requirement in the original statement.

3) Final check:
- Are the problems the same? No. The code proves a different statement: it applies to subgroups N of S_n that are normal in S_n and merely not equal to S_n, without any requirement that N ⊆ A_n or that N ≠ A_n. The original requires N to be a proper normal subgroup of A_n (i.e., N ≤ A_n, N ≠ A_n, and normality relative to A_n). While the conclusion about containing G_i is the same, the hypotheses are not faithfully translated. This is more than a slight specialization, since key structural conditions (N ⊆ A_n and properness relative to A_n) are missing.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

# Field iff every nonzero element is a unit

For a ring R, R is a field iff every nonzero element of R is a unit.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem field_iff_units_eq_nonzero {R : Type _} : Field R ↔ (∀ x : R, x ≠ 0 ↔ IsUnit x) := by sorry`
  Natural language reading: For a type R, R is a field if and only if every element x of R is nonzero exactly when x is a unit. In other words, “Field R” is equivalent to the predicate that for all x, x ≠ 0 ↔ IsUnit x.

2) Does this match the original statement?
- The original statement: “Prove that a commutative ring R is a field if and only if R^{×} = R\setminus\{0\}.” This means: For a commutative ring structure on R (fixed), R is a field iff the set of units equals the set of nonzero elements, equivalently ∀ x, x ≠ 0 ↔ IsUnit x.
- The Lean statement uses `Field R` directly (a typeclass asserting that R has a field structure) rather than the Prop `IsField R` for a given commutative ring structure. It also omits any assumption like `[CommRing R]` that would fix the base ring structure on R. In mathlib, the more faithful formalization would be something like `theorem ... [CommRing R] : IsField R ↔ ∀ x : R, x ≠ 0 ↔ IsUnit x`.
- Moreover, as written, the RHS mentions `0` and `IsUnit` without supplying the necessary typeclass instances (Zero/One/Monoid), which in Lean typically come from having a ring (or at least a monoid with zero) structure in context. Relying on `Field R` on the LHS to supply instances does not work inside an `↔` without making those instances part of the ambient context. So, even ignoring proof, the statement as a formal proposition is not correctly scoped and does not faithfully reflect “for a given commutative ring R”.
- Content-wise, `∀ x, x ≠ 0 ↔ IsUnit x` does capture the equality of sets R× = R \ {0}. But the missing ring structure assumption and the use of `Field R` (a typeclass instance) instead of the Prop `IsField R` tied to an existing commutative ring structure are significant mismatches with the natural language statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different in important ways:
  - The natural statement fixes a commutative ring structure and asserts an equivalence about that ring (Prop `IsField R`).
  - The Lean statement asserts an equivalence with `Field R` (a typeclass instance) and lacks `[CommRing R]` (or any structure) in context, making the RHS ill-posed without instances. Thus it does not faithfully encode the intended proposition.
- The part equating units with nonzero elements is correct in spirit, but the overall formalization misses key structural hypotheses and uses the wrong notion of “R is a field” for this context.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]`: We fix a finite group G. (Finiteness is declared but not actually used later.)
- `variable (S : Type*) (conj : G -> S -> S)`: We introduce an abstract set S with an action `conj` of G on S (intended to model conjugation on subgroups).
- `variable (IsSylow : ℕ -> S -> Prop)`: We introduce an abstract predicate saying an element of S is “Sylow p” (no concrete link to Mathlib’s Sylow, just a parameter).
- `def IsNormal' (P : S) : Prop := ∀ g : G, conj g P = P`: Define “normality” for elements of S as being fixed by all conjugations. If S were `Subgroup G` and `conj` were subgroup conjugation, this is exactly normality.
- `theorem unique_sylow_normal {p : ℕ} (P : S) (hP : IsSylow p P) (huniq : ∀ Q, IsSylow p Q -> Q = P) (hconj : ∀ g (H : S), IsSylow p H -> IsSylow p (conj g H)) : IsNormal' S conj P := by sorry`
  Meaning: For a given natural number p and element P of S such that P is IsSylow p, if every IsSylow p element Q equals P (uniqueness), and if the property of being IsSylow p is preserved under the action `conj` by any g ∈ G, then P is fixed by all conjugations, i.e., P is normal in this abstract sense.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: For a finite group G and a prime p, if G has exactly one Sylow p-subgroup, then that Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G.
- The Lean code abstracts the situation: it does not explicitly use subgroups, normal subgroups, or Mathlib’s Sylow theory. Instead, it sets up a general schema: a G-action on a type S, a predicate IsSylow, and shows that uniqueness plus conjugation-stability implies invariance (= normality in this context).
- This is a standard general lemma capturing the usual argument: conjugates of a Sylow p-subgroup are Sylow; if uniqueness holds, the subgroup is fixed by conjugation and thus normal. The code’s `hconj` encodes “conjugates of Sylow are Sylow”; `huniq` encodes uniqueness; `IsNormal'` encodes normality.
- Differences:
  - The code does not assert p is prime or G is finite in the theorem statement; it abstracts away those facts and takes “conjugation preserves sylowness” as a hypothesis `hconj` instead. This is a generalization, not a contradiction.
  - It does not use Mathlib’s concrete `Subgroup G`, `Sylow p G`, or `Subgroup.Normal`; instead it uses an abstract type S and a custom `IsNormal'`. However, the abstraction is faithful: instantiating S := Subgroup G, conj := subgroup conjugation, and IsSylow := “is a Sylow p-subgroup” yields the original statement.
  - There are no vacuous or fake definitions (nothing is set to `True` or `none`). The auxiliary definition `IsNormal'` is legitimate and matches the intended concept under the standard instantiation.

Final comparison:
- The code presents a clean general lemma that exactly captures the reasoning behind the natural language statement. While it is more abstract and does not explicitly use Mathlib’s Sylow definitions, it is a faithful generalization of the original statement’s content, and can be instantiated to obtain the precise claim.
- Minor deductions could be made for not using Mathlib’s Sylow/normal subgroup notions directly and for omitting the “p is prime”/finiteness assumptions (handled implicitly by `hconj`). But per the guideline allowing slight generalizations, this is acceptable.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem states: For any type R, there exists a ring structure on R if and only if there exists an additive commutative group structure on R, and there exists a monoid structure on R, and the left and right distributive laws hold: ∀ a b c, a * (b + c) = a*b + a*c and ∀ a b c, (a + b) * c = a*c + b*c.
- Formally: Nonempty (Ring R) ↔ (Nonempty (AddCommGroup R) ∧ Nonempty (Monoid R) ∧ left distributivity ∧ right distributivity).

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement fixes a set R with two specified binary operations + and · and asks to show: R is a ring (with respect to those operations) if and only if (R, +) is an abelian group with identity 0, (R, ·) is a monoid with identity 1, and both distributive laws hold for those same fixed operations.
- The Lean statement, however, quantifies “there exists a ring structure” and “there exists an AddCommGroup structure” and “there exists a Monoid structure,” but it does not tie the distributivity equalities to the operations coming from those structures. In the code, the formulas a * (b + c) = ... and (a + b) * c = ... use the notations + and * which require instances [Add R] and [Mul R] to be in scope, but the theorem only provides Nonempty (AddCommGroup R) and Nonempty (Monoid R), i.e., existence of such instances, not usable instances. There is no guarantee (or even a reference) that the + and * in the distributivity clauses are the same as those from the provided structures. Moreover, the statement uses existential quantification on structures instead of asserting the equivalence for a fixed pair of operations + and ·.
- A faithful formalization should either:
  - Assume fixed operations via typeclasses [Add R] [Mul R] [Zero R] [One R] [Neg R], and then prove (Ring R) ↔ (AddCommGroup R ∧ Monoid R ∧ distributivity), or
  - Package the operations explicitly and quantify over them uniformly so that the same operations are used on both sides.
- As written, the existence of structures is not linked to the operations used in the distributive laws, and the theorem does not state the equivalence for a fixed pair of operations, but rather an existence equivalence, which is weaker and not the same as the intended statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Differences:
  - The natural statement is about fixed given operations + and · on R; the Lean statement is about the existence of some structures on R (potentially unrelated to any fixed operations).
  - The distributivity clauses in Lean are not tied to the structures appearing in the Nonempty statements; thus they may be ill-specified or refer to absent instances.
- Similarities:
  - The components (AddCommGroup, Monoid, left and right distributivity) match the usual axioms of a ring.
- Conclusion: Not faithful. The core mismatch is the failure to fix and align the operations across the equivalence and the use of existential quantification rather than an iff for given operations.

Grade rationale: The code captures the right ingredients (AddCommGroup, Monoid, distributivity) but does so in a way that does not faithfully reflect the intended “with two fixed operations” statement and fails to tie the operations together. Hence not faithful; significant but not entirely unrelated — grade 7.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Docstring: States the informal goal: given G, H matrix groups (subgroups of the units of n×n matrices), show there exists a subgroup whose underlying set is G ∩ H — i.e., the intersection is a matrix group.
- `variable {R : Type _} [Semiring R] {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We work over an arbitrary semiring R and an index type n that is finite and decidable; matrices are `Matrix n n R`.
- The theorem `matrix_groups_intersection_exists (G H : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R))) : ∃ K : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)), (K : Set (Units (Matrix n n R))) = (G : Set (Units (Matrix n n R))) ∩ (H : Set (Units (Matrix n n R)))`: For any two subgroups G and H of the group of units of n×n matrices over R, there exists a subgroup K whose carrier set equals the set-theoretic intersection of the carriers of G and H. The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- Natural language: Let G, H ⊂ GL(n) be matrix groups (subgroups). Prove that G ∩ H is a matrix group.
- Formalization: GL(n) is modeled as `Units (Matrix n n R)`. A “matrix group” is a `Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R))`. The statement asserts existence of a subgroup whose underlying set is exactly `G ∩ H`. That is precisely the assertion that the intersection of two matrix groups is again a matrix group (i.e., closed under the group operations and thus carries a subgroup structure).

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- The code is slightly more general: it works over an arbitrary semiring R and uses a finite index type n rather than a natural number dimension; this is a standard and acceptable generalization in Mathlib.
- The theorem is stated as existence of a subgroup with carrier equal to the intersection, which is equivalent to saying the intersection is a matrix group.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions (`Subgroup`, `Units`, `Matrix`).
- Thus the formal statement faithfully captures the original claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Bring in Mathlib and open the Matrix namespace for notation like matrix multiplication and transpose.
- `def GL (n : Nat) : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := {A | ∃ (B : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ), A ⬝ B = 1 ∧ B ⬝ A = 1}`: Defines GL(n) as the set of real n×n matrices A that admit a two-sided inverse B (so AB = I and BA = I). This is the standard definition of the general linear group.
- `def O (n : Nat) : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := {A | ∃ (B : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ), A ⬝ B = 1 ∧ B ⬝ A = 1 ∧ A ⬝ A.transpose = 1}`: Defines O(n) as the set of real n×n matrices that are invertible (same condition as in GL) and satisfy A Aᵀ = I.
- `theorem O_eq_GL (n : Nat) : O n = {A | A ∈ GL n ∧ A ⬝ A.transpose = 1} := by sorry`: States exactly the desired equality: O(n) equals the set of matrices that lie in GL(n) and satisfy A Aᵀ = I. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement is: Prove that O(n) = {A in GL(n) : A A^T = I}.
The Lean code defines O(n) by explicitly including the GL(n) condition (existence of a two-sided inverse) along with the orthogonality condition A Aᵀ = I, and then states the theorem asserting the equality O n = {A | A ∈ GL n ∧ A Aᵀ = I}. This matches the statement exactly.

Step 3: Final comparison and potential discrepancies.
- Field: The Lean code works over ℝ, which is the standard setting for O(n). The natural statement did not specify the field, but O(n) typically means over ℝ; this is an acceptable specialization.
- Form of orthogonality: Uses A Aᵀ = I (as in the natural statement) rather than Aᵀ A = I; both are equivalent under invertibility, and the code matches the natural phrasing.
- Indexing and identities: Uses matrices indexed by Fin n and the identity `1`, which are standard formalizations.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: Both GL and O are defined meaningfully; no cheating.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code to natural language.
- The theorem states: For any type F, there exist two binary operations add and mul on F, and elements zero and one in F, such that:
  - add is associative: add a (add b c) = add (add a b) c.
  - add is commutative: add a b = add b a.
  - zero is a right identity for add: add a zero = a. (By commutativity this implies zero is a two-sided identity.)
  - Every element has an additive inverse (two-sided, explicitly): ∀ a, ∃ b, add a b = zero ∧ add b a = zero.
  - mul is associative: mul a (mul b c) = mul (mul a b) c.
  - mul is commutative: mul a b = mul b a.
  - one is a right identity for mul: mul a one = a. (By commutativity this implies it's two-sided.)
  - For any a ≠ zero, there exists b with both left and right multiplicative inverse equalities: mul b a = one ∧ mul a b = one.
  - Left distributivity: mul a (add b c) = add (mul a b) (mul a c).
  - one ≠ zero.
- The theorem is an existential assertion: for every F, there exist such operations and constants satisfying these axioms.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: Given a set F equipped with two binary operations + and ·, show that “F is a field” if and only if the following hold: (1) (F, +) is an abelian group with identity 0; (2) (F \ {0}, ·) is an abelian group with identity 1; (3) 1 ≠ 0; (4) a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c in F.
- Key logical form: an iff (equivalence) between “F is a field” and the list of axioms, with the operations fixed in advance.
- The Lean code instead asserts: For any type F, there exist operations and constants satisfying those axioms. It does not speak about given operations, nor about “field” as a concept, nor provide an iff; it's a pure existence claim of a field structure on every type F.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness and any other discrepancies.
- Major mismatch: The original is an equivalence about a given pair of operations on F; the code is a universal existence claim for any F. These are entirely different statements.
- Missing “iff”: The code does not present equivalence. It also does not tie to Mathlib’s Field typeclass or a definition of field; it just lists axioms existentially.
- While the listed axioms roughly encode the usual field axioms (with some slight formal differences like only right identities, but commutativity makes them two-sided), the quantifier structure is completely wrong for the original statement.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

However, this definition is given as `by sorry` (a placeholder) and does not mention `Dn` at all, so it does not actually build the subgroup with carrier `Dn`.

2) Faithfulness to the statement:
- The natural language statement asks to show that D(n) (diagonal elements of GL(n)) is a matrix group, i.e., a subgroup of GL(n). A faithful formalization would either define a `Subgroup` whose carrier is exactly `Dn` or prove a theorem that `IsClosed under group operations` or equivalently provide `Subgroup` data using `Dn`.
- The code defines the set `Dn` correctly. However, the final line fails to connect the subgroup structure to `Dn`: it produces a bare `Subgroup (Units ...)` via `sorry` and does not specify that its carrier is `Dn`. Moreover, the use of `sorry` makes it a vacuous placeholder rather than a legitimate construction.

3) Final check and differences:
- The main discrepancy: the code does not establish that `Dn` is a subgroup; it merely claims (with a placeholder) the existence of some subgroup of `Units (Matrix ...)`, which is unrelated to `Dn`. This is not faithful to “Show that D(n) is a matrix group”.
- On the positive side, `is_diagonal` and `Dn` are legitimate and standard. The context over a commutative ring is a harmless generalization.
- However, due to the vacuous `sorry` and the lack of any tie between `Dn_is_subgroup` and `Dn`, the translation fails by the given guidelines.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the `sorry` were replaced by a proper construction of a `Subgroup` with carrier `Dn` and proofs of closure under multiplication and inverses, it would be faithful. As is, it fails.

- Original statement: Define E_{ij}(t) as the elementary matrix obtained from the identity by adding t times row j to row i, and prove E_{ij}(t) ∈ SL(n).
- The Lean definition of E matches the usual elementary row-add matrix: it is the identity with an extra t in the (i,j)-entry (for i ≠ j). The theorem asserts det(E) = 1 for i ≠ j. In mathlib, SL(n, ℝ) (SpecialLinearGroup (Fin n) ℝ) is defined as the subtype of matrices with determinant 1. Therefore, showing det(E) = 1 is exactly the condition for E to lie in SL(n, ℝ). Thus the content matches the mathematical meaning of the natural language statement.

- The Lean theorem stops at det(E) = 1 and does not explicitly package E into an element of SpecialLinearGroup (i.e., it does not produce ⟨E i j t, by ...⟩ : SpecialLinearGroup (Fin n) ℝ). However, since SL(n) in mathlib is defined by det = 1, the result directly implies membership. This is a very minor presentation difference, not a change in mathematical content.
- Indices: The natural language uses 1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n; Lean uses i j : Fin n with hypothesis i ≠ j. These are equivalent indexings (1-based vs 0-based) and the hypothesis i ≠ j is present, so no substantive difference.
- The domain of t is ℝ in both.
- The definition E is sensible for all i,j; when i = j it is the identity, but the theorem assumes i ≠ j, matching the statement.

Conclusion: The code faithfully translates the statement up to the minor point that it states det(E) = 1 rather than explicitly “E ∈ SL(n)”, though this is equivalent in mathlib.

- `def E (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`: Defines a 2×2 matrix over F, indexed by Fin 2, with entries given by pattern matching:

  - at (0,1) the entry is t,
  - at (1,0) the entry is 0,

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For a field F and E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]], show E(s)E(t) = E(s + t) for all s, t in F. The Lean code defines exactly that matrix E(t) and states precisely the desired equality. The indexing via `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F` is the standard formalization of 2×2 matrices in Lean. No extraneous or vacuous definitions are introduced.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. The Lean theorem matches the statement quantifiers and the matrix definition exactly. No discrepancies.

There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the proof is omitted (by sorry), which is acceptable for assessing translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement is: the product of any two reflections in O(2) is a rotation matrix (an element of SO(2)). In matrix terms over ℝ, a reflection is an orthogonal matrix with determinant −1, and a rotation is an orthogonal matrix with determinant +1. The Lean statement precisely assumes A,B are 2×2 real matrices with AᵀA = I, det A = −1 and BᵀB = I, det B = −1, and concludes (AB)ᵀ(AB) = I and det(AB) = 1. This is exactly the claim that AB ∈ SO(2).

3) Final check for differences:
- Dimension 2 over ℝ matches O(2), SO(2) over reals.
- Orthogonality is encoded as AᵀA = I (standard), determinant conditions match reflections/rotations.
- The product considered is A * B, i.e., the product of two reflections as in the statement.
No extraneous assumptions or missing conditions. The formal statement is exactly equivalent to the natural language claim.

2) Assessment of whether this matches the natural language statement:
The natural statement: For A ∈ O(n) with columns A1, …, An, deduce that {A1, …, An} is an orthonormal basis of ℝ^n. This includes both:
- Orthogonality/orthonormality of the columns.
- That the set of columns forms a basis of ℝ^n (i.e., they are linearly independent and span ℝ^n). In ℝ^n, an orthonormal family of n vectors is automatically a basis.

The Lean code proves only that the columns are orthonormal (cols_are_orthonormal). It does not state or deduce that the columns form a basis of ℝ^n. There is no mention of spanning, linear independence, or basis, nor the standard consequence that an orthonormal family of size n in ℝ^n is a basis.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Natural language: asserts orthonormal basis.
- Lean code: asserts orthonormal columns only.
Thus, the code captures only part of the statement (orthonormality) and omits the basis conclusion. All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders), and the formalization framework (Fin n → ℝ with dot product) appropriately models ℝ^n, but the final theorem is weaker than the original statement.

Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful due to the missing basis component.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `def GL (n : ℕ) : Type := (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)ˣ`
  This defines GL(n, ℝ) to be the type of units (invertible elements) in the ring of n×n real matrices. In other words, its elements are invertible matrices together with their inverses (the standard `Units` structure in mathlib).
- `instance GL_group (n : ℕ) : Group (GL n) := by sorry`
  This declares that GL(n, ℝ) has a group structure. For `Units` of any monoid, the group operation is the underlying multiplication (here, matrix multiplication), identity is the identity matrix, and inverses are the unit inverses. The proof is omitted, but the statement is that GL(n, ℝ) forms a group under matrix multiplication.

2) Fidelity to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement defines GL(n) explicitly as the set `{A ∈ Mat_{n×n}(ℝ) : det A ≠ 0}` and asks to show that it is a group under matrix multiplication. The code instead defines GL(n, ℝ) as the units of the matrix ring. Over ℝ, these two notions are equivalent: an n×n real matrix is a unit in the matrix ring if and only if it is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. The code does not state or prove the equivalence with the determinant characterization, but it does capture the core content “GL(n, ℝ) is a group under matrix multiplication” via the standard units construction.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Difference: The code uses the units definition rather than the subset `{A : det A ≠ 0}`. These are equivalent over ℝ, but the equivalence is not mentioned or proved in the code. This is a standard and faithful formalization choice in mathlib.
- Alignment: The group operation is indeed matrix multiplication (as inherited from the monoid structure on matrices via `Units`).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: `GL` is a legitimate definition; the group instance statement is legitimate (though the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable here as we’re checking translation, not proof).

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful: it asserts that the general linear group of n×n real matrices (presented as units) is a group under multiplication. The only minor mismatch is not spelling out the determinant characterization.

- def G_set : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { M | M 0 0 = M 1 1 ∧ M 0 1 = -M 1 0 }:
  This defines G_set as the subset of 2×2 real matrices whose diagonal entries are equal and whose (0,1)-entry is the negative of the (1,0)-entry. Any such matrix is of the form [[a, -b], [b, a]] with a = M 0 0 = M 1 1 and b = M 1 0.
- theorem G_is_add_subgroup : IsAddSubgroup (G_set : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)) := by sorry:
  This asserts that G_set is an additive subgroup of the additive group of all 2×2 real matrices; i.e., it contains 0, is closed under addition and additive inverses. This is exactly what is needed to conclude G is a group under matrix addition.
- def complex_to_matrix (z : Complex ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...:
  This defines the map sending a complex number z = a + bi to the matrix [[a, -b], [b, a]] by using z.re and z.im to fill the entries. Concretely: (0,0)=z.re, (0,1) = -z.im, (1,0)=z.im, (1,1)=z.re.
- def complex_matrix_add_equiv : AddEquiv (Complex ℝ) { M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // M ∈ G_set } := by sorry:
  This declares an additive group isomorphism between the additive group of complex numbers and the subtype of matrices lying in G_set, i.e., an explicit isomorphism (ℂ,+) ≅ G. The intended map is z ↦ ⟨complex_to_matrix z, membership proof⟩.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- The original: Define G = {[[a, -b], [b, a]] : a,b ∈ ℝ]. Prove G is a group under matrix addition and construct an isomorphism (ℂ,+) ≅ G.
- The code: Defines G_set exactly as that set in terms of equalities of entries; proves it is an additive subgroup (hence a group under addition); and constructs an additive equivalence between ℂ and G_set via the standard identification a+bi ↦ [[a, -b], [b, a]].
- The target of the isomorphism is the subtype {M // M ∈ G_set}, which is the standard formal way to view the set G as a type with inherited structure. This faithfully matches the intended G.

Step 3: Final check for differences or red flags.
- Faithfulness of G_set: The conditions M 0 0 = M 1 1 and M 0 1 = - M 1 0 are equivalent to the matrix being [[a, -b], [b, a]] with a = M 0 0, b = M 1 0. So the definition matches the natural-language G exactly.
- Proving G is a group: Stating IsAddSubgroup for G_set captures exactly closure under addition and negation, hence the additive group structure, as requested.
- Isomorphism: Using AddEquiv between ℂ and the subtype G_set is precisely an additive group isomorphism (ℂ,+) ≅ G.
- Auxiliary definitions: All are legitimate and not vacuous placeholders. No fake definitions like := True or none are used. Proofs are omitted with sorry, which is acceptable here since we only audit the statements.
- Minor library naming/type issues (e.g., Complex ℝ vs ℂ) would be implementation details and do not affect the faithfulness of the mathematical translation, especially under the assumption the code compiles in this context.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully formalizes the natural language statement: it defines G correctly, asserts it is an additive subgroup (hence a group under addition), and defines the standard additive isomorphism between complex numbers and G.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Bring in Mathlib and open Matrix namespace; standard setup.
- `def H0 : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...`: Defines the 2×2 real matrix H0 by entries: if i=j and i=0 then 1, if i=j and i≠0 then −1, else 0. Over `Fin 2`, this is exactly the diagonal matrix diag(1, −1), i.e., reflection across the x-axis.
- The theorem `improper_mult_with_reflection_in_SO` takes a 2×2 real matrix `H` with hypotheses `(hH : H.transpose * H = 1)` and `(hdet : H.det = -1)`. The first hypothesis expresses that H is orthogonal (H ∈ O(2)), the second that H is improper (det H = −1).
- The conclusion is a conjunction of four facts: `(H0 * H).transpose * (H0 * H) = 1` and `(H0 * H).det = 1` and `(H * H0).transpose * (H * H0) = 1` and `(H * H0).det = 1`. This says both `H0 * H` and `H * H0` are orthogonal (transpose times itself equals identity) and have determinant 1; i.e., both are in SO(2).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For any 2×2 improper orthogonal matrix H (H ∈ O(2), det H = −1), both products H0 H and H H0 belong to SO(2), with H0 = diag(1, −1) the reflection across the x-axis.
- The Lean code encodes exactly this: H is a 2×2 real matrix satisfying HᵀH = I (orthogonal) and det H = −1 (improper). H0 is defined as diag(1, −1). The conclusion states orthogonality and determinant 1 for both products, which is precisely membership in SO(2). Using explicit properties instead of a `SpecialOrthogonalGroup` type or set is a faithful formulation.
- The use of ℝ and `Fin 2` matches the 2×2 real matrix setting. H0 is correctly defined as the x-axis reflection.

Checks for red flags:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: H0 is a concrete matrix. The theorem statement is precise; the proof is `sorry`, which is acceptable here as we only judge the statement’s faithfulness, not the proof.
- No extraneous or missing conditions: The hypotheses match “H ∈ O(2)” and “det H = −1”; the conclusions match “∈ SO(2)”. The statement covers both left and right products as in the natural language.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `theorem srdoty_alg_present_327 : True := by trivial`: States and proves the proposition `True`. This is a vacuous theorem unrelated to groups, presentations, or quaternions.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The original statement: Show that the quaternion group Q = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, with specified multiplication rules, is presented by ⟨a, b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2⟩. This concerns a concrete group isomorphism between Q and the group with given generators and relations.

The Lean code provides no definitions of Q, no group presentation, and no theorem relating them. It merely asserts `True`. Therefore, it does not translate the mathematical statement at all.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
They are completely different. The Lean statement is a trivial tautology; the natural language statement is a nontrivial algebraic claim about group presentations. There are no auxiliary definitions attempting to model Q or the presented group; no placeholders besides proving `True`. The code is thus entirely unrelated to the target statement.

- `def SO_units : Set ((Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)ˣ) := { u | (u : Matrix ...) ⬝ (u : Matrix ...).transpose = 1 ∧ Matrix.det (u : Matrix ...) = 1 }`
  This defines SO(n) as the set of invertible n×n real matrices (viewed as units in the matrix ring) such that A · Aᵀ = I and det A = 1. In other words, it encodes the usual “special orthogonal” conditions in the ambient group of invertible matrices.
- `theorem is_subgroup_SO : IsSubgroup (SO_units n : Set ((Matrix ...)ˣ)) := by sorry`
  This asserts that the above set is a subgroup of the group of units of n×n real matrices (i.e., a subgroup of GL(n, ℝ)). This matches the claim that SO(n) is a matrix group.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: SO(n) = {A in O(n) : det A = 1} is a matrix group. The code defines SO(n) as the set of matrices satisfying A Aᵀ = I and det A = 1, within the units. Over ℝ, A Aᵀ = I is equivalent to A ∈ O(n), and such A are invertible, so working inside the units is appropriate and standard in formalizations. The theorem then states that this set is a subgroup of the group of units, which is exactly the formal notion of being a “matrix group.”
- Although the code uses A Aᵀ = I instead of Aᵀ A = I, these are equivalent for square real matrices and thus characterize O(n) equally well. The determinant condition det A = 1 is included as required.
- The ambient group chosen is the units of the matrix ring, which corresponds to GL(n, ℝ), in line with “matrix group.”

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are the same: the Lean code defines the correct set for SO(n) and asserts it forms a subgroup of the invertible matrices, thus a matrix group. There are no vacuous placeholders; the auxiliary definition is substantive. The only stylistic nuance is using A Aᵀ = I, which is equivalent, and working in units rather than, say, GeneralLinearGroup explicitly, which is a standard formal choice.

3) Final check (comparison of the two statements):
- Original: specifies a family of linear maps (reflections parameterized by θ), claims linearity, orthogonality, and determinant −1.
- Lean: proves a trivial proposition `True` with no relation to the original content.
They are completely different. No auxiliary definitions are present; the only theorem is vacuous and unrelated.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem identity_factorization_even_transpositions {n : Nat} (n_pos : 1 ≤ n) :` introduces a theorem for a natural number n with the assumption n ≥ 1.
- `∀ (l : List (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))),` means for every finite list l of permutations of Fin n (i.e., elements of S_n acting on n letters).
- `(∀ p ∈ l, ∃ (i j : Fin n), i ≠ j ∧ p = Equiv.Perm.swap i j) →` assumes that every permutation p appearing in the list l is a transposition, i.e., there exist distinct i, j in Fin n such that p is the swap of i and j.
- `List.prod l = (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) →` assumes the product (composition) of the permutations in l equals the identity permutation.
- `l.length % 2 = 0` concludes that the length of l is even.
There are no auxiliary definitions; the code relies on standard Mathlib notions: `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` for S_n, `swap` for a transposition, `List.prod` for the product in the group, and equality to `1` for the identity.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For n ≥ 1, every factorization of the identity in S_n as a product of transpositions uses an even number of transpositions.
- Lean: For n ≥ 1, any list of permutations on Fin n, each a transposition, whose product is the identity, has even length.
These match exactly: Fin n is a standard model for an n-element set; transpositions are modeled by `swap i j` with i ≠ j; the product being the identity corresponds to the factorization of id; the conclusion says the number of transpositions (list length) is even. The empty product case (length 0) is allowed and even; this aligns with common usage.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: {1,...,n} vs Fin n — these are canonically equivalent for S_n; no substantive difference.
- Assumption n ≥ 1 is present in both. Even if n = 0 were allowed, the statement would still hold, so this is a harmless specialization.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; everything is standard Mathlib.
Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
- The natural language statement says SO(2), the group of proper orthogonal 2×2 matrices (i.e., orthogonal with determinant 1), equals the set of rotation matrices R_θ. The Lean statement expresses exactly the set of matrices with det A = 1 and Aᵀ A = I equals the image of θ ↦ R_θ. This matches the usual definition of SO(2) and the characterization as rotations.

3) Final check for differences:
- Using Aᵀ A = I (instead of A Aᵀ = I) is an equivalent orthogonality condition over ℝ for square matrices and suffices. The set is presented, not explicitly as a group, but the natural language equality is about sets; this is acceptable. The rotation matrix is correctly defined. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; the auxiliary definition is substantive. No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `def O (n : Nat) := Subtype ...`: Define O(n) as the subtype of n×n real matrices A (indexed by `Fin n`) such that A ⬝ Aᵀ = I. This matches the usual set-theoretic definition O(n) = { A | A A^T = I }.
- `instance O_group (n : Nat) : Group (O n) := by sorry`: Declare that O(n) carries a group structure. However, the entire structure (including the multiplication, identity, inversion, and proofs of the axioms) is provided by `sorry`, i.e., not specified. The comment says “under matrix multiplication,” but the formal instance does not actually encode that choice.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: Using (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} and (AB)^T = B^T A^T, prove that O(n) = {A : A A^T = I} is a group under matrix multiplication.
- The definition of O(n) in Lean matches the intended set: A A^T = I.
- The conclusion that O(n) is a group under matrix multiplication should be formalized by constructing a specific Group structure whose multiplication is the restriction of matrix multiplication to O(n), identity is the identity matrix, and inverses are given by transposes (using the stated identities). 
- The provided instance uses `by sorry`, which leaves not only the axioms but also the operations themselves unspecified. This is not merely an omitted proof of a proposition; it fails to pin down that the group operation is the ambient matrix multiplication. In Lean, a `Group` instance is data, not just a Prop; with `by sorry`, the multiplication, identity, and inverse could be anything. Thus, the code does not faithfully assert “under matrix multiplication.”
- Moreover, the statement in NL mentions using specific identities to show closure and inverses; the code does not reflect or reference these identities (which is acceptable if the final statement were a proper assertion), but here the instance is a vacuous placeholder.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Same: The set O(n) is correctly defined as {A | A A^T = I}.
- Different: The Lean code does not actually assert the group operation is matrix multiplication; the `Group (O n)` instance is entirely `sorry`. Hence the essential content “under matrix multiplication” is not enforced. This makes the translation not faithful, as it could in principle be any group structure on the subtype, not necessarily the inherited one from matrices.

Conclusion: The auxiliary definition `O` is legitimate, but the key group instance is vacuous and does not encode “under matrix multiplication.” Therefore the translation fails under the given guidelines.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def E {F : Type*} [Field F] (t : F) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F := ...`
  This defines, for any field F and any t in F, a 2×2 matrix E(t) with indices in Fin 2. The body specifies entries by cases on the row i and column j:
  - If i = 0 and j = 0, return 1.
  - If i = 0 and j ≠ 0 (so j = 1), return t.
  - If i ≠ 0 (so i = 1) and j = 0, return 0.

  Hence E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]] as intended.

  This states that for any field F and any t in F, the matrix inverse of E(t) equals E(-t). There is no proof provided (by sorry), but the statement precisely asserts the claimed identity.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement is: For a field F and E(t) = [[1, t], [0, 1]] with t in F, show that E(t)^{-1} = E(-t) for all t in F. The Lean definition E matches the matrix [[1, t], [0, 1]], and the theorem statement exactly claims (E t)⁻¹ = E (-t) for all t in F. The indexing via Fin 2 is a standard formalization of 2×2 matrices and does not change the meaning. No extra hypotheses (like t ≠ 0) are introduced, which is correct since the matrix is invertible for all t with inverse E(-t).

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; E is a concrete definition.
- The theorem is stated exactly as in the natural language statement.
- No extraneous conditions or generalizations are introduced.
Therefore, the formal statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
The natural language: ""Let F be a field and G={E(t): t∈F} with E(t)=[[1,t],[0,1]]. Prove that G is a matrix group under multiplication."" This means: G, as a set of 2×2 matrices over F, is a group under matrix multiplication. To assert this for a subset, one typically needs: identity in G, closure under multiplication, and closure under inversion (i.e., for any A ∈ G, A⁻¹ ∈ G). Associativity is inherited from matrices.
The Lean code defines E and G correctly and states the correct multiplication and identity facts. It also states an inverse fact (E_inv) that suggests inverses are of the same form E(−t). However, the final ""subgroup"" theorem G_is_subgroup is weaker than required: it asserts existence of a two-sided inverse for each A ∈ G, but it does not assert that this inverse lies in G. Thus it does not formally establish that G is closed under inversion, which is necessary to conclude that G itself is a group (or a subgroup) under multiplication.

3) Final check for differences:
- Correct: E is the intended unipotent upper-triangular matrix; G is the set {E(t)}.
- Correct: Closure under multiplication (E_mul) and identity (E_one) are stated.
- Missing/Weakened: The final theorem does not state that inverses are in G (only that some inverse exists in the ambient matrix group). To be faithful to ""G is a matrix group under multiplication"", it should assert ∀ A ∈ G, ∃ C ∈ G, A * C = 1 ∧ C * A = 1 (or equivalently C = A⁻¹ ∈ G). The earlier E_inv suggests the right result (inverse is E(−t)), but G_is_subgroup does not encode that membership requirement.
- Use of sorries for proofs is acceptable per the task, since we're auditing the statement/translation, not the proofs.

Conclusion: The translation is almost correct, but the crucial membership condition for inverses is missing in the final statement, so it is not fully faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

1) Theorem `infinite_cyclic_group_mul_isomorphic_to_additive_Int`:
- Statement: For any type G with a group structure [Group G], which is cyclic [IsCyclic G] and infinite (hinf : IsInfinite G), there exists a multiplicative equivalence `MulEquiv` between G and `Additive Int`.
- Natural language translation: Any infinite cyclic (multiplicative) group G is isomorphic, as a multiplicative group, to `Additive Int`.
- Technical issue: `MulEquiv` is an isomorphism respecting multiplication. `Additive α` is the wrapper that turns a multiplicative structure on α into an additive structure on `Additive α`. It does not provide a multiplicative structure. Thus, `MulEquiv G (Additive Int)` is not the correct way to express “G is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ”. The correct formalizations would be either:
  - `MulEquiv G (Multiplicative ℤ)` (turn ℤ’s additive structure into a multiplicative one), or
  - `AddEquiv (Additive G) ℤ` (turn G’s multiplicative structure into an additive one and use an additive isomorphism).
So, as written, this target does not faithfully represent “isomorphic to the additive group ℤ”. It also likely would not typeclass-resolve (since `Additive Int` has an Add structure, not Mul), but even ignoring that, it’s the wrong wrapper relative to the intended statement.

2) Theorem `finite_cyclic_group_mul_isomorphic_to_multiplicative_ZMod`:
- Statement: For any finite cyclic group G ([Group G], [IsCyclic G], [Fintype G]), there exists a natural number n > 0 and a multiplicative equivalence `MulEquiv` between G and `Multiplicative (ZMod n)`.
- Natural language translation: Any finite cyclic (multiplicative) group is isomorphic (as a multiplicative group) to `Multiplicative (ZMod n)`. Since `Multiplicative` turns the additive structure on `ZMod n` into a multiplicative one, this says exactly that G is isomorphic to the additive group Z_n.
- This matches the original statement faithfully, including the requirement n > 0 and the “for some n” quantifier.

Whole translation vs original statement:
- Original: Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ. Any finite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group ℤ_n for some n > 0.
- Code: Finite case is faithful. Infinite case uses the wrong wrapper (`Additive Int` under a `MulEquiv`) instead of `Multiplicative ℤ` or an additive equivalence; hence it does not correctly represent an isomorphism to the additive group of ℤ.

Final check and differences:
- The second theorem matches the statement well.
- The first theorem does not faithfully express the isomorphism to the additive group ℤ due to the incorrect use of `Additive` instead of `Multiplicative` (or an additive equivalence). This is a substantive mismatch in the formalization of the intended group structure.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful due to the first theorem; the second theorem is correct.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: We use Mathlib's definitions and theorems. 
- The docstring: ""/-- For n ≥ 1, the sign of the product of two permutations equals the product of their signs. -/"" describes the theorem informally (though the statement itself will not enforce `n ≥ 1`).
- `theorem perm_sign_mul {n : Nat} (α β : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : (α * β).sign = α.sign * β.sign := by sorry`
  This states: For a natural number `n` and permutations `α, β` of `Fin n` (the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`), the sign of the product `(α * β)` equals the product of the signs `α.sign * β.sign`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- The natural language statement: For `n ≥ 1`, with `S_n` the symmetric group on `{1, ..., n}`, and any `α, β ∈ S_n`, prove `sgn(αβ) = sgn(α) sgn(β)`.
- Lean uses `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` to represent `S_n`. The difference `{1,...,n}` vs `Fin n = {0,...,n-1}` is a harmless reindexing; they are canonically in bijection and standard in formalizations.
- The operation `(α * β)` in `Equiv.Perm` is composition, matching the group operation in `S_n`. The `sign` is the usual sign homomorphism; the statement asserts multiplicativity.

Step 3: Compare the two statements
- The only discrepancy is that the Lean theorem does not require `n ≥ 1`, while the natural language states it. However, the result holds for `n = 0` as well (the symmetric group on the empty set is trivial, and the identity has sign 1), so the Lean version is a slight generalization and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib notions. The statement precisely captures the intended mathematical content.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization (indeed a slight generalization) of the given statement.

The natural language asks to show that the map φ: G → G × H given by φ(x) = (x,1) is an injective homomorphism. The code defines φ as a monoid (hence group) homomorphism with the specified formula and states a theorem asserting φ is injective. This captures both parts: being a homomorphism and being injective.

3) Final check:
- Same domain/codomain and formula: yes, φ(x) = (x, 1) into G × H.
- Homomorphism: encoded by `G →* G × H` with the requisite properties proved by simp.
- Injectivity: stated as a theorem. Although the proof is `sorry`, the translation goal is the statement, not the proof.
No auxiliary vacuous definitions are used; φ is a legitimate definition using Mathlib structures. The translation is faithful.

- The Lean code does not mention SO(2), rotations, groups, or isomorphisms. The theorem merely asserts `True`, which is a vacuous and unrelated proposition. Additionally, the proof is a placeholder (`sorry`).

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The original claims a specific group isomorphism. The Lean code states and (vacuously) attempts to prove `True`. There is no alignment between the formal statement and the natural language claim. The discrepancy is total: missing definitions, no statement of isomorphism, and a placeholder proof.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R]` and `variable {n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: We are working with matrices over a commutative ring R, indexed by a finite type n (so we have n×n matrices with decidable equality on indices).
- `def D1_set : Set (Matrix n n R) := { A | A.det = 1 ∧ ∀ i j, i ≠ j → A i j = 0 }`: This defines the set of n×n matrices over R that are diagonal (all off-diagonal entries 0) and have determinant 1. In other words, diagonal matrices in SL(n, R). This faithfully matches “the set of all diagonal matrices in SL(n).”
- `def D1_units : Set (Units (Matrix n n R)) := { u | (u.val).det = 1 ∧ ∀ i j, i ≠ j → (u.val : Matrix n n R) i j = 0 }`: This is the analogous subset but viewed inside the unit group GL(n, R) = Units (Matrix n n R). Over a commutative ring, matrices with det = 1 are indeed units, so this is a reasonable formalization of the same set within GL(n, R).
- `def D1_subgroup : Subgroup (Units (Matrix n n R)) := by sorry`: This purports to define a subgroup of GL(n, R), presumably intended to be the subgroup of diagonal matrices with determinant 1. However, it uses `sorry`, so the actual definition is missing and not tied to `D1_units` or `D1_set` in any way. It’s a vacuous placeholder.

Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language asks to show that D1(n), the set of diagonal matrices in SL(n), is a matrix group (i.e., a subgroup of GL(n, R)). The code sets up the relevant sets (as matrices and as units) faithfully.
- However, the crucial part—exhibiting D1(n) as a subgroup—is not provided. The `D1_subgroup` definition is left as `sorry` and does not define the subgroup from `D1_units`. According to the guidelines, a vacuous definition (filled with `sorry`) causes the translation to fail.

Final check:
- The mathematical content intended is correct (defining diagonal det=1 matrices and aiming to show they form a subgroup of GL), but the final step is missing via a placeholder. Thus, the code does not successfully translate the statement into a legitimate, faithful Lean declaration of the subgroup.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful due to the vacuous `D1_subgroup` definition. If that `sorry` were replaced by an actual construction of the subgroup using `D1_units` (e.g., as a `Subgroup` with carrier `D1_units` and proofs of closure), it would be faithful.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For n ≥ 2, S_n is generated by the adjacent transpositions {(1,2), (2,3), …, (n−1,n)}.
- The Lean statement: For n ≥ 2, True. This is completely unrelated in logical content to the group-theoretic claim. There is no mention of `Perm (Fin n)`, no subgroup closure, no generating set, and no equality to `⊤`.
- The docstring acknowledges the intended statement but the actual theorem is not that statement.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is vacuous and does not assert anything about S_n, generators, or adjacent transpositions. The hypothesis `2 ≤ n` is present but unused. There are no auxiliary definitions; however, the only theorem is vacuous and thus unfaithful.
- Differences: The Lean code claims `True` instead of the generation result; it omits all relevant algebraic structures and properties.

Conclusion: The translation fails. It is not a legitimate, faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open List`: bring in Mathlib and open list notation/functions.
- The docstring: ""Let n ≥ 2. The symmetric group S_n is generated by the transposition (0 1) and the n-cycle (0 1 2 ... n-1)."" This matches the intended mathematical statement, using 0-based indexing on Fin n.
- `theorem symmetric_group_generated_by_transposition_and_cycle {n : Nat} (hn : 2 ≤ n) : ... = (⊤ : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)))` states that for natural n with 2 ≤ n, the subgroup generated by a certain two-element set equals the top subgroup (the entire group) of permutations on Fin n.
- The generating set is `{ Equiv.swap (Fin n) (0 : Fin n) (1 : Fin n), (Perm.cycle ((range n).map (fun k => (k : Fin n))) : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) }`:
  - `Equiv.swap (Fin n) 0 1` is the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in the finite set {0, ..., n-1}.
  - `Perm.cycle ((range n).map (fun k => (k : Fin n)))` is the permutation that cycles through the list [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1], i.e., the n-cycle (0 1 2 ... n-1), fixing everything else (there is nothing else in Fin n). The use of `(range n).map (fun k => (k : Fin n))` constructs the list of all elements of Fin n in order.
- `Subgroup.closure (...) = ⊤` means the subgroup generated by these two permutations is the whole symmetric group `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.
- The proof is `by sorry`, but per instructions the proof content is irrelevant; only the statement matters.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement: For n ≥ 2, S_n is generated by the two elements {(1,2), (1,2,3,...,n)}.
- The Lean statement: For n ≥ 2, the subgroup of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` generated by { (0 1), (0 1 2 ... n-1) } is the entire group. This is exactly the same content, with 0-based indexing on Fin n instead of 1-based indexing on {1,...,n}. Using Subgroup.closure to express “generated by” is standard.
- All constructs used (Equiv.Perm, Equiv.swap, Perm.cycle, Subgroup.closure, ⊤) are legitimate Mathlib definitions; there are no placeholders or vacuous definitions.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Difference: 1-based vs 0-based indexing. The Lean code uses elements 0 and 1 of Fin n, and the n-cycle (0 1 2 ... n-1). This is a harmless relabeling and is mathematically equivalent to the statement with (1 2) and (1 2 ... n) on {1,...,n}.
- No other discrepancies; hypotheses (n ≥ 2) match, and the conclusion precisely states that the two given permutations generate S_n.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `axiom is_isomorphic_to_S5 {G : Type*} [Group G] : Prop` introduces an uninterpreted predicate saying “G is isomorphic to S5.” It is not tied to Mathlib’s notion of group isomorphism; it’s a placeholder.
- `axiom A5_is_simple_nonabelian : Prop` introduces an uninterpreted proposition asserting “A5 is simple nonabelian.” Again, a placeholder, not Mathlib’s `SimpleGroup` on an actual group `AlternatingGroup 5`.
- `axiom solvable_group {G : Type*} [Group G] : Prop` introduces an uninterpreted predicate “G is solvable.” It does not use Mathlib’s `IsSolvable G` (or related standard notions).
- `theorem S5_not_solvable ... : ¬ solvable_group (G := G) := by sorry` states: if G is isomorphic to S5 and A5 is simple nonabelian, then G is not solvable (in the sense of the placeholder predicate). The proof is omitted (`sorry`).
- `theorem general_quintic_not_solvable_by_radicals ... : ¬ solvable_group (G := G) := by sorry` restates the same group-level conclusion under the same hypotheses, just with a suggestive name. There is no mention of polynomials, Galois groups, or radicals in the formal statement; the proof is omitted.

2) Does the whole translation match the original natural language statement?
- The original statement is about the general quintic polynomial: using that A5 is simple and the (generic) Galois group over the rational function field is S5, conclude that the roots cannot be expressed in terms of radicals. Formally, one wants a statement tying the Galois group (isomorphic to S5) to non-solvability by radicals via the standard theorem “solvable by radicals iff the Galois group is solvable.”
- The code does not formalize polynomials, their Galois groups, or radicals. It introduces three placeholders and proves (with `sorry`) a purely group-theoretic non-solvability statement for an arbitrary group G under the hypothesis `is_isomorphic_to_S5`. The second theorem merely repeats the first with a different name; it still does not mention polynomials or radicals.
- Thus, the code fails to express the core claim about “roots of a general quintic cannot be expressed in terms of radicals.” It neither states nor uses the correspondence between solvable-by-radicals and solvable Galois group, nor does it connect `G` to the Galois group of the general quintic.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Natural language: a field-theoretic claim about the general quintic not being solvable by radicals, assuming its Galois group is S5 and that A5 is simple nonabelian.
- Lean code: a group-theoretic claim that any group isomorphic to S5 is not solvable (using placeholders), with no mention of polynomials, Galois theory, or radicals. The theorem named “general_quintic_not_solvable_by_radicals” still only concludes `¬ solvable_group G` for an arbitrary group G; it does not state anything about polynomials or radicals.
- Differences:
  - Missing the object “general quintic” and its Galois group.
  - Missing the notion “solvable by radicals” and its relation to “solvable group.”
  - Uses non-Mathlib placeholder predicates instead of standard notions.
  - The second theorem is just a renamed copy of the first, not a faithful formalization of the intended conclusion.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. It uses placeholders/axioms rather than Mathlib concepts and does not even state the intended field-theoretic result about polynomials and radicals.

- The theorem `mul_hom_injective_iff_ker_eq_bot (f : G →* H) : Function.Injective (f : G → H) ↔ f.ker = (⊥ : Subgroup G)` states: For a group homomorphism f from G to H (encoded as a monoid homomorphism `G →* H` with groups), f is injective if and only if its kernel is the trivial subgroup (⊥ in `Subgroup G`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural statement says: For a group homomorphism f: G → H with kernel K, f is injective iff K is the trivial subgroup. In Lean, `f.ker` denotes K, and `⊥ : Subgroup G` denotes the trivial subgroup. The equivalence matches the bi-implication in the natural language statement. Not explicitly naming K but using `f.ker` is standard and equivalent.

3) Final check:
Both problems are the same: injectivity of a group homomorphism is equivalent to having trivial kernel. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions. The order of the ↔ is immaterial. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This declares a theorem: Assuming `h`, which asserts that `alternatingGroup (Fin 5)` (i.e., A5 as the subgroup of even permutations on 5 elements) is a simple group, conclude that `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` (i.e., S5, the symmetric group on 5 elements) is not solvable. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but for the purposes of translation fidelity, only the statement matters.

The terms used are standard Mathlib:
- `alternatingGroup (Fin 5)` denotes A5 as a subgroup of permutations on 5 letters, with induced group structure, so `IsSimpleGroup (alternatingGroup (Fin 5))` is the usual simplicity assertion for A5.
- `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` denotes S5.
- `IsSolvable` and `IsSimpleGroup` are the standard group-theoretic predicates in Mathlib.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement: ""Assuming that A5 is a simple group (this was proved by Galois) show that S5 is not a solvable group."" The Lean theorem states exactly: from the assumption that A5 is simple, deduce that S5 is not solvable. This is precisely the same claim.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The hypothesis and conclusion align exactly with the natural language.
- No unintended generalization or specialization is present; it is exactly the stated case for 5 letters.
Thus, the translation is faithful.

- `def is_cyclic_prime (G : Type u) [Group G] [Fintype G] : Prop := ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ Fintype.card G = p`
  Natural language: For a finite group G, the predicate `is_cyclic_prime G` means G has prime order. In group theory, a finite group of prime order is cyclic, so this captures “G is cyclic of prime order.”
- `variable (is_alternating_group : Type u → Prop) (is_lie_type : Type u → Prop) (is_sporadic_group : Type u → Prop)`
  Natural language: Introduce three arbitrary predicates on types: one intended to mean “is an alternating group,” one for “is of Lie type,” and one for “is sporadic.” These are placeholders with no definitions or constraints.
- `theorem classification_of_finite_simple_groups (G : Type u) [Group G] [Fintype G] [IsSimpleGroup G] : is_cyclic_prime G ∨ is_alternating_group G ∨ is_lie_type G ∨ is_sporadic_group G := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any finite simple group G, one of the four predicates holds: either G has prime order, or G satisfies the (unspecified) alternating predicate, or the (unspecified) Lie type predicate, or the (unspecified) sporadic predicate. The proof is omitted.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement is the full Classification of Finite Simple Groups: every finite simple group is isomorphic to exactly one among (1) cyclic of prime order, (2) an alternating group A_n with n ≥ 5, (3) a simple group of Lie type (broken down into classical and exceptional/twisted, including Tits), or (4) one of the 26 sporadic groups.
- The Lean code’s `is_cyclic_prime` is acceptable as a stand-in because a finite group of prime order is cyclic, so “prime order” captures “cyclic of prime order.”
- However, the other three families are represented by completely unconstrained placeholder predicates `is_alternating_group`, `is_lie_type`, and `is_sporadic_group`. They are variables, not definitions; nothing enforces that they correspond to “isomorphic to A_n for n ≥ 5,” “isomorphic to a (finite) simple group of Lie type,” or “isomorphic to one of the 26 sporadics.” This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders: these are not faithful definitions.
- The theorem statement lacks the “is isomorphic to” phrasing. For the prime order case, that’s okay, but for alternating/Lie type/sporadic, the classification is about isomorphism to specific known groups; a predicate on the type itself is insufficient unless defined to encode isomorphism to the specified family. Since these are arbitrary predicates, the theorem can be made trivially true or false depending on how one instantiates them, hence it is not a faithful rendering.
- The statement also omits the constraint “degree at least 5” for alternating groups, which should be baked into the definition. Again, the placeholders could in principle include it, but here they are unspecified.
- The breakdown of Lie type into classical, exceptional, twisted, and mention of the Tits group is compressed into a single placeholder, losing the specificity.

Final comparison:
- The Lean code uses vacuous placeholders for the key families and does not encode isomorphism classes. Therefore, it is not a legitimate, faithful translation of the classification theorem.
- If the placeholder predicates were replaced by precise Mathlib definitions encoding “isomorphic to A_n (n ≥ 5),” “isomorphic to a finite simple group of Lie type (including all specified subfamilies),” and “isomorphic to one of the 26 sporadics,” then the overall shape (a disjunction of the four cases for finite simple G) would be faithful. As written, it fails the fidelity requirement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def alpha : Perm (Fin 3) := swap (0 : Fin 3) 1`
  This defines α as the transposition swapping 0 and 1 in the symmetric group on Fin 3 = {0,1,2}. Under the standard relabeling {0,1,2} ↔ {1,2,3}, this corresponds to the transposition (1 2) in S_3, as in the natural-language statement.

- `def beta : Perm (Fin 3) := (swap (0 : Fin 3) 1).trans (swap 1 2)`
  This defines β as the composition of the transposition (0 1) followed by (1 2). The method `.trans` composes equivalences; in typical mathlib conventions, `e₁.trans e₂` applies `e₂` after `e₁` (i.e., x ↦ e₂(e₁(x))). With that convention, (0 1) then (1 2) is the 3-cycle (0 2 1), i.e., the inverse of (0 1 2). If `.trans` were defined in the opposite order, it would give (0 1 2). In either case, β is a 3-cycle on Fin 3, which corresponds (up to 0/1 indexing and possibly inversion) to (1 2 3) in S_3.

- `theorem generated_by_alpha_beta_eq_S3 : Subgroup.closure ({alpha, beta} : Set (Perm (Fin 3))) = (⊤ : Subgroup (Perm (Fin 3))) := by sorry`
  This asserts that the subgroup generated by α and β equals the top subgroup of Perm(Fin 3), i.e., the entire S_3. This matches the goal “Show that G = S_3” where G = ⟨α, β⟩.

Faithfulness check:
- The ambient group is S_3, represented as Perm (Fin 3); this is standard and faithful.
- α matches (1 2) up to the harmless 0/1 indexing shift.
- β is intended to be (1 2 3). The code defines it as a composition of two swaps; depending on the exact order of composition in `.trans`, this is either (0 1 2) or (0 2 1). If it is (0 2 1), that is the inverse 3-cycle. Both (0 1 2) and (0 2 1) are legitimate 3-cycles and, together with a transposition, generate S_3. Thus the conclusion G = S_3 is unchanged. However, strictly speaking, if β is the inverse, it does not exactly match the literal “β = (1 2 3)”. This is a very minor discrepancy that does not affect the main statement to be proved.
- The theorem statement exactly matches “G = S_3,” with G taken to be the subgroup generated by {α, β}. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; α and β are genuine elements of S_3.

Final comparison:
- The only possible difference is whether β is (1 2 3) or its inverse due to composition order in `.trans`. The main claim about the generated subgroup being all of S_3 is faithfully captured. Everything else matches the original statement up to the standard indexing shift from {1,2,3} to Fin 3 = {0,1,2}.

Given this, the translation is essentially faithful with a tiny potential mismatch on the exact orientation of the 3-cycle β.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Brings Mathlib into scope.
- universe u: Universe level declaration.
- constant my_Gal : Polynomial ℚ → Type u: Introduces an arbitrary type assigned to each polynomial over Q, intended to represent its Galois group, but with no connection to Mathlib’s actual Galois group or splitting fields.
- constant my_Gal_group : ∀ p : Polynomial ℚ, Group (my_Gal p): Asserts (by constant) that each my_Gal p has a group structure. This is not an instance and is completely unspecified.
- constant my_roots_expressible_by_radicals : Polynomial ℚ → Prop: An arbitrary predicate intended to mean “the complex roots of p are expressible by radicals,” but it has no content and doesn’t mention ℂ or radicals at all.
- constant my_irreducible_poly : Polynomial ℚ → Prop: An arbitrary predicate intended to be “p is irreducible,” not tied to Mathlib’s irreducible.
- constant my_is_solvable_group : ∀ (G : Type u), Group G → Prop: An arbitrary predicate intended to be “G is solvable,” not tied to Mathlib’s IsSolvable.
- theorem galois_group_solvable_iff_roots_by_radicals ... : my_roots_expressible_by_radicals p ↔ my_is_solvable_group (my_Gal p) (my_Gal_group p) := by sorry: States the main equivalence using the above placeholders, under the placeholder irreducibility hypothesis, with no proof.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement is a classical theorem: for an irreducible polynomial over Q, its complex roots are solvable by radicals iff its Galois group (over Q) is solvable. A faithful formalization should reference Mathlib’s notions: irreducible polynomial (Polynomial.irreducible), the Galois group Gal(splitting field/Q), and a formal notion of solvable group and radicals/splitting field in a radical extension.
- The code defines arbitrary placeholders for all of these core notions. None are tied to Mathlib’s actual definitions. This breaks the requirement that auxiliary definitions must faithfully describe what they claim to be.
- The predicate my_roots_expressible_by_radicals p does not even reference ℂ or radicals; it’s just a Prop. The group solvability predicate is also an arbitrary Prop depending on an arbitrary group structure, not Mathlib’s IsSolvable.
- Therefore, while the high-level shape of the theorem (equivalence between “roots by radicals” and “Galois group solvable” assuming irreducible) resembles the natural statement, the formalization is entirely placeholder-based and non-faithful.

Final check:
- The two math problems are not the same: the Lean code uses completely unspecified constants in place of the real mathematical concepts. There is no guarantee that my_Gal is the Galois group, that my_roots_expressible_by_radicals matches the intended property, or that my_is_solvable_group matches group solvability.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The overall structure would be correct if all placeholders were replaced by proper Mathlib notions, so this merits a mid score rather than the lowest.

2) Whole translation check:
The Lean statements exactly match the classical addition formulas for sine and cosine over the real numbers, universally quantified over θ1, θ2 ∈ ℝ. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorems are stated plainly with the expected Real.sin and Real.cos functions. The absence of proofs (use of `sorry`) is acceptable per the auditing instructions, which focus on faithful statement translation rather than proof.

3) Final comparison:
The natural language request asks for the addition formulas for sine and cosine for all real angles. The Lean code states precisely those two identities for all real θ1, θ2. The only difference is that the natural language asks for a conceptual derivation (a proof), whereas the Lean code leaves proofs as `sorry`; however, per the auditing guidelines, we only check the faithfulness of the statement, not the presence of proofs. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- def GL (n : Nat) : Type := Units (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ)
  Natural language: Define GL(n, ℝ) as the group of units (invertible elements) in the ring of n×n real matrices. This is a standard and faithful representation of GL(n, ℝ) as a type.

- def SL (n : Nat) : Type := { g : GL n // Matrix.det g.val = (1 : ℝ) }
  Natural language: Define SL(n, ℝ) as the subset of GL(n, ℝ) consisting of matrices with determinant 1. Implemented as a subtype. This matches the intended mathematical set, though it is not packaged as a subgroup/normal subgroup structure.

- theorem conjugation_preserves_det_one ... : Matrix.det ((g * h * g⁻¹).val) = (1 : ℝ)
  Natural language: If h has determinant 1, then so does its conjugate g h g⁻¹ in GL(n). This lemma expresses conjugation invariance of determinant-1. It is a correct step toward showing SL(n) is normal, but it does not itself state normality of SL(n) in GL(n).

- theorem det_surjective (n : Nat) (r : ℝ) (hr : r ≠ 0) : ∃ (g : GL n), Matrix.det g.val = r
  Natural language: For any nonzero real number r, there exists an invertible n×n real matrix with determinant r. Comment notes “n ≥ 1”, but the statement does not assume n ≥ 1. As stated, it is false for n = 0. Also, the comment mentions det : GL(n) → ℝ× is surjective, but the theorem targets ℝ, not the unit group ℝ× (Units ℝ). So this is mismatched and imprecise relative to the intended statement.

- theorem quotient_GL_SL_equiv_R_units (n : Nat) : True := by sorry
  Natural language: This does not assert any isomorphism. It is a vacuous statement of True and thus a placeholder. It fails to express “GL(n)/SL(n) ≃* ℝ×”. No quotient or isomorphism is stated.

Comparison to the original statement:
- The original asks to show SL(n) is a normal subgroup of GL(n) and that GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝ× (the multiplicative group of nonzero reals) via the determinant map.
- The code only provides a lemma about conjugation preserving determinant one; it does not formally state or prove “SL(n) ⊴ GL(n)”. There is no Subgroup or NormalSubgroup structure introduced for SL(n).
- The code attempts a surjectivity statement for det but misses the crucial condition n ≥ 1 and targets ℝ instead of Units ℝ. Thus it does not correctly capture “det is surjective onto ℝ×”.
- The final theorem asserting the quotient-isomorphism is replaced by a vacuous statement of True, not an isomorphism type like (GL n ⧸ SL n) ≃* (Units ℝ) or ℝˣ.

Final check:
- These discrepancies are substantial: missing normality statement, incorrect/underspecified surjectivity statement, and a completely vacuous final “isomorphism” theorem. Therefore, the Lean code does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

Grade rationale:
- While GL and SL are reasonably defined as types, the crucial assertions are either missing, misstated, or vacuous. Given the vacuous final theorem and missing normality formalization, along with the incorrect surjectivity statement (n ≥ 1 and codomain ℝ×), this is not a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {G : Type _} [Group G]`: We fix a group G.
- The theorem `unique_subgroup_of_order_normal {H : Subgroup G} [Fintype H] {n : Nat}` introduces a subgroup H of G which is finite (via `[Fintype H]`) and a natural number n.
- Hypothesis `hcard : Fintype.card H = n`: The order (cardinality) of H is n.
- Hypothesis `huniq : ∀ (K : Subgroup G) [Fintype K], Fintype.card K = n → K = H`: For any subgroup K of G that is finite, if its order is n, then K equals H. This encodes “H is the only subgroup of order n.”
- Conclusion `∀ g : G, Subgroup.conjugate g H = H`: For every g in G, the conjugate of H by g equals H. This is a standard equivalent formulation of normality; i.e., H is normal in G.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If H is a subgroup of order n in a group G and H is the only subgroup of order n, then H is normal (H ◁ G).
- The code assumes H is a finite subgroup with order n and uniqueness of any subgroup K of order n (expressed via `[Fintype K]` and `Fintype.card K = n → K = H`). The conclusion is that every conjugate of H equals H, which is equivalent to H being normal. This matches the intended statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code uses the equality of all conjugates with H to express normality, which is a standard equivalent condition. This is faithful to “H ◁ G.”
- The uniqueness hypothesis quantifies over subgroups K with a finite instance `[Fintype K]`, which is the formal way to state “order n” in Lean. This matches the usual meaning of “only subgroup of order n.”
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement directly encodes the claim.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language result.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib`: imports the mathematics library.
- The next block is a comment describing the intended translation and includes a commented-out example:
  - It states: if `H` and `K` are normal in `G` and `H ≤ K`, then `(Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk H) K).normal ∧ Subgroup.quotient (Subgroup.map (QuotientGroup.mk H) K) ≃* Subgroup.quotient K`.
  - This commented-out code uses `sorry` and is not part of the compiled code. It would have expressed that the image of `K` in `G ⧸ H` (i.e., `K/H`) is normal in `G/H`, and that the quotient `(G/H)/(K/H)` is isomorphic to `G/K`.
- The only actual compiled code is `example : True := by trivial`, which just proves `True`.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement is the third isomorphism theorem: If `H ◃ G`, `K ◃ G`, and `H ⊆ K`, then `K/H ◃ G/H` and `(G/H)/(K/H) ≅ G/K`.
- The compiled Lean code does not state or prove anything about groups, normality, or quotients; it only proves `True`.
- The commented-out snippet (not compiled) informally matches the intended theorem statement in Mathlib terms, but it is not active and contains `sorry`.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- The actual compiled code is completely unrelated to the theorem. It neither states nor proves the given claim.
- Even if we considered the commented-out line, it is not accepted (commented and with `sorry`).
- Therefore, the translation fails: the compiled Lean code does not correspond to the natural language statement.

  - We fix a natural number n and a real n×n matrix A indexed by Fin n.
  - Hypothesis `h : A.transpose * A = 1` states that Aᵀ A equals the identity matrix (the defining property of an orthogonal matrix).
  - Conclusion: For all indices i, j in Fin n, the sum over k of A k i * A k j equals `if i = j then 1 else 0`. Here, `A k i` is the (k,i)-entry of A, so the expression `∑ k A k i * A k j` is exactly the dot product of the i-th and j-th columns of A. The right-hand side `if i = j then 1 else 0` is the Kronecker delta δ_ij.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- Natural language: For A ∈ O(n) with column vectors A₁,…,Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ, show that Aᵢ · Aⱼ = δ_{ij} for all i, j.
- The Lean hypothesis `Aᵀ * A = 1` matches the definition of an orthogonal matrix (element of O(n)).
- The Lean conclusion `∑ k A k i * A k j = if i = j then 1 else 0` is exactly the statement that the dot product of column i and column j equals δ_ij.
- Using Fin n indices and sums explicitly instead of a dot product symbol is a standard formalization of the dot product in ℝⁿ.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- The Lean statement is precisely the (i,j)-entrywise restatement of `Aᵀ A = I`. This is equivalent to the columns being orthonormal. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced. There are no extraneous or missing conditions; the only mild difference is that the formalization naturally allows n = 0 (vacuously true), which is a harmless generalization.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: given a permutation representation δ: G → S_n (i.e., a group homomorphism), one obtains a matrix representation ρ: G → GL_n(F) by sending g to the permutation matrix P_{δ(g)}. Crucially, “representation” means ρ is a group homomorphism into GL_n(F).
- Discrepancies:
  - δ is only a bare function `G → Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` in the Lean code, not a group homomorphism into S_n. The hypothesis that δ is a hom is missing.
  - The conclusion only asserts the existence of a function ρ into the units of the matrix ring whose underlying matrices are the permutation matrices. It does not assert that ρ is a group (or monoid) homomorphism, so it does not express that ρ is a representation.
  - Using `(Matrix ...)ˣ` instead of `GL_n(F)` is acceptable as a model for the general linear group in Lean, but the missing homomorphism structure is the essential gap.
  - The theorem is existential over functions ρ with the stated pointwise equality, which reduces to showing each permutation matrix is invertible. It does not encode the homomorphism property ρ(gh) = ρ(g) ρ(h).
- Minor convention issue (row/column placement of 1's) is harmless; either choice yields a hom if defined consistently. But that is moot since no homomorphism claim is made.

3) Final check:
- The Lean statement and the natural language statement are not the same. The Lean theorem is strictly weaker: it neither assumes δ is a group hom nor concludes ρ is a group hom. Hence it does not formalize “gives rise to a matrix representation.”

  Natural language: For any group G, any subgroups SO2 ≤ O2, and any element A ∈ O2 \ SO2, the subgroup generated by SO2 ∪ {A} equals O2.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement is specific to the concrete matrix group O(2) and its subgroup SO(2), and to any improper orthogonal matrix A (i.e., det(A) = −1). It asserts that O(2) is generated by SO(2) together with A.
- The Lean statement is a sweeping generalization: it claims that for any group G and any pair of subgroups SO2 ≤ O2, and any element A in the set difference O2 \ SO2, the closure of SO2 ∪ {A} is O2.
- This is not faithful: the general claim is false in many groups without additional structure (e.g., index-2, normality, semidirect product structure). The code does not mention orthogonal groups, determinants, or the specific structure of O(2). It replaces the concrete, true statement about O(2) by an unjustified universal group-theoretic assertion.

3) Final comparison and differences:

- Lean: for arbitrary G and subgroups O2, SO2 with SO2 ≤ O2 and any A ∈ O2 \ SO2, conclude O2 = ⟨SO2 ∪ {A}⟩.
- Differences: The Lean code omits the essential structural properties of O(2) and SO(2) and overgeneralizes to an assertion that is not implied by the original and is generally false.

  This states the right distributivity: ([b]+[c])*[a] = [b]*[a] + [c]*[a], under the same hypotheses.

- The natural language statement fixes an integer n > 1, and for all a, b, c in Z, with [x] the congruence class modulo n, proves left and right distributivity in Z/nZ.
- The Lean code takes n : Nat with hypothesis 1 < n, and a, b, c : Int, and asserts the equalities in ZMod n (which is Z/nZ). Casting `(x : ZMod n)` corresponds to taking the congruence class [x].
- The content exactly matches left and right distributivity of multiplication over addition in Z/nZ for integers a, b, c. The additional hypothesis 1 < n is consistent with “fix an integer n > 1”.

3) Final check and differences:
- Types: The natural statement says n is an integer > 1; Lean uses n : Nat with 1 < n. This is a standard and faithful formalization (positive integer greater than 1).

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem lean_env_smoke_test : (1 : ℤ) = 1 := by rfl`: States and proves the trivial equality that the integer 1 equals 1 by reflexivity.

This code only asserts a basic identity in the integers and serves as a smoke test that the environment compiles.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is about real vectors in R^2, a family of maps ρ_θ parameterized by θ ∈ R, and the angle between a nonzero vector X and its image ρ_θ(X). It claims that angle(X, ρ_θ(X)) = θ, hence ρ_θ is a rotation by θ. The provided Lean code does not mention R, R^2, angles, nonzero vectors, ρ_θ, or rotations. There is no attempted formalization of the concepts involved.

3) Final check:
The math problems are completely different. The Lean code proves a trivial identity about integers; the target statement concerns geometry in R^2 and rotation maps. There are no auxiliary definitions pretending to capture the intended notions; the code simply does something else.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def R (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix R_θ with entries:
  - R_θ(0,0) = cos θ, R_θ(0,1) = -sin θ, R_θ(1,0) = sin θ, R_θ(1,1) = cos θ. This is exactly the standard rotation matrix.
- `def H (θ : ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines the 2×2 real matrix H_θ with entries:
  - H_θ(0,0) = cos(2θ), H_θ(0,1) = sin(2θ), H_θ(1,0) = sin(2θ), H_θ(1,1) = -cos(2θ). This is the standard matrix for reflection across the line through the origin making angle θ with the x-axis, since the reflection matrix across a unit vector at angle θ is 2uuᵀ - I = [[cos 2θ, sin 2θ],[sin 2θ, -cos 2θ]].
- `def O2 : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { A | A.transpose * A = 1 }` defines O(2) as the set of 2×2 real matrices A such that Aᵀ A = I, which is the usual definition of the orthogonal group in dimension 2.
- `theorem O2_eq_range_R_union_range_H : O2 = (Set.range R) ∪ (Set.range H) := by sorry` states the equality of sets O(2) = {R_θ | θ ∈ ℝ} ∪ {H_θ | θ ∈ ℝ}, i.e., every orthogonal 2×2 matrix is either a rotation or a reflection (and conversely every rotation and every such reflection is orthogonal). The proof is omitted, but the statement is the desired equivalence.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says O(2) equals the union of the rotations R_θ and the reflections H_θ, with the explicit formulas provided. The Lean code defines exactly those matrices R and H and the set O2 by AᵀA = I, and asserts the equality O2 = range R ∪ range H. This matches the statement precisely.

3) Final check for differences:
- The mathematical objects match: R_θ and H_θ are defined exactly as in the statement; O(2) is defined in the standard way; the union uses Set.range, which corresponds to {R_θ : θ ∈ ℝ} and {H_θ : θ ∈ ℝ}.
- No vacuous or fake placeholders are used; all auxiliary definitions are concrete.
- The theorem statement is exactly the natural language statement, just formalized. Minor comment text mentions “SO(2)” for R_θ but the code never uses that as a definition; it does not affect the statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the statement.

- The natural statement: Prove that S_n is isomorphic (as groups) to the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL_n(F) via α ↦ P_α, where P_α is obtained by permuting the identity’s columns by α. This requires: (i) identifying the subgroup of GL_n(F) consisting of permutation matrices; (ii) giving a group isomorphism S_n ≃ that subgroup; (iii) the map α ↦ P_α; (iv) demonstrating that it is a group homomorphism (composition corresponds to matrix multiplication) and bijective.
- The code: It defines the same permutation matrices via the “columns permuted by σ” recipe, and sets up a bijection between S_n and the set of permutation matrices viewed as a subset of the ambient matrix type. However, it does not:
  - place these matrices inside GL_n(F) (the general linear group),
  - equip the target with a group structure or define it as a subgroup of GL_n(F),
  - state or prove that the map is a group isomorphism (it uses Equiv, not MulEquiv, and does not reference GL_n(F)).

3) Final check: same or different?
- Similarities: The map α ↦ permutation matrix P_α is the same and the set of permutation matrices is correctly captured. The definition of P_α matches “apply α to the columns of the identity.”
- Differences:
  - The natural statement is about a group isomorphism with a subgroup of GL_n(F); the code only provides a set-level bijection (Equiv) to a subset of all matrices, not a group-level isomorphism (no MulEquiv) and not a subgroup of GL_n(F).
  - The group structure and homomorphism property are not expressed in the code.

Conclusion: The translation is very close in spirit but misses the crucial group-structural aspect and the GL_n(F) context. Hence it is not fully faithful to the original statement.

This matches “represent r by a rotation matrix.” The hypothesis hn is present but not used; this is acceptable and harmless.
- def h (n : ℕ) (hn : 3 ≤ n) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...: Defines a 2×2 real matrix h equal to diag(1, -1), i.e., reflection across the horizontal axis. This matches “represent h by a suitable reflection matrix (across the horizontal axis).” Again hn is unused, which is fine.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The NL statement: For the dihedral group D_n (n ≥ 3), with r the rotation by 2π/n and h the reflection across the horizontal axis, prove r h r = h using matrices. The Lean code defines exactly these matrices (rotation by 2π/n and reflection across the horizontal axis) and states the equality r h r = h as a matrix identity for all n ≥ 3.
- The code does not define D_n explicitly, but the problem explicitly asks for an algebraic argument with matrices, so directly asserting the matrix identity is exactly in line with the requested approach.
- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions: r and h are concrete matrices; no fake predicates or dummy definitions. The only “incompleteness” is the proof is omitted via sorry, which is acceptable for auditing the statement’s faithfulness.
- Minor technical note: The hypothesis hn (3 ≤ n) is present but not actually required for the equality; this is a harmless strengthening and consistent with the original assumption n ≥ 3.

Final check: The Lean theorem precisely formalizes “R H R = H” for the intended rotation and reflection matrices. This is the same mathematical content as the NL statement’s requested identity. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

theorem srdoty_alg_abelian_420 : True := by sorry
",0,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library.
- The docstring explains the intended mathematical statement: the generating function for the partition numbers p(n) equals the infinite product ∏_{k=1}^∞ 1/(1 - x^k). It also says the file records the statement; proof omitted.
- `theorem srdoty_alg_abelian_420 : True := by sorry`: This declares a theorem named `srdoty_alg_abelian_420` whose statement is simply `True`. The proof is elided with `sorry` (a placeholder), meaning this is not proved but allowed as an admitted theorem.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The original statement asserts a specific identity of formal power series (or generating functions) involving the partition function p(n). The Lean code, however, does not state anything about partitions, generating functions, power series, sums, products, or p(n). It merely states the trivial proposition `True` and admits it with `sorry`. Therefore, it is not a translation of the intended statement.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same or different?
They are different. The natural language statement is a specific and nontrivial equality about generating functions; the Lean code states `True`. Additionally, the presence of `sorry` and the vacuous target `True` violate the guideline against vacuous placeholders. There are no auxiliary definitions that could salvage the intent.

Conclusion: The code is completely unrelated to the mathematical statement and fails to provide any faithful formalization.

The natural language statement: Let A ∈ O(n) with column vectors A₁, …, Aₙ ∈ ℝⁿ. Show that Aᵢᵀ Aⱼ = δᵢⱼ for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.

They are completely different. The Lean code does not attempt to formalize O(n), column vectors, or the delta condition. There are no auxiliary definitions relevant to the problem. Even if the `sorry` were replaced by a proof, the theorem remains unrelated to the original statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def O : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := { A | isOrthogonal A }`
  This defines O(n) as the set of n×n real matrices that are orthogonal.
- `def SO : Set (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) := { A | isOrthogonal A ∧ A.det = 1 }`
  This defines SO(n) as the set of orthogonal n×n real matrices with determinant 1.
- `theorem SO_normal_in_O {g h : Matrix ...} (hg : isOrthogonal g) (hh : isOrthogonal h) (hd : h.det = 1) : isOrthogonal (g ⬝ h ⬝ gᵀ) ∧ (g ⬝ h ⬝ gᵀ).det = 1 := by sorry`
  This states: if g is orthogonal and h is special orthogonal (i.e., orthogonal with det = 1), then the conjugate g h gᵀ is also special orthogonal (orthogonal and determinant 1). This is exactly the conjugation-invariance property needed to show normality of SO(n) in O(n), given the identification g⁻¹ = gᵀ for orthogonal g. It does not explicitly package SO as a subgroup or assert “normal” in Mathlib’s group-theoretic sense, but it states the key closure-under-conjugation property.
- `theorem O_quot_SO_eq_units_int : Prop := by sorry`
  This is a serious problem: it declares a theorem whose statement is just an arbitrary `Prop`. It does not encode the intended claim “O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^×” (units of ℤ, i.e., {±1}). It doesn’t reference O, SO, quotient, or units; it’s completely vacuous as a translation of the quotient-isomorphism statement.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- First part: “SO(n) ◁ O(n)”. The code includes a theorem that expresses the conjugation closure property: for g ∈ O(n) and h ∈ SO(n), g h gᵀ ∈ SO(n). This is the correct property underlying normality (assuming SO is a subgroup), so this part is essentially faithful, though not phrased in Mathlib’s subgroup/normal subgroup framework.
- Second part: “O(n)/SO(n) ≅ ℤ^×”. The code does not state this at all. The declared theorem has the meaningless type `Prop`. Therefore, this part is not translated.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The first half (normality) is captured up to a standard reformulation (closure under conjugation), which is acceptable. The second half (quotient isomorphism) is entirely missing/placeholder and thus not faithful.

Given the mixture—one part essentially correct, the other vacuous—the overall translation fails under the guidelines. The auxiliary definitions (O and SO) are legitimate, but the final quotient theorem is a vacuous placeholder. If that second theorem were properly stated (e.g., an isomorphism between the quotient and Units ℤ, perhaps via determinant sign), the translation would likely pass.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language asks to show that ρ_θ is rotation by θ about the origin: for any X ∈ R^2, ρ_θ(X) is obtained by rotating X by angle θ. The theorem articulates the characteristic property of rotation: in polar coordinates, the radius is preserved and the angle is increased by θ. Since every vector in R^2 can be written as (r cos φ, r sin φ) (with r ≥ 0; the statement even works for any real r), this exactly captures that ρ_θ rotates by θ about the origin.

3) Final check for differences:
- The code does not introduce the matrix R_θ explicitly, but defines the equivalent coordinate map—this is faithful.
- The theorem is expressed for vectors written as (r cos φ, r sin φ), which is a standard way to characterize rotation; since any vector admits such a representation, this is effectively universal. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present.

- `theorem srdoty_alg_abstract_gps_1108 : True := by trivial`: This declares and proves a theorem whose statement is simply `True`. The proof is `trivial`, meaning it does not encode any of the intended content.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is a specific group-theoretic identity in the symmetric group Sym_n: for n ≥ 2, with α = (1,2) and β = (1,2,...,n), and for any 1 < i < n, we have (i,i+1) = β^(i-1) α β^{-(i-1)} = β^(i-1) α β^{n-i+1}. The provided Lean code does not define Sym_n, α, β, n, i, permutations, powers, or conjugation, nor does it state or prove the claimed equality. It only proves `True`. Thus it is not a translation of the given statement.

3) Final check:
The mathematical problems are completely different: the code proves a tautology unrelated to the group-theoretic identity. No auxiliary definitions are present; the only theorem is vacuous and not a placeholder towards the intended result. Therefore, the translation fails.

Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- Module docstring explains the plan: express congruence modulo n as divisibility in Z, with n fixed positive and a,b,c : Int.

- `theorem congr_reflexive (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) (a : Int) : n ∣ (a - a) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any integer n with n > 0 and any integer a, n divides a − a. Since a − a = 0, this encodes a ≡ a (mod n) using the standard equivalence a ≡ b (mod n) ↔ n ∣ (a − b). The positivity assumption ensures n ≠ 0 (though not strictly needed here).

- `theorem congr_symm (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) {a b : Int} (h : n ∣ (a - b)) : n ∣ (b - a) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any integer n with n > 0 and integers a, b, if n divides a − b then n divides b − a. This encodes symmetry: if a ≡ b (mod n) then b ≡ a (mod n).

- `theorem congr_trans (n : Int) (hn : 0 < n) {a b c : Int} (hab : n ∣ (a - b)) (hbc : n ∣ (b - c)) : n ∣ (a - c) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any integer n with n > 0 and integers a, b, c, if n divides a − b and n divides b − c, then n divides a − c. This encodes transitivity: if a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n).

Faithfulness check:
- The natural language statement asserts reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of congruence modulo a fixed positive integer n on integers a, b, c.
- The code states exactly the divisibility reformulations of these properties for Int, with hypothesis 0 < n. This matches the standard equivalence of congruence modulo n with divisibility of differences when n ≠ 0 (positivity is a harmless and standard assumption).
- There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the theorems are stated directly, and the use of divisibility is a faithful formalization of congruence modulo n.

Final comparison:
- The mathematical content is the same: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of ≡ mod n, with n a fixed positive integer and a,b,c ∈ ℤ. The Lean code’s statements are a faithful restatement via divisibility. No discrepancies.

- `def rho (θ : ℝ) (x : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := (Real.cos θ * x.fst - Real.sin θ * x.snd, Real.sin θ * x.fst + Real.cos θ * x.snd)`: Defines the rotation operator ρ_θ on ℝ^2 (modeled as pairs ℝ × ℝ) by the standard rotation matrix action: (x, y) ↦ (cos θ x − sin θ y, sin θ x + cos θ y). This matches the usual R_θ X multiplication.
- `theorem rho_fix_origin (θ : ℝ) : rho θ (0, 0) = (0, 0) := by sorry`: States that for every real θ, applying ρ_θ to the origin (0,0) yields (0,0). The `sorry` is a placeholder for the proof but does not alter the statement.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The code defines exactly the rotation operator on ℝ^2 via the standard formula and then asserts that, for every θ, it fixes the origin. This directly corresponds to the natural language statement.

3) Final comparison:
- Natural language: For every θ ∈ ℝ, the rotation operator ρ_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2, defined by ρ_θ(X) = R_θ X, fixes the origin.
- Lean: For every θ, ρ_θ applied to (0,0) equals (0,0), with ρ_θ defined by the rotation matrix formula.
They are the same statement. No extraneous or vacuous auxiliary definitions are present; the function definition is legitimate and standard. The use of ℝ × ℝ for ℝ^2 is a standard formalization choice.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `def IsInternalDirectProduct {G : Type _} [Group G] {n : Nat} (H : Fin n → Subgroup G) : Prop := Function.Bijective fun f : ∀ i, H i => (List.ofFn fun i => (f i : G)).prod`
  This defines a predicate on a family of subgroups H indexed by `Fin n`. It asserts that the function which takes a tuple `f` of elements `f i ∈ H i` and maps it to the product in G (in the canonical order over `Fin n`) is bijective. In words: every element of G can be written uniquely as an ordered product of one element from each subgroup H i.

- `theorem internal_direct_product_disjoint ... : ∀ (i j : Fin n), i ≠ j → ∀ x, x ∈ H i → x ∈ H j → x = (1 : G) := by sorry`
  This states: assuming `IsInternalDirectProduct H`, for any distinct indices `i ≠ j`, if an element `x` belongs to both `H i` and `H j`, then `x` must be the identity. Equivalently, `H i ∩ H j` is trivial. No proof is provided (`sorry`), but we're only auditing the statement/translation.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language hypothesis says: G is the internal direct product of normal subgroups H1, ..., Hn. A standard formalization would be: the multiplication map from the external direct product ∏ H_i to G is an isomorphism of groups, which in particular implies the underlying function is bijective. The code captures a key consequence (and arguably the essence needed for the conclusion) by requiring only that the raw multiplication map from the tuple type `∀ i, H i` to G is bijective. It does not require the map to be a homomorphism (nor that the subgroups are normal or pairwise commuting).
- The conclusion in the natural language is: for i ≠ j, Hi ∩ Hj = {1}. The Lean theorem states exactly the pointwise version: for i ≠ j, any element in both is the identity, which is equivalent to the intersection being {1}, since subgroups contain 1.

3) Are they the same problem?
- The Lean hypotheses are weaker: the definition `IsInternalDirectProduct` assumes only that the (ordered) multiplication map is bijective; it does not assume normality (or commutativity) of the factors, nor that the map is a homomorphism. However, the natural-language assumption (internal direct product of normal subgroups) implies bijectivity of this multiplication map, so the Lean hypothesis is implied by the original hypothesis. The conclusion in Lean is exactly the desired trivial intersection. Therefore, the Lean statement is a valid slight generalization of the original statement and faithfully captures the intended result.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the custom predicate is legitimate and uses standard Mathlib constructs; there are no fake `True`-style placeholders.

Overall: The translation is faithful in essence (indeed slightly stronger), with the only difference being omission of normality, which is not needed for the stated conclusion.

- `open Complex`: Open the Complex namespace to use `I` (imaginary unit) and `conj` (complex conjugation).
- `theorem polarization_identity (z w : Complex) : ... := by sorry`: States a theorem for all complex numbers `z, w`.
- Left-hand side: `(4 : Complex) * z * conj w` means 4 times z times the complex conjugate of w, i.e., 4 z \bar{w}.
- Right-hand side first difference: `(z + w) * conj (z + w) - (z - w) * conj (z - w)` equals |z+w|^2 − |z−w|^2, since |s|^2 = s conj s.
- Plus imaginary part: `+ I * ((z + I * w) * conj (z + I * w) - (z - I * w) * conj (z - I * w))` equals i ( |z+iw|^2 − |z−iw|^2 ), again using s conj s to represent |s|^2, and with `I` denoting i.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement is exactly the polarization identity. It expresses each squared modulus |·|^2 as s * conj s in ℂ, which is standard and faithful. The entire equality is an identity in ℂ, matching the natural language statement. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions—just the theorem statement (with proof omitted via `sorry`, which is allowed for translation auditing).

This code asserts a trivial equality in the natural numbers and provides no definitions or context about real numbers, matrices, or rotations.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
The original statement concerns 2×2 real matrices depending on a real parameter θ: it asserts that for each θ ∈ ℝ, the matrix H_θ equals the product H_0 R_{-2θ}, where H_0 is the diagonal matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]] and R_φ is the rotation matrix [[cos φ, −sin φ], [sin φ, cos φ]]. This involves linear algebra over ℝ, matrix multiplication, and trigonometric functions.

The Lean code does not mention ℝ, matrices, H_θ, H_0, R_φ, cos, sin, or any related structures. It only states `(1 : ℕ) = 1`. Thus it is entirely unrelated to the given statement. Moreover, it contains `sorry` (an incomplete proof), but even if the proof were completed, the content would still be unrelated.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean theorem is about equality of a natural number with itself; the natural language statement is about identities of 2×2 real matrices parameterized by θ. There is no overlap. Therefore, the translation fails completely.

- The natural language claim is: For every θ ∈ ℝ, the matrix [[cos θ, −sin θ], [sin θ, cos θ]] is in SO(2).
- The Lean code defines exactly that matrix as R θ and defines SO2 as the standard special orthogonal group in dimension 2 over ℝ. The theorem asserts R θ ∈ SO2 for all θ. This is a direct and faithful formalization of the statement.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary vacuous or placeholder definitions; R and SO2 are concrete and standard.
- Using M ⬝ transpose M = 1 is equivalent to orthogonality in ℝ; determinant condition matches det = 1.

- `ConformalAt f z₀` is the standard angle-preserving notion at a point in ℝ² ≅ ℂ. For a complex-differentiable map, this is equivalent to `deriv f z₀ ≠ 0`.
- The code assumes differentiability at z₀ rather than global holomorphy; this is a mild generalization of the hypothesis that is standard and sufficient for the equivalence at the point. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The mathematical content matches: both assert the equivalence between conformality at z₀ and nonvanishing derivative at z₀, under the assumption of complex differentiability at z₀.

- def block_matrix (A B C : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) F) : Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) F := Matrix.fromBlocks A B 0 C: This builds a 4×4 block matrix with 2×2 blocks in the form [[A, B], [0, C]]. This matches the natural-language description of the block form.
- def G_units : Set (Units (Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) F)) := { u | ∃ A B C, (u : Matrix ...) = block_matrix A B C ∧ Matrix.det (A ⬝ C) ≠ 0 }: This defines G as a set of invertible 4×4 matrices (units in the matrix ring), consisting precisely of those whose underlying 4×4 matrix is of the specified block upper-triangular form with the condition det(AC) ≠ 0. The condition det(A ⬝ C) is exactly det(AC). Since det(AC) ≠ 0 implies A and C are invertible and hence the 4×4 block matrix is invertible, this characterization is equivalent to the natural-language G.
- theorem G_is_subgroup : IsSubgroup (G_units : Set (Units (Matrix ...))) := by sorry: This asserts that G (as defined) forms a subgroup under multiplication in the ambient group Units(Matrix ...). This corresponds to verifying that G is a matrix group under multiplication.
Faithfulness check:
- The essential mathematical content matches: the set G consists of 4×4 block upper-triangular matrices with blocks A, B, C over F and det(AC) ≠ 0. The code models G as a subset of Units of the matrix ring, which is a standard way to formalize “matrix groups” in Lean/mathlib. The det(AC) ≠ 0 condition is present and aligns with the statement.
- The group operation is multiplication (in Units), which corresponds to matrix multiplication of invertible matrices.
- Minor technical difference: The code’s G lives in Units(Matrix ...) rather than Matrix ..., but this is a conventional formalization and is essentially equivalent since det(AC) ≠ 0 ensures the 4×4 matrix is invertible. So the set of such matrices corresponds bijectively to the set of such units.
- Note: The predicate IsSubgroup is likely not the standard mathlib4 API (mathlib4 uses Subgroup α or a structure rather than IsSubgroup on a Set), which is a red flag with respect to using the latest Mathlib terms. However, this affects style/implementation, not the mathematical meaning being asserted. The definitions themselves are non-vacuous and faithful.
Final comparison:
- Both problems describe the same mathematical object and claim: the set of 4×4 block upper-triangular matrices with det(AC) ≠ 0 forms a group under multiplication. The Lean code states exactly this (modulo the ambient type Units and the nonstandard IsSubgroup name). No auxiliary definition is vacuous.
- Therefore, the translation is essentially faithful, though slightly non-idiomatic wrt current mathlib naming.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:

- Lean formalization: Uses f : ℂ → ℂ with differentiability restricted to U (DifferentiableOn ℂ f U), which is a standard and faithful formalization of “f is holomorphic on U.” The local maximum condition is expressed as the existence of r > 0 such that ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖f z0‖ for all z in U ∩ ball(z0, r), matching the subspace-topology notion of local maximum at z0. The conclusion produces r' > 0 with f constant on U ∩ ball(z0, r'), which is exactly “constant in a neighborhood of z0.”

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The only slight difference is domain modeling: Lean takes f defined on all ℂ but only assumed differentiable on U, which is a standard, harmless generalization equivalent to the intended setting.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib, giving access to complex numbers, hyperbolic functions, absolute values, etc.
- The docstring mirrors the natural language statement: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |tanh z| ≤ tanh |Re z|.
- `theorem tanh_abs_le_tanh_abs_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.tanh z) ≤ Real.tanh (abs z.re) := by sorry`
  This asserts: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of tanh z is less than or equal to the real tanh of the absolute value of the real part of z. Here, `Complex.abs (Complex.tanh z)` is |tanh z|, and `Real.tanh (abs z.re)` is tanh(|Re z|). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable here since we're only auditing the statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |tanh z| ≤ tanh |Re z|.”
- Lean: Exactly the same inequality, with the correct interpretations of absolute value (complex modulus on the left, real absolute value on the argument to Real.tanh on the right) and the real part `Re z`.

Step 3: Final check and differences.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; no vacuous placeholders. The theorem statement is a direct formalization of the natural language claim.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement asks to show R_{2θ} H_0 R_{2θ} = H_0 for all θ ∈ ℝ with the given matrices. The Lean code defines exactly those matrices and asserts the same identity for all θ. The multiplication is standard matrix multiplication. Hence, the formal statement matches the natural language statement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only stylistic difference is using a custom Mat2 structure rather than Mathlib's matrix type, but the definitions are concrete and faithful (no placeholders). The angle is exactly 2θ as in the statement. The theorem matches the equation precisely. There are no vacuous definitions. The presence of `sorry` only omits the proof, which is allowed per the instructions; it does not affect the statement's faithfulness.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the given statement.

- `example : Group ( { M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ // M ∈ G'_set } ) := by sorry` asserts there exists a group structure on the subtype of matrices lying in G'. No specific multiplication is stipulated in the formal statement; the comment says it's under matrix multiplication.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement asks to prove that G' is a group under matrix multiplication. The code correctly defines G and G'. However, the final statement merely asserts that the subtype `{M // M ∈ G'_set}` admits some group structure, without encoding that the group operation is the restriction of matrix multiplication (and that inv is the usual matrix inverse on this set). In Lean, `Group (Subtype ...)` by itself does not tie the group operation to the ambient matrix multiplication unless it is explicitly constructed that way (e.g., via a `Subgroup` of an ambient `Group` or by defining `mul := fun x y => ⟨x.1 ⬝ y.1, ...⟩`, etc.). Since the ambient type `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ` is only a monoid (not a group), there is no automatic inheritance ensuring this is the “under matrix multiplication” group. Thus, the formal statement is weaker/ambiguous: it could endow the subtype with an arbitrary group law, not necessarily the matrix multiplication law.

No vacuous placeholders are present in the definitions; they are legitimate. The mismatch is specifically that the theorem statement does not specify the group operation is matrix multiplication restricted to G'. A more faithful formalization would either:
- define a `Subgroup` of `GeneralLinearGroup` or of `Matrix` with a specified multiplication and inverse, or
- explicitly define the `Group` structure on the subtype using the matrix multiplication and inverse formulas, or
- state closure and existence of inverses under the ambient multiplication directly.

3) Final check:
- Natural language: ""G' is a group under matrix multiplication.""
- Lean: ""There exists a group structure on the subtype of G'.""
Difference: the Lean statement does not enforce the group law to be the ambient matrix multiplication. Therefore, they are not the same.

  Natural language rendering:
  Given an open set U ⊆ ℂ and a function f : ℂ → ℂ, assume hf which is merely True (no content), and assume hder which says for all z ∈ U, True (again no content). Then for every z0 ∈ U, there exists an open set V with z0 ∈ V and V ⊆ U such that f is injective (globally, i.e., Injective f on all of ℂ).

2) Assessment versus the natural language statement:
- The original statement: U ⊆ ℂ open; f : U → ℂ holomorphic; f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U; conclude: f is locally injective on U (i.e., for each z0 ∈ U, there exists an open V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U such that the restriction of f to V is injective, equivalently InjOn f V).
- Mismatches:
  - Domain: The code has f : ℂ → ℂ, not f : U → ℂ. In Mathlib, one could work with f : ℂ → ℂ together with DifferentiableOn/HolomorphicOn on U, but the code does not provide these; instead it uses hf : True.
  - Holomorphic assumption: Replaced by hf : True (vacuous), not a legitimate Mathlib predicate such as Complex.HolomorphicOn or DifferentiableOn.
  - Nonvanishing derivative: Replaced by hder : ∀ z ∈ U, True (vacuous), not a real derivative condition like Complex.deriv f z ≠ 0 under differentiability.
  - Conclusion: The code concludes the existence of an open V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U and Injective f (global injectivity of f), rather than local injectivity on V (InjOn f V). This is substantially stronger and not equivalent to the intended claim. Moreover, the existence of V is irrelevant to the global Injective f asserted.

3) Final check: The two math problems are different.
- The code uses vacuous assumptions (True) instead of meaningful holomorphicity and nonzero derivative conditions, violating faithful translation.
- The conclusion is incorrect: it asserts global injectivity of f rather than injectivity of f restricted to some neighborhood V (InjOn f V), which is the essence of ""locally injective"".
- The domain mismatch (f : ℂ → ℂ rather than f : U → ℂ) is acceptable only if handled via restrictions and proper predicates, which is not done here.
Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` just imports the library.
- `variable (holomorphic_on : Set Complex → (Complex → Complex) → Prop)` introduces a completely generic predicate named `holomorphic_on` with the given type. It is not Mathlib’s notion of holomorphicity (e.g., `AnalyticOn`, `DifferentiableOn ℂ`, etc.), so this is a placeholder.
- `variable (not_constant_on : Set Complex → (Complex → Complex) → Prop)` similarly introduces a placeholder for “not constant on.” Not a Mathlib definition.
- `variable (deriv_at : (Complex → Complex) → Complex → Complex)` is a placeholder for the derivative at a point, not Mathlib’s `deriv` or `derivWithin`.
- `variable (zero_order : (Complex → Complex) → Complex → Nat → Prop)` is a placeholder for “has zero of order m at z0.” Not Mathlib’s `orderOfZero` nor any standard predicate.

The theorem statement:
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_2718 {U : Set Complex} {f : Complex → Complex} {z0 c : Complex}`: Universes and variables as expected.
- Hypotheses:
  - `(h_hol : holomorphic_on U f)` means “f is holomorphic on U” but uses a placeholder predicate.
  - `(h_not_const : not_constant_on U f)` means “f is not constant on U” but also a placeholder.
  - `(h_val : f z0 = c)` means “f(z0) = c.”
  - `(h_deriv0 : deriv_at f z0 = 0)` means “the derivative of f at z0 is 0,” but via a placeholder derivative.
- Conclusion:
  - `(∀ z, f z = c)` states “f is identically c on all of ℂ,” not just on U. This is stronger than the natural language which only asserts equality on U.
  - `∨ (∃ (m : Nat), 1 ≤ m ∧ zero_order (fun z => f z - c) z0 m ∧ ∃ (V : Set Complex), z0 ∈ V ∧ True)` states: there exists m ≥ 1 such that f − c has a zero of order m at z0 (using a placeholder predicate), and there exists a set V containing z0, with the only property being `True` (completely vacuous). There is no statement that V is a neighborhood, nor any statement about the structure of `f^{-1}(c) ∩ V` or counting multiplicities.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let U be a domain (open and connected), f holomorphic and non-constant. If f(z0)=c and f′(z0)=0, then either f(z)=c for all z in U, or (if z0 is a zero of order m of f−c) there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicities).

Discrepancies:
1. Placeholders for key analytic notions: `holomorphic_on`, `not_constant_on`, `deriv_at`, `zero_order` are arbitrary variables, not Mathlib concepts. This is a major red flag per the guidelines.
2. The second part of the conclusion is vacuous: `∃ V, z0 ∈ V ∧ True` says nothing about V being a neighborhood, nor about the structure of the preimage or multiplicities. It completely misses the central claim about the local counting of roots/preimages.
3. The first disjunct asserts `∀ z, f z = c` on all ℂ rather than on U. This is stronger and does not match the original statement.
4. No encoding of “U is a domain” (open and connected). No condition that V is open or small enough, and no content about multiplicities.
5. The logical structure changes: the original states: either f is constant on U, or if z0 is a zero of order m, then the local preimage counting statement holds. The code asserts existence of m and a vacuous V, which does not capture the intended conditional or conclusion.

Final check:
- The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It relies on placeholder predicates, replaces the crucial local preimage statement with `True`, and incorrectly globalizes the constancy conclusion to all ℂ, not just U. Even if the placeholders were replaced by valid Mathlib notions, the theorem’s conclusion would still be incorrect because it lacks the neighborhood and counting property and misstates the domain of constancy.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous/placeholder definitions and a fundamentally incorrect/empty second conclusion. Even fixing placeholders would not salvage faithfulness. This aligns with a low score per the rubric.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `def G : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { M | IsUnit M ∧ M (1) (0) = 0 }`
  This defines G as the set of all 2×2 real matrices that are invertible (IsUnit) and whose entry in the second row, first column is zero; i.e., all invertible upper-triangular matrices of the form [[a, b], [0, c]]. This matches the intended description of matrices of the form [[a, b], [0, c]] taken as a subset of GL(2, R).

- `def N : Set (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) := { M | IsUnit M ∧ M 0 0 = 1 ∧ M 1 1 = 1 ∧ M 1 0 = 0 }`
  This defines N as the set of all 2×2 real matrices that are invertible and have diagonal entries equal to 1 and lower-left entry 0, i.e., matrices of the form [[1, b], [0, 1]]. The IsUnit condition is redundant here (since det = 1), but consistent.

- `theorem G_subgroup : ...` states three properties:
  1) The identity matrix is in G.
  2) Closure: If A, B ∈ G then A*B is invertible and has lower-left entry 0; equivalently A*B ∈ G.
  3) Inverses: For each A ∈ G there exists B with A*B = 1 = B*A, B invertible, and B has lower-left entry 0; equivalently B ∈ G and is the inverse of A.
  Altogether, this is precisely the subgroup axioms for G within GL(2, R).

- `theorem N_normal : ...` states:
  1) The identity matrix is in N.
  2) Closure: If X, Y ∈ N then X*Y is invertible and has diagonal entries 1 and lower-left entry 0; i.e., X*Y ∈ N.
  3) Inverses: For X ∈ N there exists Y with X*Y = 1 = Y*X, Y invertible with diagonal entries 1 and lower-left 0; i.e., Y ∈ N and is X^{-1}.
  4) Normality: For all g ∈ G and n ∈ N, there exists an inverse g_inv of g such that g*n*g_inv ∈ N; equivalently, N is closed under conjugation by elements of G. Note: they quantify the existence of g^{-1} explicitly instead of using notation g^{-1}, which is acceptable.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language asks to show G (upper triangular 2×2 real matrices) is a subgroup of GL(2), which the code captures by defining G as invertible matrices with lower-left entry 0 and then stating the subgroup axioms.
- It then defines N as the set of [[1, b], [0, 1]] and asks to prove N is a normal subgroup of G. The code defines N accordingly (with IsUnit and the entry constraints) and proves subgroup axioms and normality under conjugation by elements of G.
- While GL(2) is not modeled as a separate type, the use of IsUnit for invertibility faithfully reflects GL(2, R). The inclusion N ⊆ G is implicit from the definitions (N imposes stronger constraints than G), aligning with the usual setup.

Step 3: Final comparison for differences.
- Minor presentational differences: using IsUnit instead of GL(2, R) type; stating normality via existence of an inverse rather than using g^{-1} notation; adding IsUnit hypotheses redundantly in N. None of these change the mathematical content.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; everything uses real Mathlib notions.
- The statements exactly capture the subgroup and normal subgroup claims required.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the natural language problem.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.

- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_18541 (z w : Complex) (h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w) : ... := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for complex numbers `z` and `w` under the hypothesis `h` that `|z| = |w|`. The statement to be proved is an equivalence:
  `Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w) ↔ Complex.re (z * Complex.conj w) = 0`.
  In words: Given complex numbers z and w with equal modulus, we have that |z + w| equals |z − w| if and only if the real part of z times the conjugate of w is zero.

Step 2: Assess if this matches the natural language statement.
The natural language statement: ""Prove that if z, w ∈ ℂ and |z| = |w|, then |z + w| = |z − w| if and only if z \bar{w} is purely imaginary.""
- The hypothesis `|z| = |w|` matches `h : Complex.abs z = Complex.abs w`.
- The equality `|z + w| = |z − w|` matches `Complex.abs (z + w) = Complex.abs (z - w)`.
- ""z \bar{w} is purely imaginary"" is equivalent to `Re(z \bar{w}) = 0`, which matches `Complex.re (z * Complex.conj w) = 0`.
Thus, the code faithfully states exactly the intended equivalence under the given hypothesis.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no vacuous placeholders.
- The mathematical content precisely matches the original statement, including the condition and the biconditional.
- The interpretation of ""purely imaginary"" as having zero real part is standard and correct.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This asserts: for any complex number z, the modulus of sin z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z; i.e., |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_half_exp_abs (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  This asserts: for any complex number z, the modulus of cos z is at most (1/2) times exp of the modulus of z; i.e., |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language states: For z ∈ C, prove |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems exactly assert these two inequalities for all z: they are universally quantified by `(z : Complex)` and use Complex.abs for |·| and Real.exp for e^{·}. This matches precisely.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given (proofs omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable for translation auditing).
- Notation and constants correspond correctly: Complex.abs = |·|, Real.exp = e^{·}, factor 1/2 as a real number, sin and cos are the complex versions.
- No generalization or specialization beyond the original statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- import Mathlib: Using Mathlib.
- variable (n : Nat): Fix a natural number n.
- def GL : Type _ := Units (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ): Define GL(n) as the group of units (invertible elements) in the algebra of n×n real matrices, i.e., the general linear group over ℝ.
- def SL (g : GL n) : Prop := Matrix.det g.val = 1: Define SL(n) as the predicate on GL(n) consisting of those elements whose determinant equals 1 (i.e., special linear group as a subset/predicate, not as a Subgroup object).
- theorem SL_normal (g A : GL n) (h : SL n A) : SL n (g * A * g⁻¹) := by ...: States that if A has determinant 1, then any conjugate g A g^{-1} also has determinant 1. This captures conjugation-invariance of the set SL(n).
- theorem GL_mod_SL_equiv_R_units : ∃ (φ : GL n →* Units ℝ), Function.Surjective φ ∧ ∀ A, φ A = 1 ↔ Matrix.det A.val = 1 := by ...: Asserts that there exists a surjective group homomorphism from GL(n) to the unit group of ℝ (ℝˣ) whose kernel is exactly the set of elements with determinant 1. This is exactly the determinant map viewed as a hom to ℝˣ, characterized by surjectivity and kernel = SL(n).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- First part: “SL(n) ◁ GL(n).” The Lean theorem SL_normal shows conjugation-invariance of the determinant-1 set. Normality requires H be a subgroup and be invariant under conjugation; here, SL is only given as a predicate, and the theorem proves invariance under conjugation. The subgroup property is not stated here. However, the second theorem identifies SL as the kernel of a homomorphism, which automatically makes it a (normal) subgroup. So, taken together, the code captures that SL is a normal subgroup of GL. The statement is split across two results but is mathematically correct in content.
- Second part: “GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝ^{×}.” The second theorem asserts existence of a surjective hom φ : GL(n) → ℝˣ with kernel SL(n). By the First Isomorphism Theorem, this implies GL(n)/SL(n) ≅ ℝˣ. However, the Lean code does not explicitly state the quotient group isomorphism; it stops at the surjective hom with the specified kernel. So the isomorphism is an immediate corollary in Mathlib but is not explicitly formalized in this snippet.

Step 3: Final comparison for discrepancies.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions: GL and SL are defined meaningfully (no placeholders like True). Theorems contain sorrys in proofs, but that’s acceptable here since we’re auditing statement faithfulness, not proofs.
- Use of ℝ^{×} as Units ℝ is correct.
- Minor discrepancy: The normality claim is expressed as conjugation-invariance of the predicate SL, not as a Normal Subgroup structure; subgrouphood is only implicit via the kernel description in the second theorem, and the quotient isomorphism is not explicitly stated, only implied via the first isomorphism theorem.

Conclusion: The translation is very close. It captures the core mathematical content: SL is normal in GL (via kernel of determinant and conjugation-invariance), and the determinant induces a surjective hom to ℝˣ with kernel SL, from which GL/SL ≅ ℝˣ follows. The only shortcoming is that the quotient isomorphism is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it is almost faithful but not literally the same statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- variable (a b : ℝ): We fix real numbers a and b.
- def M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ := ...: Defines the 2×2 complex matrix M = [[a, -b], [b, a]] (with a, b coerced to ℂ). This is the standard matrix representing the complex number a + i b.
- def v_plus : Fin 2 → ℂ := ...: Defines the vector v_plus = [1, -i].
- def v_minus : Fin 2 → ℂ := ...: Defines the vector v_minus = [1, i].
- lemma M_mul_v_plus: States componentwise that M ⋅ v_plus = (a + i b) v_plus, i.e., for each i in Fin 2, ∑_j M i j * v_plus j = ((a:ℂ) + I * (b:ℂ)) * v_plus i. This is exactly the eigenvector equation for eigenvalue a + i b and eigenvector [1, -i].
- lemma M_mul_v_minus: Similarly states M ⋅ v_minus = (a − i b) v_minus, so a − i b is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1, i].

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts that the 2×2 matrix representing a + i b has eigenvalues a ± i b with corresponding eigenvectors [1; ∓ i]. The code defines the correct matrix [[a, -b], [b, a]] and the correct vectors [1, -i] and [1, i], and then states the eigenvector equations for each. This is a faithful formalization of “M has two eigenvalues a ± i b with those corresponding eigenvectors.”

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code uses complex-valued matrices and vectors and states the eigenvector property componentwise via sums, which is a standard and equivalent formalization.
- It does not explicitly assert that the eigenvectors are nonzero, but the given vectors [1, ± i] are obviously nonzero, and the eigen-equation is the core content.
- It does not assert “only these” eigenvalues, but the original statement merely identifies the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, not uniqueness/exhaustiveness. 
Thus, the formal statement matches the mathematical meaning.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library. No issue here.
- Comment lines: Indicate an intended statement about holomorphic implying analytic, but comments do not affect the formal content.
- `theorem holomorphic_implies_analytic {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : True) : True := by sorry`
  - This declares a theorem with parameters: a set `U ⊆ ℂ`, a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
  - Hypothesis `hf : True`: a vacuous hypothesis that carries no mathematical content.
  - Conclusion `True`: also vacuous.
  - `by sorry`: an omitted proof placeholder. Even aside from the vacuity, the proof is missing.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If `f : U → ℂ` is holomorphic on a domain `U`, then `f` is analytic; at each `z0 ∈ U`, `f` has a Taylor series converging on the disk of radius equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the series sums to `f`.
- The Lean code does not mention holomorphic functions, analyticity, domains, Taylor series, radii of convergence, or singularities. It does not assert any relationship between `f` and `U`; it simply states `True → True`.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the single theorem is entirely vacuous and unrelated to the mathematical content. The use of `sorry` further indicates the statement is not even proven, but more importantly, the statement itself is not the intended claim.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code asserts a tautology `True → True` with no reference to holomorphicity, analyticity, or Taylor expansions, whereas the natural language statement is a substantive theorem in complex analysis with precise content about Taylor series and radius of convergence.
- Key differences:
  - Missing hypotheses: holomorphic on a domain `U`.
  - Missing conclusions: existence of Taylor series, radius equals distance to nearest singularity, convergence, and equality to `f`.
  - Vacuous hypothesis and conclusion (`True`).
  - Omitted proof (`sorry`).

Given these discrepancies, the translation is completely unfaithful.

  This states: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of the complex cosine of z is greater than or equal to the complex modulus of the complex cosine of the complex number obtained by coercing the real part of z into the complex numbers. Equivalently, for all z ∈ ℂ, |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|, interpreting both cos and absolute value as the complex versions; since Re z is real, `Complex.cos (z.re : Complex)` is the real cosine value viewed in ℂ, and `Complex.abs` of a real number equals its real absolute value.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ, show that |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|. The Lean theorem precisely captures this, using the complex absolute value and complex cosine; on real inputs these agree with the real cosine and real absolute value, so there is no mismatch in meaning.

The two statements are the same mathematically. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The presence of `sorry` indicates no proof, but we are auditing the statement, not the proof. Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Comparison:
- The Lean statement assumes p is holomorphic on the open ball and nonconstant on that ball, and p(z0) ≠ 0. This matches (and slightly generalizes) the original, since a polynomial or a power series converging on the ball defines a holomorphic function on the ball.
- Nonconstant on the ball matches the intended “nonconstant power series converging in the ball” (and is implied by nonconstant polynomial globally).
- The conclusion exactly matches: existence of w in the open ball with strictly smaller modulus |p(w)|.

Step 3: Final check of equivalence and differences.
- Domain of p: Lean allows any holomorphic function on the ball, not necessarily arising from a polynomial or explicit power series. This is a legitimate slight generalization consistent with the original’s “or more generally” phrasing.
- All auxiliary predicates (IsHolomorphicOn, IsConstOn, Metric.ball) are standard Mathlib-like notions; no vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced.
- The set in which w is found and the inequality are exactly as stated.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The theorem integral_of_holomorphic_in_parameter takes:
  - U : Set ℂ with hU : IsOpen U, matching “U ⊂ ℂ is open”.
  - psi : ℂ × ℝ → ℂ, a function of two real variables (z, t). Although psi is defined on all ℂ × ℝ, its properties are only assumed on U × [0,1], which is standard to model a function defined on a subset.
  - hpsi_cont : ContinuousOn psi (U × Icc 0 1), i.e., psi is continuous on U × [0,1]. This matches the hypothesis “ψ is continuous on U × [0,1]”.
  - hpsi_holo : ∀ t ∈ [0,1], HolomorphicOn (fun z => psi (z, t)) U, i.e., for each fixed t in [0,1], z ↦ ψ(z, t) is holomorphic on U. This matches the second hypothesis.
- Conclusion: HolomorphicOn (fun z => intervalIntegral.integral (fun t => psi (z, t)) 0 1) U, i.e., the function z ↦ ∫_0^1 ψ(z, t) dt is holomorphic on U. The integral used is the interval integral over [0,1]; for continuous integrands this coincides with the usual integral.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The mathematical content is the same: continuity on U × [0,1], holomorphy in z for each fixed t, and the conclusion that the parameter integral in t is holomorphic in z on U. The Lean use of ContinuousOn on a subset and of intervalIntegral is the standard formalization of the given assumptions and conclusion.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- psi’s domain is globally ℂ × ℝ in Lean but only assumed continuous on U × [0,1]; this is a faithful formalization of a function originally defined only on that subset.
- The interval is [0,1] in both statements (Lean uses Set.Icc 0 1 and intervalIntegral from 0 to 1).
- The presence of hU : IsOpen U aligns with the natural statement; although HolomorphicOn doesn’t require openness formally, including it matches the hypothesis and does not change the meaning.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions are standard Mathlib ones.
- Using Lebesgue intervalIntegral rather than Riemann integral is acceptable since continuity on a compact interval ensures equivalence.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. There are no generalization/specialization discrepancies, no hidden assumptions, and no vacuous or placeholder definitions. Although the proofs are omitted (`sorry`), this does not affect the faithfulness of the statement translation itself per the auditing guidelines.

- `import Mathlib`: Brings in the math library; no mathematical content change.
- Comment: Accurately paraphrases the intended statement.
- `theorem complex_abs_cos_ge_abs_cos_re (z : ℂ) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos (z.re : ℂ)) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any complex number z, the complex modulus of cos(z) is at least the complex modulus of cos(Re z), where Re z is regarded as a real number coerced into ℂ before applying the complex cosine and then taking complex absolute value.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: For z ∈ ℂ, |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
- The Lean statement exactly matches this: it quantifies over z : ℂ, uses Complex.cos for both terms, and coerces z.re : ℝ into ℂ on the right. Since for real inputs, Complex.cos agrees with Real.cos and Complex.abs of a real complex number equals the real absolute value, the formal statement is the same as the natural one.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem is stated directly.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Direction of inequality (≥) matches.
- Use of complex absolute value on the right matches the real absolute value via coercion equivalence.
- Thus, there is no discrepancy; the statements are the same.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem schwarz_lemma_special {f : ℂ → ℂ} ... : abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1 := ...`
  This states: For a function f from ℂ to ℂ, under the following assumptions, the modulus of the (complex) derivative of f at 0 is at most 1.
- Hypothesis `hf : IsHolomorphicOn f (ball (0 : ℂ) 1)` means: f is holomorphic on the open unit disk D = {z : |z| < 1}.
- Hypothesis `hmap : ∀ z ∈ ball (0 : ℂ) 1, f z ∈ ball (0 : ℂ) 1` means: f maps the open unit disk into itself, i.e., f(D) ⊆ D.
- Hypothesis `h0 : f 0 = 0` means: f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion `abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1` means: the complex modulus of the complex derivative f′(0) is ≤ 1.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement is: Suppose f : D → D is holomorphic and f(0) = 0; then |f′(0)| ≤ 1. The Lean statement assumes f is holomorphic on D, maps D into D, and vanishes at 0, and concludes |f′(0)| ≤ 1. This matches the Schwarz lemma inequality precisely.

3) Final comparison:
- Domain/codomain: The Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ but only assumes holomorphy and the mapping property on D. This is a standard and faithful formalization of f : D → D, since any function on D can be regarded as a function on ℂ with arbitrary values outside D.
- Holomorphy: `IsHolomorphicOn f (ball 0 1)` matches “f is holomorphic on D”.
- Mapping property: `∀ z ∈ ball 0 1, f z ∈ ball 0 1` matches “f : D → D”.
- Base point: `f 0 = 0` matches exactly.
- Conclusion: `abs (deriv f 0) ≤ 1` matches |f′(0)| ≤ 1.
No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. The slight implementation detail that f is defined on ℂ rather than just D is a benign and standard formalization choice, not a change in meaning.

Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `abs_csc_le_abs_csc_re` and states: for any complex number `z`, if `Complex.sin z ≠ 0` and `Complex.sin (z.re : Complex) ≠ 0` (these hypotheses ensure the cosecants are defined as inverses), then `Complex.abs ((Complex.sin z)⁻¹) ≤ Complex.abs ((Complex.sin (z.re : Complex))⁻¹)`. Interpreting `(Complex.sin z)⁻¹` as `csc z`, this says `|csc z| ≤ |csc (Re z)|` under the non-vanishing assumptions. There are no auxiliary (possibly vacuous) definitions; it’s a direct theorem statement (proof omitted).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: For all `z ∈ ℂ`, `|csc z| ≥ |csc (Re z)|`. The Lean statement asserts the opposite inequality: `|csc z| ≤ |csc (Re z)|`. Thus, the direction of the inequality is reversed.
- The Lean code includes hypotheses that `sin z ≠ 0` and `sin (Re z) ≠ 0`. The natural statement does not mention these, but typically such conditions are implicit because `csc` is undefined where `sin` is zero. These technical hypotheses are acceptable and do not materially change the claim; they merely ensure well-definedness. However, the inequality direction mismatch is substantive.

3) Final comparison:
- Core discrepancy: The inequality direction is reversed (≤ in Lean vs ≥ in the statement). This makes the formal statement not faithful to the original claim.
- Aside from that, the formalization choices (expressing csc as inverse of sin, coercing `Re z` to `Complex`, and assuming nonzero sine values) are appropriate.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the reversed inequality direction.

Here `z.re : ℝ` is the real part of `z`, then coerced to `ℂ` via `(z.re : Complex)`, and `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus. `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the mathematical statement: For all `z ∈ ℂ`, |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|. The use of `Complex.sin (z.re : Complex)` and `Complex.abs` is a standard formalization: applying the complex sine to a real-embedded argument and taking the complex modulus, which coincides with the real absolute value of `sin(Re z)`.
- There are no auxiliary definitions, no placeholders redefining concepts; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof. This aligns with the instruction that the file provides only the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- Potential technical nuance: natural language uses real absolute value of the real number `sin(Re z)`, while the code uses complex absolute value of `Complex.sin` applied to the real-embedded `Re z`. These are equivalent in Mathlib (complex modulus on real numbers equals real absolute value, and complex sine restricted to reals agrees with real sine). Thus, no substantive difference.
- Namespace `complex` (lowercase) vs `Complex` (uppercase) is irrelevant to content; it just names the theorem.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

  - This declares a theorem named `log_one_sub_bound`.
  - It quantifies over a complex number `z : Complex`.
  - It assumes `hz : Complex.abs z < 1`, i.e., |z| < 1.
  - It concludes: `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`, i.e., |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z| / (1 − |z|).
  - The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but for auditing we only care about the statement.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove |log(1 − z)| ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- Lean statement: Exactly the same, using Mathlib’s `Complex` type, modulus `Complex.abs`, and principal complex logarithm `Complex.log`. The inequality is written identically.

Checks and potential subtleties:
- The branch of the complex logarithm in Mathlib is the principal branch. For |z| < 1, 1 − z lies in the right half-plane (Re(1 − z) > 0), so the principal log behaves as expected; moreover Mathlib’s `Complex.log` is total anyway. This does not change the meaning of the statement.
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced; there are no vacuous placeholders.

Final check: The formal statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement with no changes in assumptions or conclusions.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- def rho (θ : Real) (p : Real × Real) : Real × Real := (p.1 * Real.cos θ - p.2 * Real.sin θ, p.1 * Real.sin θ + p.2 * Real.cos θ)
  This defines the rotation of the plane R^2 by angle θ, acting on a point p = (x,y), using the standard rotation matrix: (x cos θ − y sin θ, x sin θ + y cos θ).

- theorem rho_comp (θ1 θ2 : Real) : ∀ p : Real × Real, rho θ1 (rho θ2 p) = rho (θ1 + θ2) p
  For all θ1, θ2, and all points p, composition of rotations equals rotation by the sum of angles, pointwise. This is equivalent to ρ_{θ1} ∘ ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2} as functions.

- theorem rho_inverse (θ : Real) : ∀ p : Real × Real, rho θ (rho (-θ) p) = p
  For all θ and all p, ρ_θ ∘ ρ_{−θ} = id pointwise. This states that ρ_{−θ} is a right-inverse of ρ_θ.

- theorem rotations_commute (θ1 θ2 : Real) : ∀ p : Real × Real, rho θ1 (rho θ2 p) = rho θ2 (rho θ1 p)
  For all θ1, θ2 and all p, rotations commute pointwise: ρ_{θ1} ∘ ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ2} ∘ ρ_{θ1}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The first claim “for all θ1, θ2, ρ_{θ1} ρ_{θ2} = ρ_{θ1+θ2}” is captured exactly by rho_comp.
- The second claim “(ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{−θ}” is expressed in Lean as rho_inverse, but only in one direction: it states ρ_θ ∘ ρ_{−θ} = id, not also ρ_{−θ} ∘ ρ_θ = id. However, combined with rotations_commute, one can deduce the other direction pointwise: ρ_{−θ} ∘ ρ_θ = ρ_θ ∘ ρ_{−θ} = id, so together they do express that ρ_{−θ} is the two-sided inverse of ρ_θ.
- The “In particular, rotations commute” part is stated directly as rotations_commute. In the natural language, commutativity follows from the composition rule and commutativity of addition; here it’s given as a separate theorem, which is fine.

3) Final comparison:
- The composition property matches exactly.
- The inverse property is stated only one-sided, but with the separately stated commutativity theorem the full inverse statement is implied. Thus, taken together, the code conveys the intended mathematical content. No vacuous placeholders are used; rho is the standard rotation on R^2.
- Minor deviation: rho_inverse alone is weaker than “(ρ_θ)^{-1} = ρ_{−θ}”, but the presence of rotations_commute compensates. Overall, the translation is essentially faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Uses mathlib.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_18142 (a b : Complex) : ... := by sorry` declares the theorem for complex numbers `a, b`.
- Statement: `Complex.normSq (a + b) = Complex.normSq a + Complex.normSq b + 2 * Complex.re (a * Complex.conj b)` says the squared norm of `a + b` equals the squared norm of `a` plus the squared norm of `b` plus two times the real part of `a * conj(b)`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- In mathlib, `Complex.normSq z` equals `|z|^2` (the square of the complex modulus). `Complex.re` is the real part, and `Complex.conj b` is the complex conjugate of `b`. Thus the Lean statement is exactly `|a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b)`.

3) Final check of differences:
- The only notational difference is using `Complex.normSq` instead of `|·|^2`, which is standard and equivalent.

The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for a translation check.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The formal statement exactly matches the natural language statement: it asserts |sec z| ≥ |sec(Re z)|, with sec(z) defined as 1/cos(z). The use of `Complex.abs`, `Complex.cos`, and `(z.re : Complex)` correctly reflects the absolute value in C, cosine on C, and viewing the real part as a complex number.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; there is just a single theorem statement with an omitted proof. This is fine for translation.

3) Comparison and potential subtleties:
- The natural language includes the definition sec z = 1/cos z, which the code follows. In Lean, division by zero is defined (1/0 = 0 via inv 0 = 0), making sec a total function. In usual mathematical practice, sec is not defined at zeros of cos, but the problem statement does not restrict z and explicitly defines sec as 1/cos. This slight formalization detail does not change the intended inequality statement and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- Direction and objects match exactly; there is no generalization or restriction beyond the stated claim.

2) Faithfulness check:
The natural language statement first mentions the exponential as an example (e^{z+w} = e^z e^w and e^0 = 1 ≠ 0) to conclude e^z ≠ 0. It then generalizes: ""In other words, show that if a function f satisfies f(z+w)=f(z)f(w) and f(0)=1, then f(z) ≠ 0 for all z."" The Lean theorem encodes exactly this general statement for functions f: ℂ → ℂ with the two hypotheses and the nonvanishing conclusion. The use of Complex and the operations + and * correspond to ℂ addition and multiplication. There are no auxiliary or placeholder definitions; everything is standard Mathlib. The Lean statement does not need to explicitly state 1 ≠ 0, since from h0 it concludes nonvanishing; requiring f(0) = 1 is even stronger than merely f(0) ≠ 0 and matches the natural language.

Here `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus, `Complex.arctan` is the complex arctangent, and `Real.pi` is π.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks: Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |arctan z| ≤ (π/4) * (|z| / (1 − |z|)) whenever |z| < 1. The Lean statement matches exactly: domain is complex numbers, hypothesis is |z| < 1, conclusion is the same inequality with the same expression and constants. Use of `Complex.abs` and `Complex.arctan` is correct for complex numbers; `Real.pi` is the standard π. The inequality is formulated in ℝ, as intended.

  This declares a theorem: for a complex number z with |z| < 1, the sum over n ∈ ℕ of (|z|)^(n+1) equals |z|/(1 - |z|). The `tsum` over `n : ℕ` of `(|z|)^(n+1)` is the series starting at exponent 1, i.e., ∑_{k=1}^∞ |z|^k, since it reindexes the natural numbers starting at 0 by adding 1 to the exponent.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib.
- Comment block: States the intended inequalities |sin z| ≤ 1/2 * exp |z| and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 * exp |z| for complex z.
- `open Complex`: Opens the Complex namespace to refer to Complex.* symbols without qualification.
- `theorem abs_sin_le_half_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`:
  This declares the theorem: for any complex number z, the absolute value (modulus) of the complex sine of z is at most (1/2) times the real exponential of the modulus of z. Proof omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for this task since we're checking translation fidelity, not proof.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_half_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`:
  Similarly, for any complex z, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|), with proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement is: For z in C, prove that |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean theorems exactly assert these inequalities using Mathlib’s Complex.sin, Complex.cos, Complex.abs, and Real.exp. The numerical factor 1/2 is represented as a real number `(1 / 2 : ℝ)`, and `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` corresponds to e^{|z|}. No additional hypotheses are introduced. Thus the formal statements are faithful translations of the natural language claims.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorems directly encode the two inequalities as stated.
- The use of multiplication `(1 / 2) * exp(|z|)` matches the natural-language `1/2 e^{|z|}`.
- The commentary calling the inequalities “possibly incorrect” is just a comment and does not affect the formal statements.
Therefore, the math problems are the same; there are no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in the full Mathlib library, providing complex analysis, absolute value, exponential function, etc.
- Comment: States the goal—inequalities for complex sine and cosine, namely |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_sin_le_half_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of sin z is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). This matches |sin z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.
- `theorem abs_cos_le_half_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For every complex number z, the modulus of cos z is at most (1/2) times exp(|z|). This matches |cos z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The Lean statements quantify over all z : Complex, as required.
- They use Complex.abs for |·|, Complex.sin and Complex.cos, and Real.exp(Complex.abs z) for e^{|z|}. The factor (1/2 : ℝ) is the real 1/2. The inequality is between real numbers, consistent with the modulus.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. Proofs are omitted (`sorry`), which is acceptable for a translation audit per the instructions.

3) Final check:
- The Lean theorems exactly restate the natural language inequalities without extra assumptions or changes. No generalization/specialization discrepancies.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation of the given statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem complex_exp_series_tail_bound (z : Complex) (n : Nat) :` introduces a complex number z and a natural number n, and states a theorem.
- Left-hand side: `(∑ k in Finset.range (n+1), z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : Complex) - Complex.exp z).abs`
  This is the complex absolute value of the difference between the finite sum of the exponential series up to k = n, namely ∑_{k=0}^n z^k / k!, and the complex exponential e^z. The sum over `Finset.range (n+1)` corresponds to k = 0, 1, ..., n. `Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : Complex` is k! viewed in Complex. `Complex.exp z` is e^z. Taking `.abs` is the complex modulus.
- Right-hand side: `≤ (Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`
  This is |z|^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! (cast to ℝ), times e^{|z|}. `Complex.abs z` is |z|, `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` is e^{|z|}.
- Overall, the statement is: For all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The Lean statement matches exactly: same variables (z ∈ ℂ, n ∈ ℕ), same finite sum limits (0..n via `range (n+1)`), same complex exponential, same modulus, and the RHS bound is exactly (|z|^{n+1}/(n+1)!) e^{|z|}.
- Types are handled correctly (denominator as Complex in the sum, and as ℝ on the bound), which is consistent with the intended real inequality.

3) Final check of equivalence:
- No extra assumptions or weakening/strengthening are introduced.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are used.
- The two statements are the same mathematical claim.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Here `Complex.abs` denotes |·| on ℂ (a real number), `Complex.exp z` is e^z in ℂ, `z.re` is Re z, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential e^·.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original asks: For z ∈ ℂ, prove |sinh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|} and |cosh z| ≤ 1/2 e^{|z|}. The two Lean theorems state exactly these inequalities for all z : Complex, using the canonical modulus and exponential. The multiplication by (1/2) is expressed as a product with `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`, which is equivalent to 1/2·e^{|z|}. There are no extra hypotheses or restrictions.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorems quantify over all complex z and assert precisely the two inequalities stated.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in mathlib.
- The docstring states exactly the natural language goal: for z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1 − z)| ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The theorem `abs_log_one_sub_le {z : ℂ} (hz : Complex.abs z < 1)` assumes z is a complex number with |z| < 1.
- The conclusion is a conjunction of two inequalities:
  (i) `Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1)`
  (ii) `∑' n : ℕ, Complex.abs z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`
  Here `∑' n : ℕ, ...` is the infinite sum over n = 0,1,2,..., but the summand uses (n + 1), so this is exactly the same as ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n. The terms are real (since `Complex.abs z : ℝ`), so both inequalities are in ℝ. `Complex.log` denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm, which is the standard interpretation in this context, and for |z| < 1 we are in its domain of analyticity around 1.

2) Whole translation fidelity:
- The hypotheses (z ∈ ℂ, |z| < 1) match.
- The chain inequality is represented as a conjunction of the two inequalities, which is logically equivalent.
- The series index shift (n from 0 with (n+1) vs. n from 1) is a faithful reindexing.
- Both bounds match the natural statement exactly.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
- No extra assumptions or specializations are added.
- The only presentational difference is expressing the chain inequality as a conjunction and the index shift in the series, both standard and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` brings in mathlib.
- The theorem statement: For a set `U : Set ℂ` and a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, assume `hU : IsOpen U` (U is open), `hf : IsHolomorphicOn f U` (f is holomorphic on U), and `h_inj : InjOn f U` (f is injective on U). Then the conclusion is `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0`, i.e., for every z in U, the complex derivative of f at z is nonzero.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.”
- Lean formulation uses a common pattern: instead of defining `f : U → ℂ`, it takes `f : ℂ → ℂ` and restricts properties to U via `IsHolomorphicOn f U` and `InjOn f U`. The conclusion `∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0` matches “f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.” The assumption `IsOpen U` is explicitly included, matching the natural language.
- The use of `deriv f z` is the standard complex derivative in mathlib for functions `ℂ → ℂ`. With `IsHolomorphicOn f U` and `U` open, this ensures differentiability at each z ∈ U, so the expression is meaningful and faithful to f′(z).

3) Final check: same or different?
- Domain handling: The natural statement has f defined on U, while Lean defines f on all ℂ but only assumes holomorphicity and injectivity on U. This is a standard and faithful formalization, not a substantive change.
- All key hypotheses (U open, f holomorphic on U, f injective on U) and the conclusion (nonvanishing derivative on U) match exactly.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- Right-hand side second part: I * ((z + I * w) * conj (z + I * w) - (z - I * w) * conj (z - I * w)) translates to i (|z + i w|^2 - |z - i w|^2).

Overall comparison:

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `def M (ξ ζ : Complex) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ...` defines a 2×2 real matrix depending on complex numbers ξ and ζ. The entries are:
  - M₀₀ = ξ.re + ζ.re
  - M₀₁ = -ξ.im + ζ.im
  - M₁₀ = ξ.im + ζ.im
  - M₁₁ = ξ.re - ζ.re
  So the matrix is [[Re ξ + Re ζ, -Im ξ + Im ζ], [Im ξ + Im ζ, Re ξ - Re ζ]].
- The theorem `jirilebl_ca_ca_1146 (ξ ζ : Complex) : Matrix.det (M ξ ζ) = Complex.normSq ξ - Complex.normSq ζ` asserts that the determinant of this matrix equals |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2, where Complex.normSq w = (Re w)^2 + (Im w)^2.

Step 2: Check faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language says: If a 2×2 real matrix M represents the real-linear map z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z}, then det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2.
- Compute the real matrix of the map z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar{z} with respect to the standard basis of ℝ^2 ≅ ℂ. Write ξ = a + ib, ζ = c + id, and z = x + i y. Then
  ξ z = (a x − b y) + i(a y + b x),
  ζ \bar z = (c x + d y) + i(d x − c y),
  so the combined map sends (x, y) to
  ((a + c) x + (−b + d) y, (b + d) x + (a − c) y),
  whose matrix is exactly [[a + c, −b + d], [b + d, a − c]]. This matches the Lean definition of M.
- Therefore the Lean M exactly encodes the matrix “represented by z ↦ ξ z + ζ \bar z.” The theorem’s equality det M = |ξ|^2 − |ζ|^2 matches the target claim.

Step 3: Final check.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; M is concrete.
- The theorem statement precisely matches the natural language result.
- No scope mismatch or extra/unmet conditions.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully translates the statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Set; open Metric: set up Mathlib and opens for sets and metric notions (balls) in ℂ.
- The theorem statement:
  - Parameters: {U : Set ℂ} with hU : IsOpen U, and {f : ℂ → ℂ}.
  - hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U: f is complex-differentiable (holomorphic) on U.
  - hder : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0: the complex derivative of f at each z in U is nonzero.
  - Conclusion: ∀ z ∈ U, ∃ r > 0, Set.InjOn f (U ∩ ball z r): for every z ∈ U, there exists a radius r > 0 such that f is injective on the set U ∩ ball z r.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- ""U ⊂ ℂ is open"" matches hU : IsOpen U.
- ""f : U → ℂ is holomorphic"" is represented in Lean by taking f : ℂ → ℂ and asserting DifferentiableOn ℂ f U; this is the standard Mathlib way to express holomorphicity on an open set when using an ambient domain.
- ""f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U"" is captured by hder : ∀ z ∈ U, deriv f z ≠ 0.
- ""Then f is locally injective on U"" is formalized as ∀ z ∈ U, ∃ r > 0, Set.InjOn f (U ∩ ball z r), i.e., there is a neighborhood of z in the subspace topology of U (namely U ∩ ball z r) on which f is injective.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain treatment: The natural language has f : U → ℂ; the Lean code uses f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U. This is a harmless and standard formalization; it does not change the meaning, since all properties are restricted to U and U is open.
- Local neighborhood: Using U ∩ ball z r matches the notion of a neighborhood in the subspace topology. Requiring r > 0 is appropriate. No extra or missing assumptions.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly matches the intended claim.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code to natural language.
- `theorem complex_exp_taylor_remainder (z : ℂ) (n : ℕ) :` declares a theorem for any complex number z and natural number n.
- `Complex.abs ((∑ k in Finset.range (n+1), z ^ k / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial k) : ℂ)) - Complex.exp z)` is the absolute value (modulus) of the difference between the finite sum ∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! and the complex exponential e^z. The sum uses `Finset.range (n+1)` which indexes k = 0, ..., n. The factorial k! is cast into ℂ so the division makes sense in ℂ.
- `≤ (Complex.abs z) ^ (n+1) / (Nat.cast (Nat.factorial (n+1)) : ℝ) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z)` states the upper bound: (|z|)^(n+1) divided by (n+1)! (cast to ℝ), multiplied by exp(|z|), i.e., e^{|z|}. Note that Complex.abs returns an ℝ, so the right-hand side is in ℝ, matching the left side.
- The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; for our purposes we only assess statement faithfulness.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The original statement: For z ∈ ℂ and all n ∈ ℕ, |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| ≤ |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}.
The Lean theorem exactly formalizes this:
- z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ: matches.
- Left-hand side: absolute value of partial sum minus complex exponential: matches.
- Right-hand side: (|z|)^{n+1} divided by (n+1)! times e^{|z|}: matches, with appropriate type casts to ℝ.
The order inside the absolute value (sum − exp z vs exp z − sum) is immaterial under absolute value, and here it matches the natural statement anyway.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions (Complex.abs, Complex.exp, Finset.range, factorial, Real.exp). The only difference is purely formal (type casts), which is necessary in Lean and does not alter meaning.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem schwarz_lemma (f : Complex → Complex) ...` declares a function f from C to C (entire domain), not explicitly restricted to the unit disk.
- `(hf_map : ∀ z, Complex.abs z < 1 → Complex.abs (f z) < 1)` assumes that for every z with |z| < 1, we have |f z| < 1; i.e., f maps the open unit disk into itself.
- `(h0 : f 0 = 0)` assumes f(0) = 0.
- Conclusion: `∀ z, Complex.abs z < 1 → Complex.abs (f z) ≤ Complex.abs z` states that for all z with |z| < 1, |f z| ≤ |z|.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Suppose f : D → D is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ D.”
- The code matches the mapping property (f maps the unit disk to itself) and the fixed point at 0, and the conclusion for all z in the unit disk.
- Critical discrepancy: the natural language requires f to be holomorphic on the unit disk; the Lean statement contains no holomorphic (analytic/differentiable) assumption (e.g., `HolomorphicOn`, `Complex.DifferentiableOn`, etc.). This is a major omission and significantly changes the meaning; without holomorphy the conclusion is generally false.
- Minor formalization difference: the function is defined on all of C in Lean but restricted by hypotheses to the unit disk; this is standard and acceptable.

Final check:
- The two statements are not the same: the Lean code omits the crucial hypothesis of holomorphicity. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

",0,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `injective_holomorphic_on_deriv_ne_zero` and takes:
  - `U : Set ℂ`, `f : ℂ → ℂ`;
  - `hU : IsOpen U` (U is open);
  - `hf : True` and `hinj : True` (placeholders claiming differentiability/holomorphicity and injectivity, but actually just True);
  - `z : ℂ` and `hz : z ∈ U`.
- The conclusion type is `True`, and the proof is `by trivial`.
- The docstring claims: If U ⊆ ℂ is open and f : ℂ → ℂ is differentiable on U and injective on U, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U. But the actual theorem statement does not assert anything about derivatives; it merely proves `True`.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: If U ⊆ ℂ is open and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Discrepancies:
  - Domain: the statement has f : U → ℂ; the code uses f : ℂ → ℂ without restricting to U.
  - Holomorphic/differentiable assumption is encoded as `hf : True`, i.e., vacuous; injectivity is `hinj : True`, also vacuous.
  - The conclusion is `True`, not `f' z ≠ 0` or any derivative condition. There is no derivative or holomorphic structure used at all.
  - No use of Mathlib's `HolomorphicOn`, `DifferentiableOn`, `AnalyticAt`, `Complex.deriv`, etc.
- Therefore the code does not formalize the intended theorem; it proves a tautology unrelated to the content.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- They are different. The Lean theorem is a trivial `True` statement with vacuous hypotheses, not the nonvanishing derivative result. Multiple mismatches: wrong function domain, vacuous assumptions, wrong conclusion type, and absence of derivative/holomorphic notions.

Given these issues, the translation is not faithful.

- `theorem abs_sin_complex_ge_abs_sin_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≥ |Real.sin z.re| := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number `z`. The statement is: the complex modulus (absolute value) of `Complex.sin z` is at least the real absolute value of `Real.sin z.re`, where `z.re` is the real part of `z`. No proof is provided (the `sorry` is a placeholder), which is acceptable for this auditing task since we only check the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Show that |sin z| ≥ |sin (Re z)|.”
- Lean: For all `z : Complex`, `Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≥ |Real.sin z.re|`.
- This is a direct formalization. The left-hand side uses the complex sine and complex modulus. The right-hand side uses the real sine applied to the real part and the real absolute value. This matches the intended meaning: |sin z| ≥ |sin(Re z)|.
- A potential subtlety is whether the right-hand side should be interpreted as complex sine of a real number embedded in ℂ or as the real sine. These coincide in magnitude: for real r, `Complex.sin r = Real.sin r` (as a real embedded in ℂ), and the complex modulus equals the real absolute value. Hence the formal statement using `Real.sin z.re` is equivalent to the usual interpretation.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The theorem statement exactly matches the mathematical claim, with standard Mathlib notions (`Complex.abs`, `Complex.sin`, `Real.sin`, `z.re`).
- No change in quantifiers or conditions; it is universally quantified over z in ℂ as desired.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- open Complex: Open the Complex namespace for shorter names.
- def sum_nat (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ℝ := 0: Define a dummy function sum_nat that, for any real-valued sequence indexed by ℕ, returns 0. This is explicitly a placeholder and does not represent the actual infinite sum.
- theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_19814 (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : Complex.abs (Complex.log (1 - z)) ≤ sum_nat (fun n => (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ)) := by sorry: For any complex z with |z| < 1, assert that |log(1 - z)| ≤ sum_nat of the sequence n ↦ |z|^(n+1)/(n+1). With the dummy definition, the right-hand side is 0, so the statement actually says |log(1 - z)| ≤ 0, which is false in general.
- theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_19814_sum_bound (z : Complex) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : sum_nat (fun n => (Complex.abs z) ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1 : ℝ)) ≤ Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z) := by sorry: For any complex z with |z| < 1, assert that sum_nat of the same sequence is ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|). Given sum_nat = 0, this says 0 ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|), which is true but not the intended claim about the actual infinite series.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, show |log(1 − z)| ≤ Σ_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|).
- The Lean code attempts to state two inequalities mirroring the two parts, using the sequence f(n) = |z|^(n+1)/(n+1), which corresponds to Σ_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n/n when summed over n ≥ 0. So the indexing matches conceptually.
- However, the code replaces the actual infinite sum with a dummy function sum_nat that always returns 0. This makes both theorem statements mathematically different from the intended ones. The first becomes |log(1 − z)| ≤ 0 (false in general), and the second becomes 0 ≤ |z|/(1 − |z|) (true but trivial and not the claimed bound about the series).
- Also, the use of Complex.log refers to the principal branch, which is a reasonable formalization choice for log(1 − z) under |z| < 1, so that part is acceptable.

Step 3: Final check — Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The core concept of the infinite series is replaced by a vacuous placeholder sum_nat := 0. This is a critical discrepancy. Even though the shape of the inequalities matches (indexing and functions), the replacement invalidates the meaning entirely. Thus, the translation is not faithful.
- If sum_nat were replaced by a legitimate infinite sum (e.g., Real.tsum over n ≥ 0 of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1)), the statements would indeed be faithful to the original. But as written, they are not.

Conclusion: The code uses a vacuous auxiliary definition that breaks the meaning of the theorems. If that were fixed, the final theorems would match the statement; as is, it fails the faithfulness criterion.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem geometric_series_abs {z : ℂ} (h : Complex.abs z < 1) :` declares a theorem for a complex number z with hypothesis |z| < 1.
- `(∑' n : ℕ, (Complex.abs z) ^ n) = Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)` states that the infinite sum over n : ℕ of (|z|)^n equals |z|/(1 - |z|). In Lean, `∑' n : ℕ, ...` is the tsum over all natural numbers n starting at 0.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- The natural language sum is from n = 1 to ∞: ∑_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n = |z|/(1 - |z|).
- The Lean code sums from n = 0 to ∞: ∑_{n=0}^∞ |z|^n but sets it equal to |z|/(1 - |z|). This is not the standard identity; the correct identity for the n=0 start is 1/(1 - |z|). To match the natural language statement, the Lean code should either sum `(Complex.abs z)^(n+1)` over n : ℕ, or restrict the sum to n ≥ 1.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The indexing differs: the Lean code sums from 0 while the natural language sums from 1. This causes a mismatch by a constant term 1. Everything else (the hypothesis |z| < 1, the use of Complex.abs, working in ℝ for the sum) is consistent. There are no vacuous definitions or placeholders; only the index shift is incorrect.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful due to the off-by-one error in the series index.

  Natural language: For any complex number z, the modulus of the complex cosine of z is greater than or equal to the modulus of the complex cosine of the real part of z. Here `z.re` is the real part of z (a real number), which is implicitly coerced to a complex number when fed to `Complex.cos`. The outer `Complex.abs` is the complex modulus; on a real input (embedded in ℂ), it coincides with the usual real absolute value.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: For z ∈ ℂ, |cos z| ≥ |cos(Re z)|.
- The Lean statement: For z : Complex, Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≥ Complex.abs (Complex.cos z.re).
- These match exactly, with the mild formalization detail that the right-hand cosine is the complex cosine applied to the real part (coerced into ℂ), whose modulus equals the real absolute value of cos(Re z). This aligns with the intended meaning.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions; no placeholders.
- No change in quantifiers or domains.
- Inequality direction and functions match.
- The only technicality is the coercion of `z.re : ℝ` to `ℂ`, but this preserves the meaning since |Complex.cos (z.re)| = |Real.cos (z.re)|.

- `import Mathlib` and `open Complex`: Brings in Mathlib and opens the Complex namespace; no mathematical content change.
- `theorem complex_abs_add_sq (a b : Complex) : (abs (a + b)) ^ 2 = (abs a) ^ 2 + (abs b) ^ 2 + 2 * re (a * conj b) := by sorry`
  This declares a theorem for arbitrary complex numbers `a` and `b`. It states that the square of the modulus of `a + b` equals the sum of the squares of the moduli of `a` and `b` plus twice the real part of `a * conj b`.
  Here `abs` is the complex modulus |·|, `re` is the real part Re(·), and `conj` is complex conjugation. The `^ 2` is squaring in the reals, and `2 * re(...)` corresponds to 2 Re(...).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The Lean statement is exactly the natural language identity: for all `a, b ∈ ℂ`, |a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a \bar b). The notations match: `abs` for |·|, `re (a * conj b)` for Re(a \bar b), and multiplication by 2 is explicit as `2 *`.

3) Final check:
The two statements are the same. There are no auxiliary definitions, no placeholders, and no change in generality or meaning. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable for this task since we are auditing the translation of the statement, not the proof.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library.
- `/-- For any complex number z, |sin z| ≤ 1/2 * e^{|z|}. -/` introduces the statement being formalized.
- `theorem complex_sin_abs_le_half_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sin z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` means: For any complex number z, the absolute value of the complex sine of z is less than or equal to (1/2) times the real exponential of the absolute value (modulus) of z. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is clear and precise.

- `theorem complex_cos_abs_le_half_exp (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.cos z) ≤ (1 / 2) * Real.exp (Complex.abs z) := by sorry` means: For any complex number z, |cos z| ≤ (1/2) * exp(|z|). Again, the proof is omitted.

Everything uses standard Mathlib constants and functions: `Complex.abs` is the modulus |z|, `Complex.sin`, `Complex.cos` are complex sine and cosine, and `Real.exp` is the real exponential function.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove for all z in C that |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}. The Lean statements are exactly these two inequalities, with correct coercions and interpretations of |z| as `Complex.abs z` and e^{|z|} as `Real.exp (Complex.abs z)`. The quantification over all z is represented by taking an arbitrary `(z : Complex)` in each theorem.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The statements directly match the original claims.
- The constants and functions are exactly those intended (no mismatched domains or norms).
- The presence of `sorry` only affects the proof, not the statement, and does not change the faithfulness of the translation.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- Comment: States the intended statements about cosine and sine at imaginary arguments, no proofs provided.
- `open Complex`: Opens the Complex namespace for constants like `I` and functions like `cos`, `sin`, `cosh`, `sinh` on `Complex`.
- `theorem cos_I_mul (z : Complex) : cos (I * z) = cosh z := by sorry`: For all complex `z`, `cos(I * z) = cosh z`. This is exactly the statement cos(iz) = cosh(z), with `I` denoting the imaginary unit and multiplication written explicitly.
- `theorem sin_I_mul (z : Complex) : sin (I * z) = I * sinh z := by sorry`: For all complex `z`, `sin(I * z) = I * sinh z`. This is exactly the statement sin(iz) = i sinh(z).

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
The natural language asks to show: for z in C, cos(iz) = cosh z and sin(iz) = i sinh z. The Lean statements exactly assert these two equalities for arbitrary `z : Complex`. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; only theorem statements without proofs, which is acceptable per the brief.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- Notational difference: `I * z` vs `iz` and `I * sinh z` vs `i sinh z` are identical in meaning.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: bring in Mathlib.
- The theorem states: For a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`, suppose (i) `HasDerivAt f f'0 0` (the complex derivative of `f` at 0 exists and equals `f'0`), (ii) `∀ z, |z| < 1 → |f z| ≤ 1` (on the open unit disk, the values of `f` are bounded in modulus by 1), and (iii) `f 0 = 0`. Then conclude `|f'0| ≤ 1`.
There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is omitted with `by sorry`, but our task is only to check the statement's faithfulness.

2) Compare with the natural language statement: ""Suppose f : 𝔻 → 𝔻 is holomorphic and f(0) = 0, then |f'(0)| ≤ 1.""
- Domain/codomain: The NL statement treats `f` as a holomorphic function on the unit disk `𝔻` with image in `𝔻` (typically the open unit disk). The Lean code treats `f : ℂ → ℂ` and imposes a bound `|f z| ≤ 1` for `|z| < 1`. This corresponds to mapping the open unit disk into the closed unit disk; this relaxation (≤ vs <, and allowing definition outside the disk) is usually acceptable as a slight generalization for the conclusion.
- Holomorphicity: The crucial difference is that the NL statement assumes `f` is holomorphic on the unit disk (complex differentiable on the entire disk), while the Lean code only assumes `HasDerivAt f f'0 0`, i.e., differentiability at a single point (0). This is a significant weakening of the hypothesis and is insufficient for Schwarz lemma; in fact, the Lean statement as written is false (one can construct a function that is only differentiable at 0, bounded by 1 on the disk with `f(0)=0`, but with arbitrarily large derivative at 0). Thus, the Lean theorem is not a faithful formalization.
- Bound strictness: The NL statement has `f : 𝔻 → 𝔻`, which typically means `|f(z)| < 1` when `|z| < 1`. The Lean version assumes `≤ 1`. This is a minor relaxation that still implies the same conclusion, so it's acceptable; the main issue remains the missing holomorphic-on-disk hypothesis.

3) Final check: Are they the same? No. The Lean code omits the essential hypothesis that `f` is holomorphic on the unit disk; it only assumes differentiability at 0, making the statement a much stronger (and incorrect) claim. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` brings in the Mathlib library, which includes complex analysis definitions like `Complex`, `exp`, `sinh`, and `cosh`.

- `theorem cosh_eq_exp_div2 (z : Complex) : cosh z = (exp z + exp (-z)) / 2 := by sorry`

- `theorem sinh_eq_exp_div2 (z : Complex) : sinh z = (exp z - exp (-z)) / 2 := by sorry`
  This states: For any complex number z, sinh z equals (exp z − exp(−z)) divided by 2. This matches the standard identity for complex hyperbolic sine.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement asks to prove, for z in C, the two identities: cosh z = (e^z + e^{-z})/2 and sinh z = (e^z − e^{-z})/2.
- The Lean statements precisely assert these two equalities for an arbitrary `z : Complex`, using `exp` for e^z and `/-/ 2` as division in the complex field. The minus sign in `exp (-z)` exactly denotes e^{−z}. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; these are direct theorem statements.
- Separating the two results into two theorems is perfectly faithful to the original statement containing two equalities.

Final check:
- The mathematical content is the same. No extra assumptions, no specialization/generalization beyond complex numbers. The translation is legitimate and faithful.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement: “Suppose f: C → C is holomorphic. Show that f is conformal at a point z0 iff f′(z0) ≠ 0.” The Lean statement assumes holomorphic at z0 (a strictly weaker, local hypothesis) and concludes the same iff condition about conformality at z0 and nonzero derivative. This is a standard and faithful formalization: ConformalAt is the Mathlib predicate for conformality at a point, and deriv is the complex derivative. No auxiliary or placeholder definitions are introduced.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Difference: The natural statement says “f is holomorphic” (often meaning globally or on an open set), whereas the Lean code assumes only “IsHolomorphicAt f z0.” This is a slight generalization/weakening of the hypothesis, which is acceptable and standard since the result is local.
- Otherwise, the conclusion matches exactly: conformality at z0 iff nonzero derivative at z0.

No red flags: It uses Mathlib predicates (IsHolomorphicAt, ConformalAt, deriv) with no vacuous definitions. The translation is legitimate and faithful up to a standard, harmless weakening of assumptions.

- The indexing of the series via `n+1` with n starting at 0 is a standard Lean/tsum convention and is mathematically identical to summing from 1 to ∞.
- All quantities are real-valued: Complex.abs returns ℝ, so the sums and bounds are in ℝ, as desired.

The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; this does not affect the statement's meaning.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Natural language: “Prove that if z ∈ ℂ, then |cos z| ≤ cosh(Im z).”
- `z : Complex` matches “z ∈ ℂ”.
- `Complex.abs (Complex.cos z)` matches “|cos z|” (modulus of complex cosine).

- The statement `Complex.log (1 - z) = -∑' n : ℕ, z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1)` asserts that the complex logarithm of (1 - z) equals the negative of the infinite sum over n ∈ ℕ (i.e., n = 0,1,2,...) of z^(n+1)/(n+1). Using the shift k = n+1, this is exactly −∑_{k=1}^∞ z^k/k.
- `:= by sorry` indicates no proof is provided, which is acceptable per the task since we only check faithful translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is: For z ∈ ℂ with |z| < 1, prove log(1 − z) = −∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n/n. The Lean statement requires the same hypothesis and concludes log(1 − z) equals the negative of the sum over n≥0 of z^(n+1)/(n+1), which is a standard reindexing of the sum from n=1 to ∞. Thus, the contents match exactly.

3) Final check:

The natural language statement is: Let z ∈ C. Show that |tanh z| ≤ tanh |Re z|. In Lean, `abs (tanh z)` denotes the complex modulus |tanh z|, `z.re` is Re z, `Real.abs z.re` is |Re z|, and `Real.tanh (Real.abs z.re)` is tanh |Re z| in the real sense. This matches exactly the given statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced.
- The only slight explicitness is specifying `Real.tanh` on the right, which is necessary in Lean and matches the intended meaning since the argument is real. The left uses complex `tanh` and complex absolute value, matching |tanh z|.
- No discrepancies in quantifiers or domains.
Therefore, the Lean statement faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- Docstring: States the intended proposition: For any complex z, |sinh z| ≤ cosh(Re z).
- `theorem abs_sinh_le_cosh_re (z : Complex) : Complex.abs (Complex.sinh z) ≤ Real.cosh z.re := by sorry`: This declares a theorem for an arbitrary complex number z. It asserts that the complex modulus of sinh z is less than or equal to the real hyperbolic cosine of the real part of z. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable per the task’s focus on translation, not proof.

2. Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The Lean statement exactly matches the English statement: domain is z ∈ ℂ; the inequality is |sinh z| ≤ cosh(Re z); functions and arguments are correctly applied (Complex.abs, Complex.sinh, Real.cosh, and z.re).
- No changes in quantification (universal quantifier over z is preserved), no extra hypotheses, and no weakening/strengthening.

3. Final check for discrepancies:
- There are no auxiliary definitions; no vacuous placeholders.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: bring in Mathlib.
- `theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_19538 (z : ℂ) (hz : Complex.abs z < 1) : ... := by sorry` states a theorem: for a complex number z with |z| < 1, the following inequality holds.
- The left-hand side `tsum (fun n : ℕ => (Complex.abs z)^(n+1) / (n+1))` is the infinite sum over n = 0,1,2,... of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1). This is exactly the series sum_{m=1}^∞ |z|^m / m via the index shift m = n+1.
- The right-hand side is `Complex.abs z / (1 - Complex.abs z)`, i.e., |z|/(1 - |z|).
There are no auxiliary definitions; the proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable as we're auditing the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original asks: For z in C with |z| < 1, prove sum_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|). The Lean statement uses a reindexed version of the same series (starting at n=0 with exponent and denominator n+1), which is mathematically identical. The condition |z| < 1 matches, and the inequality direction and expression on the right-hand side match exactly.

3) Final check:
- Domain: z : ℂ, assumption |z| < 1 — matches.
- Series: sum_{n=1}^∞ |z|^n / n vs. tsum over n≥0 of |z|^(n+1)/(n+1) — identical by reindexing.
- Conclusion: ≤ |z|/(1 - |z|) — matches.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; only a theorem statement with an omitted proof.
Thus the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- theorem cos_conj : cos (conj z) = conj (cos z): States conjugation commutes with complex cosine: cos(conj z) = conj(cos z).
Proofs are omitted using sorry, which is allowed for the purpose of checking translation.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The three Lean theorems directly correspond to the three equalities in the natural language statement, with z universally quantified (consistent with “Let z in C” and show these identities for that z). No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The functions and operations used are the standard Mathlib complex exponential, sine, cosine, and conjugation.

3) Final check:
- Natural language: e^{\overline z} = \overline{e^z}, sin(\overline z) = \overline{\sin z}, cos(\overline z) = \overline{\cos z}.
- Lean: exp (conj z) = conj (exp z), sin (conj z) = conj (sin z), cos (conj z) = conj (cos z).
They are the same statements. The Lean version is even in the standard universally quantified form, which is appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem csc_le_csc_re_extracted (z : ℂ) :` introduces an arbitrary complex number z and states a theorem about it.
- `Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin z) ≥ Complex.abs (1 / Complex.sin (z.re : ℂ))` states that the complex modulus of 1/sin z is greater than or equal to the modulus of 1/sin(Re z), where Re z is coerced from a real to a complex number. In standard notation, this is |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|, since csc = 1/sin. There are no auxiliary definitions; it is a direct statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language claim is: “Let z ∈ ℂ. Prove that |csc z| ≥ |csc(Re z)|.” The Lean theorem exactly asserts this inequality using Complex.abs and explicit 1/sin in place of csc. This is a faithful formalization of the stated inequality.

3) Final check and potential discrepancies:
- Domain/convention subtlety: In standard math, csc is undefined where sin = 0. The Lean statement uses total functions on ℂ, with 1/0 defined as 0 in the field structure, so the inequality is asserted for all z, including points where sin(Re z) = 0 or sin z = 0. This is a slight departure from the usual partial-function viewpoint but common in Lean/Mathlib. It amounts to a totalization rather than a change in the inequality on the domain where csc is classically defined. No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced.
- Notational difference (using 1/sin vs csc) is immaterial.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formal translation of the given natural language statement, up to the standard totalization convention for 1/sin at zeros. Hence it passes, with a minor caveat noted.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- `def HolomorphicOn (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate for “holomorphic on U,” but it is defined as `True`, i.e., vacuous. The comment explicitly says it is a placeholder, not the actual library predicate. This is a major red flag: it does not enforce holomorphicity.
- The theorem `identity_theorem_holomorphic` takes:
  - `U : Set ℂ` with `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `f g : ℂ → ℂ` with `hf : HolomorphicOn f U` and `hg : HolomorphicOn g U`: intended to mean f and g are holomorphic on U, but due to the placeholder, these hypotheses impose no constraint.
  - `S : Set ℂ` with `hS : S ⊆ U`: S is a subset of U.
  - `hacc : ∃ a, a ∈ U ∧ a ∈ closure (S \ {a})`: S has an accumulation point in U (this is a standard formalization: a ∈ closure of S without a).
  - `hfg : ∀ z ∈ S, f z = g z`: f and g agree on S.
  - Conclusion: `∀ z ∈ U, f z = g z`: f and g agree on all of U.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The structure of the theorem matches the natural language statement: U open, S ⊆ U with an accumulation point in U, f and g agree on S, conclude f ≡ g on U.
- The accumulation point condition `∃ a ∈ U, a ∈ closure (S \ {a})` accurately encodes “S has an accumulation point in U.”
- However, the key flaw is the placeholder `HolomorphicOn ... := True`. This makes the holomorphicity assumptions vacuous. The conclusion would then assert equality on U without the essential holomorphic hypothesis, which is not faithful to the identity theorem’s statement and would be false in general.
- There is no cheating elsewhere; the only auxiliary definition is the vacuous holomorphic predicate. The rest of the statement is a correct formalization.

Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The original requires f and g to be holomorphic on U. The Lean code’s `HolomorphicOn` is defined as `True`, so it does not enforce holomorphicity. This is a significant discrepancy that invalidates the translation.

Grade justification:
- Since the only substantive issue is the vacuous `HolomorphicOn`, but the rest of the formal statement mirrors the natural one well, this fits the rubric where vacuous auxiliary definitions make the translation fail, yet if fixed the theorem statement would be faithful. Thus a grade of 6 is appropriate.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- variable {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z0 : ℂ}: We fix an open set U in ℂ, a function f: ℂ → ℂ, and a point z0 ∈ ℂ.
- def MyIsHolomorphicOn (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop := True: Placeholder predicate: every function is declared holomorphic on any set U (vacuous/always true).
- def MyIsConstantOn (f : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop := False: Placeholder predicate: no function is ever constant on any set U (always false).
- def Myderiv (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z : ℂ) : ℂ := 0: Placeholder derivative: the derivative of any function at any point is 0 (identically zero function).
- Theorem derivative_has_finite_order_at_of_nonconstant ...: If U is open, f is “holomorphic” on U (under the placeholder), z0 ∈ U, f is not “constant” on U (¬ False, thus trivially true), and Myderiv f z0 = 0 (trivially true), then there exist m ∈ ℕ, m > 0, an open V with z0 ∈ V ⊆ U, and a function g holomorphic on V (under the placeholder) with g z0 ≠ 0, such that for all z ∈ V we have Myderiv f z = (z - z0)^m * g z. The proof is omitted (sorry), but our task is only to audit the statement.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
- Original statement: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open and f: U → ℂ holomorphic, nonconstant, with f'(z0) = 0. Show z0 is a zero of f' of some finite order.
- A faithful formalization would assert existence of m ≥ 1, an open neighborhood V ⊆ U of z0, and a holomorphic g on V with g(z0) ≠ 0, such that for all z ∈ V, (deriv f) z = (z - z0)^m g z. The theorem’s quantifiers and conclusion mirror this shape correctly.
- However, the code replaces key mathematical notions with vacuous placeholders:
  - MyIsHolomorphicOn is always true, so the holomorphy assumption is meaningless.
  - MyIsConstantOn is always false, so “nonconstant” holds trivially for all f.
  - Myderiv is identically zero, so the hypothesis f'(z0)=0 is automatically true and the conclusion equates 0 = (z - z0)^m g z for all z ∈ V, which is incompatible with g z0 ≠ 0 unless m > 0 and the equality is still nonsensical outside z0. In any case, it does not reflect the real derivative.
- Hence, the auxiliary definitions are vacuous and not faithful Mathlib definitions.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
- Ignoring the placeholders, the shape of the theorem statement matches the mathematical content of “z0 is a zero of f' of finite order.”
- But with the actual definitions used in the code (vacuous True/False and zero derivative), the hypotheses and conclusion do not faithfully reflect the natural language statement.
- Therefore, as a translation, it fails the faithfulness requirement due to vacuous auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If the placeholders were replaced by genuine Mathlib notions (HolomorphicOn/AnalyticOn, IsConstantOn, deriv), the statement would be a faithful formalization. As is, it fails.

- `theorem holomorphic_local_injective {IsHolomorphicOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop} {deriv : (ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → ℂ} {U : Set ℂ} {p : ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} ...` introduces arbitrary parameters:
  - `IsHolomorphicOn` is an arbitrary predicate on functions and sets, not tied to Mathlib's notion of holomorphy (e.g., `HolomorphicOn` or `DifferentiableOn ℂ`).
  - `deriv` is an arbitrary function from `(ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → ℂ`, not Mathlib's derivative.
  - `f` is a function `ℂ → ℂ` (globally defined), not a function with domain `U`.
- Hypotheses: `(hU : IsOpen U) (hp : p ∈ U) (hhol : IsHolomorphicOn f U) (hder : deriv f p ≠ 0)` say:
  - U is open; p ∈ U;
  - f satisfies the arbitrary predicate `IsHolomorphicOn` on U;
  - the arbitrary function `deriv` applied to f at p is nonzero.
- Conclusion: `∃ V : Set ℂ, IsOpen V ∧ p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U ∧ Function.Injective (fun z => f z)` states there exists an open V with p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f is globally injective on all of ℂ.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊂ ℂ open, p ∈ U, f : U → ℂ holomorphic, f'(p) ≠ 0. Then ∃ open neighborhood V of p (typically V ⊆ U) such that f restricted to V is injective.
- Discrepancies:
  1) The code uses arbitrary placeholders `IsHolomorphicOn` and `deriv`, not Mathlib's real notions (`HolomorphicOn`/`DifferentiableOn`/`deriv`). This breaks faithfulness: the meaning of “holomorphic” and “derivative” is not enforced.
  2) The conclusion requires `Function.Injective (fun z => f z)`, i.e., f is injective on all of ℂ, instead of injective on V. The faithful formalization should use `Set.InjOn f V` or `Function.Injective (fun z : V => f z)`. This is a major mismatch.
  3) Domain of f is ℂ rather than U. While having f globally defined is a benign strengthening if one also requires V ⊆ U (which they do), this alone would be acceptable. But combined with (2) it becomes seriously incorrect.
- Use of Mathlib terms: The code does not use the standard Mathlib definitions for holomorphic or derivative, which is a red flag per the guidelines.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced, but the arbitrary parameters essentially vacate the intended semantics.

Final check:
- The Lean statement is not the same as the natural language statement. It is both too weak (holomorphy/derivative are arbitrary predicates) and too strong in the conclusion (global injectivity, not local). Therefore, it is not a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable (holomorphic_on : Set Complex → (Complex → Complex) → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate `holomorphic_on` taking a subset of ℂ and a function ℂ → ℂ to a proposition. This is not Mathlib’s standard notion; it's just a parameter.
- The theorem `max_modulus_local_const` states: For an open set `U : Set Complex`, a function `f : Complex → Complex`, a hypothesis `hf : holomorphic_on U f`, a point `z0 ∈ U`, and an assumption `hmax : ∃ r > 0, ∀ z ∈ Metric.ball z0 r, ‖f z‖ ≤ ‖f z0‖`, then there exists `r > 0` such that for all `z ∈ Metric.ball z0 r`, `f z = f z0`.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: `U ⊂ ℂ` is open; `f : U → ℂ` is holomorphic; if `|f|` attains a local maximum at `z0 ∈ U`, then `f` is constant in a neighborhood of `z0` (within U).
- Lean code differences:
  - Domain of `f`: Code uses `f : ℂ → ℂ` instead of `f : U → ℂ`. This lets the statement talk about values of `f` outside `U`.
  - Local maximum condition: Code assumes existence of `r > 0` such that the inequality holds for all `z` in the full metric ball in ℂ; it does not require `Metric.ball z0 r ⊆ U`. The natural statement (since `f` is only defined on `U`) means a local maximum relative to `U` and would require a neighborhood contained in `U`.
  - Conclusion: Code concludes `f` is constant on some metric ball in ℂ around `z0` (again with no relation to `U`). The natural statement requires constancy in a neighborhood of `z0` within `U`. The code’s conclusion is strictly stronger and not justified by the hypotheses relative to `U`.
  - Holomorphicity: The code uses an arbitrary predicate `holomorphic_on` instead of Mathlib’s standard ones (e.g., `AnalyticOn ℂ f U`, `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`, or `HolomorphicOn` if available). Moreover, this predicate is not used anywhere to connect to the conclusion; it makes the statement parametrically depend on an arbitrary property, which is not faithful to “f is holomorphic”.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The code’s theorem imposes a global local-maximum condition on `|f|` over a ball in ℂ and concludes global constancy on that ball (no restriction to `U`), with `f` defined on all of ℂ. The original statement concerns a function defined only on `U`, a local maximum relative to `U`, and constancy on a neighborhood within `U`.
- Additionally, the use of an arbitrary placeholder predicate `holomorphic_on` instead of the standard holomorphic notion is a significant mismatch.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The definition `discrete_in (U S : Set ℂ) : Prop := ∀ x ∈ S, ∃ V, IsOpen V ∧ x ∈ V ∧ V ∩ S ⊆ ({x} : Set ℂ) ∧ V ⊆ U` says: A set S is discrete in U if for every x in S there exists an open (in ℂ) neighborhood V of x such that V is contained in U and V ∩ S ⊆ {x}. Since x ∈ S and x ∈ V, we also have x ∈ V ∩ S, so V ∩ S ⊆ {x} implies V ∩ S = {x}. Thus this matches the usual notion: each point of S is isolated in the subspace U by an ambient open set inside U.

- The theorem `zeros_of_deriv_discrete (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (hnc : ∃ z1 z2, z1 ∈ U ∧ z2 ∈ U ∧ f z1 ≠ f z2) : discrete_in U {z | z ∈ U ∧ deriv f z = 0}` states: If U is open, f is (complex) differentiable on U, and f is not constant on U (witnessed by two points z1, z2 in U with different values), then the set of points z in U where the complex derivative of f at z is zero is discrete in U (in the above sense).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: U ⊆ ℂ is open; f: U → ℂ is holomorphic; f is not constant; show { z ∈ U : f'(z)=0 } is discrete in U.
- Lean: U is open (hU). f is a function ℂ → ℂ but is assumed DifferentiableOn ℂ f U; on an open set, this corresponds to holomorphic. Non-constancy on U is encoded as ∃ z1,z2 ∈ U with f z1 ≠ f z2. The set considered is exactly { z | z ∈ U ∧ deriv f z = 0 }. The discreteness notion matches the standard one in the subspace U (they require V open in ℂ and contained in U, which is equivalent to being open in U since U is open). Using ⊆ {x} instead of equality is harmless because x ∈ V ∩ S ensures equality.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The only formalization difference is taking f : ℂ → ℂ with DifferentiableOn on U instead of f : U → ℂ holomorphic; this is a standard and faithful formalization. All assumptions match, and the conclusion matches precisely. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; the auxiliary definition `discrete_in` is legitimate and correctly models the intended concept.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

- `theorem injective_holomorphic_fderiv_ne_zero {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U) (hf_inj : InjOn f U) {z : ℂ} (hz : z ∈ U) : fderiv ℂ f z ≠ 0 := by sorry`
  - Let U be a subset of ℂ and f be a function from ℂ to ℂ. Assume U is open (`IsOpen U`). Assume f is complex-differentiable on U (`DifferentiableOn ℂ f U`), i.e., holomorphic on U. Assume f is injective on U (`InjOn f U`). For any z ∈ ℂ with z ∈ U, conclude that the Fréchet derivative of f at z over ℂ, `fderiv ℂ f z`, is not the zero continuous linear map.

Step 2: Assess whether this matches the original statement.
- Original: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and f: U → ℂ is holomorphic and injective, then f'(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ U.
- Lean reformulation: Uses f: ℂ → ℂ together with properties restricted to U via `DifferentiableOn` and `InjOn`. This is a standard and faithful way to encode a function defined on a subset. The openness hypothesis is included. Holomorphic is expressed as complex differentiable on U. The conclusion states `fderiv ℂ f z ≠ 0`. In the 1-dimensional complex setting, the Fréchet derivative at z is the ℂ-linear map w ↦ f'(z) • w, so `fderiv ≠ 0` is equivalent to `f'(z) ≠ 0`. The statement is universal in z by taking arbitrary z with `hz : z ∈ U`.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The only formal differences are:
  - Domain encoding: f: ℂ → ℂ with restrictions vs f: U → ℂ. This is a standard formalization and does not change meaning.
  - Using `fderiv` (a linear map) instead of the scalar derivative f'(z). In ℂ-dimension 1, these are equivalent for nonzeroness.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (`IsOpen`, `DifferentiableOn`, `InjOn`, `fderiv`).
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language
- Universe/context: We work in ℂ with sets and functions. U : Set ℂ, f : ℂ → ℂ, p : ℂ.
- hU : IsOpen U — U is open.
- hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f U — f is holomorphic on U.
- hp : p ∈ U — p is a point in U.
- h : deriv f p ≠ 0 — the complex derivative of f at p is nonzero (well-defined since hf and hp).
- Conclusion: There exist open sets V, W ⊆ ℂ, a function g : ℂ → ℂ, such that:
  - IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W — V and W are open.
  - V ⊆ U — V lies inside U.
  - p ∈ V and f p ∈ W — V is a neighborhood of p and W is a neighborhood of f(p).
  - (∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x) — g ∘ f = id on V (left inverse on V).
  - (∀ y ∈ W, f (g y) = y) — f ∘ g = id on W (right inverse on W).
  - DifferentiableOn ℂ g W — g is holomorphic on W.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
The natural language statement: There exist neighborhoods V of p and W of f(p) such that f : V → W is a bijection and f^{-1} is holomorphic.

The Lean statement captures:
- V, W are open neighborhoods (true).
- V ⊆ U so the restriction f|_V makes sense (good).
- There is a function g that is holomorphic on W and satisfies g ∘ f = id on V and f ∘ g = id on W (these are the usual inverse identities).

However, the code does not explicitly assert that f maps V into W or that g maps W into V. In Lean, g : ℂ → ℂ is a global function, and the equations
  - ∀ x ∈ V, g (f x) = x
  - ∀ y ∈ W, f (g y) = y
do not by themselves imply:
  - f x ∈ W for x ∈ V (MapsTo f V W), or
  - g y ∈ V for y ∈ W (MapsTo g W V).
Without these mapping conditions, one cannot conclude that f : V → W is a bijection, nor that g is the inverse function W → V, even though the compositional identities hold on those sets. In particular, surjectivity of f from V onto W would require that for every y ∈ W, there exists x ∈ V with f x = y; the equation y = f(g y) alone does not ensure g y ∈ V.

So the Lean statement is weaker than the natural language claim of a bijection f : V → W with inverse holomorphic: it lacks the explicit MapsTo/bijection conditions (e.g., f '' V = W and g '' W ⊆ V, or equivalent).

Step 3: Final comparison
- Same hypotheses: yes (U open, f holomorphic on U, p ∈ U, derivative nonzero at p).
- Intended conclusion: local biholomorphism around p, i.e., existence of V, W with f : V → W a bijection and inverse holomorphic.
- Lean conclusion: existence of V, W, g with two-sided inverse identities restricted to V and W, and g holomorphic on W, but no explicit statement that f maps V into W or that g maps W into V; hence bijection is not formally ensured.

Therefore, the code is close but not a fully faithful translation. It is missing the Mapsto/bijectivity conditions to make f : V → W a bijection and g the holomorphic inverse W → V.

  Natural language: For any open set U in ℂ, any function f : ℂ → ℂ, and any point p ∈ U, if we assume two arbitrary propositions hf and hder, then there exists an open V with p ∈ V, V ⊆ U, and f is injective on V. Again, hf and hder are arbitrary props; not actual conditions like holomorphicity or derivative nonzero.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement
Original: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open and connected, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f(U) is open (open mapping theorem), and at any p with f'(p) ≠ 0, f is locally injective near p.

Lean code issues:
- Holomorphicity is not expressed (should be HolomorphicOn f U for f : ℂ → ℂ). The code uses hf : Prop, a placeholder.
- Nonconstancy is not expressed (should be something like ¬IsConstOn connected components; in the connected case, NonconstantOn U). The code uses hfnc : Prop, a placeholder.
- Connectedness of U is not expressed (should be IsConnected U). The code uses hUconn : Prop, a placeholder.
- The derivative condition f'(p) ≠ 0 is not expressed. The code uses hder : Prop, a placeholder. In Mathlib, one would use deriv f p ≠ 0 (with appropriate differentiability/holomorphic hypotheses) or derivWithin f U p ≠ 0.
- Domain of f: The original has f : U → ℂ. Mathlib typically models this as f : ℂ → ℂ with HolomorphicOn f U. The code follows the total-function style but fails to assert HolomorphicOn.
- Conclusions: The first theorem’s conclusion IsOpen (f '' U) matches the desired openness of the image, provided the proper hypotheses. The second theorem’s conclusion (existence of an open V around p, contained in U, on which f is injective) matches local injectivity. However, without the real hypotheses, these are not faithful formalizations of the original statement.

Step 3: Final check — Are the math problems the same?
No. The code replaces all substantive hypotheses (open connected domain, holomorphic, nonconstant, nonzero derivative at p) by unspecified propositional placeholders. This is vacuous and does not faithfully translate the original theorems. While the conclusions are shaped correctly, the essential mathematical content is missing.

Additional notes:
- No auxiliary definitions were introduced, so no vacuous definitions per se; but the hypotheses themselves are vacuous (as raw Prop variables) rather than Mathlib concepts, which still violates the faithfulness requirement.
- A faithful translation would use: hU : IsOpen U, hUconn : IsConnected U, hf : HolomorphicOn f U, hfnc : ¬IsConstOn U f (or a suitable nonconstant-on-U predicate), and for the second theorem hder : deriv f p ≠ 0 (with p ∈ U and hf implying differentiability), or derivWithin f U p ≠ 0 as appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exp_series_tail_bound (z : Complex) (n : Nat) :` introduces a statement for an arbitrary complex number z and a natural number n.
- `abs (∑ k in Finset.range (n+1), z ^ k / (k! : Complex) - exp z) ≤ ...` says the absolute value (modulus) of the difference between the partial sum of the exponential series up to k = n and exp z is bounded by the right-hand side. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` corresponds to the set {0, 1, ..., n}, so the sum is ∑_{k=0}^n z^k / k!; `exp z` is the complex exponential e^z; `abs` is the complex modulus.
- `... ≤ abs z ^ (n+1) / ((n+1)! : Complex) * exp (abs z)` intends to state the bound |z|^{n+1} / (n+1)! * e^{|z|}. Here `abs z` is the real modulus |z|, and `exp (abs z)` intends the real exponential e^{|z|}. The factorial is cast to Complex in the code, but mathematically (and to match the inequality of real numbers) it should be a real factorial, i.e., `((n+1)! : ℝ)`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Mathematically, the Lean statement mirrors the original: for all z ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ, the truncation error |∑_{k=0}^n z^k/k! − e^z| is bounded by |z|^{n+1}/(n+1)! · e^{|z|}. The summation indices, the absolute value, the exponential, and the bound are all in agreement.

3) Final check and differences:
- The only discrepancy is a typing/casting detail: the code writes `((n+1)! : Complex)` on the right-hand side where the inequality is between real numbers (the left side is a real `abs`), so it should be `((n+1)! : ℝ)`. Also, `exp (abs z)` should be the real exponential; this will be inferred if the RHS is typed in ℝ. These are minor type-level issues; mathematically, the statement is the same as the natural language claim.

Conclusion: Aside from a small casting issue (Complex vs Real) on the RHS, the code is a faithful formalization of the given statement.

- `variable {U : Set Complex} {f : Complex → Complex} {p : Complex}`: We fix an open set U in ℂ, a complex function f: ℂ → ℂ (to be used only on U), and a point p ∈ ℂ.
- The theorem `holomorphic_local_inverse_of_nonzero_deriv` has hypotheses:
  - `hU : IsOpen U`: U is open.
  - `hf : IsHolomorphicOn f U`: f is holomorphic on U.
  - `hp : p ∈ U`: p is in U.
  - `hfp : deriv f p ≠ 0`: the (complex) derivative of f at p is nonzero.
- Conclusion: There exist open sets V, W ⊆ ℂ such that:
  - `IsOpen V ∧ IsOpen W`: both V and W are open.
  - `p ∈ V ∧ V ⊆ U`: p ∈ V and V ⊆ U.
  - `f '' V = W`: the image of V under f is exactly W.
  - `InjectiveOn f V`: the restriction of f to V is injective.
  - `∃ (g : Complex → Complex), IsHolomorphicOn g W ∧ (∀ x, x ∈ V → g (f x) = x) ∧ (∀ y, y ∈ W → f (g y) = y)`: there exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ that is holomorphic on W and serves as a two-sided inverse between V and W (g ∘ f = id on V and f ∘ g = id on W).

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open, f: U → ℂ is holomorphic, and f'(p) ≠ 0 for p ∈ U, then there exist open V, W ⊂ ℂ with p ∈ V ⊂ U, f(V) = W, and f|_V injective with holomorphic inverse.
- The code matches this precisely:
  - U open, f holomorphic on U, p ∈ U, f'(p) ≠ 0 are all present.
  - Existence of open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f '' V = W matches f(V) = W.
  - `InjectiveOn f V` matches “f|_V injective”.
  - Existence of g holomorphic on W with g ∘ f = id on V and f ∘ g = id on W expresses that g is the (holomorphic) inverse of f|_V from W to V.
- Minor formalization aspects:
  - f is a total function ℂ → ℂ rather than f: U → ℂ, but the property used is holomorphic on U and all conclusions are localized to V ⊆ U. This is a standard harmless formalization.
  - The code asserts two-sided inverse equalities on the appropriate domains, which is exactly the desired “with holomorphic inverse”.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all notions (IsHolomorphicOn, deriv, IsOpen, InjectiveOn, image) are standard in Mathlib.
- The statement is not a weaker/stronger misfit; it is essentially the standard local inverse (inverse function theorem for holomorphic maps) at a point with nonzero derivative.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: a, b : ℝ; γ : ℝ → ℂ; θ : ℝ → ℝ.
- hγc: γ is continuous on the closed interval Icc a b (i.e., [a,b]).
- hθc: θ is continuous on [a,b].
- heq: For all t ∈ [a,b], exp(i θ(t)) = γ(t) / |γ(t)| (formalized as Complex.exp (Complex.I * θ t) = γ t / Complex.ofReal (Complex.abs (γ t))). This matches e^{iθ(t)} = γ(t)/|γ(t)|.
- hclosed: γ a = γ b (the curve is closed).
- hsimple: γ is injective on the open interval (a,b), i.e., simple except possibly at endpoints. Together with hclosed this encodes a simple closed curve parameterization.
- hnonzero: For all t ∈ [a,b], γ t ≠ 0 (the curve avoids the origin).

Conclusion claimed:
- There exists θ' : ℝ → ℝ, continuous on [a,b], such that for all t ∈ [a,b], exp(i θ'(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)|, and θ'(a) = θ(a). This is the existence of a continuous lift of the argument that agrees at the start.
- Additionally, (θ'(b) = θ'(a) + 2π) ↔ 0 ∈ interior (range γ).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Existence and properties of θ': The Lean statement matches the requirement of a continuous lift θ~ with exp(i θ~(t)) = γ(t)/|γ(t)| and θ~(a) = θ(a). The code assumes continuity (instead of piecewise smoothness), which is a harmless generalization for the lifting part.
- Simple closed curve and avoiding the origin: The code enforces closedness (γ a = γ b) and simplicity on (a,b), and nonvanishing, which aligns with the intended context for discussing the bounded region.
- Critical discrepancy: The equivalence in the code is (θ'(b) = θ'(a) + 2π) ↔ 0 ∈ interior (range γ). This is not the same as “the origin is inside the region bounded by γ.” For a simple closed (Jordan) curve, the “region bounded by γ” refers to the bounded connected component of ℂ \ (γ '' [a,b]), not the topological interior of the image of the curve. The interior of the image (a 1-dimensional set) in ℝ² is empty, so interior (range γ) = ∅ in typical cases; thus the right-hand side is almost always false and does not capture “inside the region bounded by γ.”
- Further discrepancy: The code uses range γ (the image of γ over all ℝ) rather than γ '' (Icc a b), the image of the parameter interval. This can change the set under consideration and is not faithful to the statement about the specific closed curve on [a,b].
- Orientation/sign issue: The natural language states +2π, which implicitly assumes a positive (counterclockwise) orientation. The code also uses +2π. This is acceptable if orientation is intended, but it’s secondary compared to the incorrect use of interior(range γ).

Final check:
- The core lifting part is fine.
- The “iff” condition is not faithful: it uses 0 ∈ interior (range γ) instead of 0 lying in the bounded component of ℂ \ (γ '' [a,b]). Also, it uses the full range γ instead of the image over [a,b]. These are significant mismatches in meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

  Natural language: Let U be an open subset of ℂ, let f : ℂ → ℂ be a function that is holomorphic on U and not constant on U. Then f is an open map (as a function from ℂ to ℂ), i.e., for every open S ⊆ ℂ, the image f '' S is open in ℂ.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The original statement: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open and f : U → ℂ be holomorphic and nonconstant. Then f is an open mapping. In the usual mathematical sense, this means: as a map with domain U (with the subspace topology), f sends open subsets of U to open subsets of ℂ.
- The Lean code, however, states that f is an open map on all of ℂ: IsOpenMap f asserts that for every open S in ℂ (not necessarily contained in U), f '' S is open in ℂ. The hypotheses only say f is holomorphic and nonconstant on U, not on all of ℂ. This is strictly stronger than the intended statement and, in general, not justified by the given assumptions.
- A faithful formalization should restrict the domain to U, e.g., `IsOpenMap (fun z : U => f z)` or equivalently `∀ s, IsOpen s → s ⊆ U → IsOpen (f '' s)`. As written, the code does not capture the restriction of the domain to U.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant ⇒ f is open as a map on U.
- Lean: f : ℂ → ℂ, holomorphic and nonconstant on U ⇒ f is an open map on ℂ.
- Difference: The code asserts a global open mapping property on ℂ, not the relative property restricted to U. Hence the translation is not faithful.

  Natural language: For every open set U in ℂ containing L, there exists a real number R such that for all z with |z| > R, f(z) ∈ U. This is the topological (open-set) definition of lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L, interpreting “z → ∞” via neighborhoods of ∞ (i.e., complements of large disks), as in the Riemann sphere sense. Since L ∈ ℂ (finite), neighborhoods of L are the standard Euclidean ones.

  Natural language: For every ε > 0, there exists a real number R such that whenever |z| > R, we have |f(z) − L| < ε. This is the standard epsilon characterization of lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L.

  Natural language: The open-set (Riemann-sphere/domain-at-infinity) formulation is equivalent to the epsilon formulation.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement asks to show: lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere if and only if for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |f(z) − L| < ε whenever |z| > M. The Lean code defines precisely these two notions: an open-set formulation (using neighborhoods of L in ℂ and approaching ∞ in the domain via |z| > R) and the epsilon formulation, and states their equivalence. The mention “in the sense of the Riemann sphere” pertains to interpreting z → ∞ via neighborhoods outside large disks; this is captured in the definition by the condition |z| > R. Since L ∈ ℂ (finite), the codomain neighborhoods are standard Euclidean opens, agreeing with the Riemann sphere topology at finite points. Thus the code matches the statement exactly.

3) Final check and differences:
- Domain and codomain: f : ℂ → ℂ, L : ℂ, as in the statement. 
- No vacuous placeholders are used; both definitions are substantive. 
- The small naming difference M vs R is immaterial. Allowing R ∈ ℝ (not explicitly ≥ 0) is harmless since one can replace R by max(R, 0). 
- The phrase “in the sense of the Riemann sphere” is faithfully reflected by using |z| > R to encode neighborhoods of ∞ in the domain. 
There are no substantive differences.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem exists_delta_punctured_open (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) (connectedU : Prop) ...`: We fix an open set U in ℂ and an unused proposition `connectedU` intended to mean U is connected (but it's just an arbitrary Prop, not `IsConnected U`).
- `(f : ℂ → ℂ)`: f is a function on all of ℂ (not merely on U).
- `(HolomorphicOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop)` and `(NonconstantOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop)`: these are arbitrary predicate variables, not Mathlib's notions (and they shadow any real `HolomorphicOn` in Mathlib). 
- `(hf : HolomorphicOn f U) (hnon : NonconstantOn f U)`: assume f satisfies those arbitrary predicates on U.
- `(p : ℂ) (hp : p ∈ U)`: a point p in U.
- Conclusion: `∃ δ : ℝ, δ > 0 ∧ ∀ s : Set ℂ, s ⊆ ({ z | dist z p < δ } \ {p}) → IsOpen s → IsOpen (f '' s)`. There exists δ > 0 such that for every subset s of the punctured open ball around p of radius δ, if s is open in ℂ, then the image f '' s is open in ℂ.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: If U ⊂ ℂ is open and connected, f: U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant, and p ∈ U, then ∃ δ > 0 such that the restriction of f to Δ_δ(p) \ {p} is an open map. Interpreted formally: For every set T that is open in the subspace topology of Δ_δ(p) \ {p} (i.e., T = S ∩ (Δ_δ(p) \ {p}) for some S open in ℂ), the image f(T) is open in ℂ. Also, f is only defined on U, so we implicitly require Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U by choosing δ small enough.
- Discrepancies:
  - Domain: Lean code takes f : ℂ → ℂ, not f : U → ℂ. It never restricts to U nor requires Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U. It quantifies over s ⊆ punctured ball without requiring s ⊆ U. This changes the statement: it asserts an openness property for sets that may lie outside U, where f need not be holomorphic.
  - Holomorphic/nonconstant: The code uses arbitrary predicate variables `HolomorphicOn` and `NonconstantOn`, not Mathlib's actual holomorphic/nonconstant notions. This is a major red flag: the hypotheses are uninterpreted and could be anything.
  - Connectedness: The code carries an unused `connectedU : Prop` instead of `IsConnected U`. Even if fixed, it is not used in the conclusion; while connectedness might not be necessary for this local claim, the natural statement includes it explicitly. Carrying an unused arbitrary Prop does not faithfully reflect the mathematical content.
  - Open map on the subspace vs absolute open sets: The code only asserts that f maps sets s that are open in ℂ and contained in the punctured ball to open sets. Being an open map on Δ_δ(p) \ {p} requires mapping sets open in the subspace topology (i.e., intersections S ∩ (Δ_δ(p) \ {p}) with S open in ℂ), which need not be open in ℂ. The code's property is strictly different and in general weaker with respect to the intended open-map-on-subspace notion (and simultaneously stronger in an irrelevant direction since it speaks about sets not intersected with the punctured ball). It does not capture the subspace-open condition.

3) Final comparison:
- Multiple substantive mismatches: wrong domain for f, missing requirement Δ_δ(p) ⊆ U, misuse of subspace openness, and replacement of holomorphic/nonconstant by arbitrary predicates. Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Given these issues—including the use of arbitrary placeholders and a materially different conclusion—the translation is not faithful.

- No auxiliary fake definitions appear; it’s a single theorem with a proof placeholder (sorry).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: U is a domain (open and connected) and f : U → ℂ is holomorphic and nonconstant. If f(z0)=c and f′(z0)=0, then either f ≡ c or else z0 is a zero of f−c of order m and there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity).
- Comparison of hypotheses:
  • Code assumes U is open and z0 ∈ U, but does not assume connectedness; that’s a harmless generalization for this local result.
  • Code takes f : ℂ → ℂ holomorphic at z0, not f : U → ℂ holomorphic on U. This is a slight generalization (only local holomorphy at z0 is used), acceptable.
  • The natural statement assumes f is nonconstant, but also allows the dichotomy “either f ≡ c or …”. The code encodes the dichotomy directly, so dropping the explicit “nonconstant” hypothesis is fine.
- Comparison of conclusions:
  • The code’s second disjunct asserts a standard factorization f(z) − c = (z − z0)^m g(z) on some open V ⊆ U with g holomorphic and g(z0) ≠ 0, and 2 ≤ m. This exactly encodes that z0 is a zero of order m of f − c (and 2 ≤ m is consistent with f′(z0)=0).
  • However, the natural statement includes an additional conclusion: there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f^{-1}(c) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (with multiplicity). The Lean statement does not include this counting claim. While the counting result is a standard consequence of the factorization with g(z0) ≠ 0 (via Rouché/argument principle or the local mapping behavior), it is not stated in the theorem.

3) Final comparison:
- Similarities: both assert the dichotomy and, in the nontrivial case, that z0 is a zero of order m with a holomorphic nonvanishing factor. The Lean code is a standard formalization of “zero of order m” via factorization.
- Differences: the Lean code omits the specific conclusion about the number of preimages of c in a neighborhood (counted with multiplicity). Also, it uses f : ℂ → ℂ holomorphic at z0 rather than f : U → ℂ holomorphic on U, and does not assume connectedness of U; these are acceptable generalizations. The missing counting statement is a substantive part of the original claim and is not present in the code.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful because the point-counting-with-multiplicity conclusion is missing from the theorem statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `variable (holomorphic_on : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate named `holomorphic_on` on functions and sets. This is not Mathlib's notion; it's just a parameter.
- `variable (analytic_at : (ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate named `analytic_at` on functions and points. Again, not Mathlib’s real definition.
- Theorem statement:
  `theorem holomorphic_on_analytic {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (h : holomorphic_on f U) : ∀ z0 ∈ U, analytic_at f z0 := by sorry`
  Natural language: If U is open and f satisfies the predicate `holomorphic_on f U`, then for every `z0 ∈ U`, the predicate `analytic_at f z0` holds. This is a purely schematic implication between two arbitrary predicates, with no commitment to Mathlib’s actual notions of holomorphic or analytic. The proof is omitted (`sorry`).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The original statement: For a holomorphic function f on a domain U ⊂ ℂ, f is analytic at every point. Moreover, at each z0, f has a Taylor series that converges in the disk of radius R equal to the distance to the nearest singularity (possibly ∞), and the sum equals f on that disk.
- The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s standard definitions (e.g., `AnalyticAt ℂ f z0`, `HolomorphicOn`, `Complex.DifferentiableOn`). Instead, it quantifies over arbitrary predicates `holomorphic_on` and `analytic_at`, making the statement vacuous from a mathematical standpoint.
- Content-wise, even if we replaced the placeholders with the correct Mathlib notions, the theorem only states “holomorphic on an open set implies analytic at each point.” It does not mention the radius of convergence being the distance to the nearest singularity, nor the precise domain of convergence of the Taylor series, nor does it articulate the equality of the sum with f on the corresponding disk. Thus it captures only a small part of the original statement.
- Also, the original assumes U is a domain (open and connected). The Lean code assumes only `IsOpen U`. While connectedness is not necessary for the local analyticity implication, the original statement’s stronger radius claim refers to the nearest singularity (a global analytic continuation notion) which is completely absent from the code.

Step 3: Final check.
- The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It uses arbitrary placeholder predicates instead of Mathlib’s real definitions and omits the key assertions about the Taylor series’ radius (distance to nearest singularity) and the equality of the sum to f on that disk. Therefore the two statements are different in both meaning and precision.

Conclusion: Not faithful. The placeholders are vacuous, and even if replaced by standard definitions, the theorem would still be missing the crucial radius-of-convergence/nearest-singularity part.

  Notes: hf and h are just variables of type Prop and are not assumed true nor used. The function f is defined on all of ℂ (not just U).

2) Comparison to the original statement:

- Lean code omits the crucial hypotheses: there is no assumption that f is holomorphic on U nor that f'(p) ≠ 0. The placeholders `(hf : Prop)` and `(h : Prop)` do not encode these facts; they are not even assumed true and are unused in the conclusion.
- Domain mismatch: the code takes f : ℂ → ℂ rather than f : U → ℂ. This could be a benign generalization if the correct hypotheses were present and we restricted to Ball ⊆ U (which the code does), but the missing hypotheses are the main issue.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Different. The Lean theorem asserts: for any function f: ℂ → ℂ and any open U with p ∈ U, there exists a small ball around p on which f is injective. This is vastly stronger (and false in general) because it lacks the holomorphicity and non-vanishing derivative assumptions. The propositions hf and h are vacuous placeholders and do not constrain f. Therefore, the code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Additional notes:
- No auxiliary definitions are introduced, but the presence of vacuous, unused Prop parameters (hf, h) is a red flag per the guidelines.
- Even if those placeholders were intended to represent the correct analytic conditions, in the current code they are not assumed/provided as hypotheses, so the final statement still does not reflect the original theorem.

They are completely different. The Lean code does not attempt to formalize any part of the original statement. There are no auxiliary definitions either; the only theorem is vacuously `True` and not a placeholder for the intended claim.

Conclusion: Not faithful. Grade should reflect complete mismatch.

  Translation: For a subset S of a metric space X, S is closed if and only if for every sequence u: ℕ → X and every point a in X, if every term of u lies in S and u converges to a (i.e., Tendsto u atTop (𝓝 a)), then a ∈ S.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: In a metric space, S is closed iff every sequence in S that converges in X has its limit in S. The Lean statement asserts: IsClosed S is equivalent to the property that for all sequences u with all terms in S and for all a, if u converges to a in X, then a ∈ S. This matches the intended meaning. Expressing convergence via Tendsto u atTop (𝓝 a) is standard, and quantifying over a with an implication is equivalent to saying “whenever u converges in X, its limit is in S” in metric (Hausdorff) spaces, where limits are unique.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: metric space – matches.
- Sequences: functions ℕ → X with all terms in S – matches.
- Convergence: Tendsto to a in the ambient topology – matches “converges in X”.
- Conclusion: the limit belongs to S – matches.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem tendsto_complex_at_top_iff states an equivalence for a function f : ℂ → ℂ at a point z0 ∈ ℂ.
- Left side: Tendsto (fun z => Complex.abs (f z)) (nhdsWithin z0 {z | z ≠ z0}) atTop means that as z approaches z0 within the punctured neighborhood (excluding z0), the real quantity |f(z)| tends to +∞ (the filter atTop on ℝ).
- Right side: ∀ M > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z ∈ ℂ, if z ≠ z0 and |z - z0| < δ, then |f(z)| > M. This is the ε–δ style formulation for tending to infinity, with punctured neighborhood (z ≠ z0).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language asks to show that lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ “in the sense of the Riemann sphere” iff for every M > 0 there is δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z - z0| < δ.
- Interpreting “in the sense of the Riemann sphere” for complex limits, lim f(z) = ∞ is equivalent to |f(z)| → +∞. The Lean left-hand side captures exactly this by requiring |f(z)| → atTop along the punctured neighborhood of z0.
- The ε–δ part in Lean includes z ≠ z0 explicitly, which is the standard punctured condition (equivalent to 0 < |z - z0| < δ). The natural language version omitted “z ≠ z0,” but in rigorous statements about limits this is typically implied. The code’s formulation is the standard, precise version.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only apparent difference is the explicit exclusion z ≠ z0 in the Lean code versus the omission in the natural language statement. This is a harmless precision: limits are taken over punctured neighborhoods, and many texts implicitly assume z ≠ z0. 
- The use of |f(z)| → atTop precisely encodes “tends to ∞ on the Riemann sphere,” so the absence of an explicit Riemann sphere type in Lean does not change the meaning.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; the statement directly expresses the equivalence.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful, precise formalization of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open MeasureTheory Set ENNReal`: Brings in Mathlib and opens relevant namespaces (measure theory, sets, extended nonnegative reals) used for outer measures.
- `variable {α : Type _}`: We work over an arbitrary type α.
- `lemma outer_measure_union_of_null (μ : OuterMeasure α) (A B : Set α) (h : μ B = 0) : μ (A ∪ B) = μ A := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any outer measure μ on α and any sets A, B ⊆ α, if μ(B) = 0, then μ(A ∪ B) = μ(A). The proof is omitted (sorry), but we only audit the statement.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let m* be the (Lebesgue) outer measure on ℝ^n. If A, B ⊆ ℝ^n with m*(B) = 0, then m*(A ∪ B) = m*(A).

The Lean lemma states this for an arbitrary type α and an arbitrary outer measure μ. This is a standard generalization: the property holds for any outer measure, not just Lebesgue outer measure on ℝ^n. The hypotheses and conclusion match exactly in structure (outer measure of union with a null set equals the original set’s outer measure). No extra or missing assumptions.

Step 3: Final check: are the two math problems the same?
- Domain: Natural language specifies α = ℝ^n; Lean uses an arbitrary α. This is a benign generalization.
- Measure: Natural language uses the outer measure m* on ℝ^n; Lean allows any outer measure μ. Again, a benign and faithful generalization.
- Conclusion: Exactly the same equality μ(A ∪ B) = μ(A) under μ(B) = 0.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; `OuterMeasure` is from Mathlib.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} {p f' : ℂ}`: We work with an open set U in ℂ, a function f from ℂ to ℂ (globally defined), a point p ∈ ℂ, and a complex number f' representing the derivative value.
- `variable (IsHolomorphicOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop) (HasComplexDerivAt : (ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → ℂ → Prop)`: Introduces two arbitrary predicates named IsHolomorphicOn and HasComplexDerivAt, rather than using Mathlib’s actual notions (e.g., DifferentiableOn ℂ f U or HasComplexDerivAt f f' p from Mathlib). These are mere parameters with no link to Mathlib’s definitions.
- The theorem statement:
  - Hypotheses: U is open (`IsOpen U`), p ∈ U (`hp : p ∈ U`), f is holomorphic on U in the sense of the arbitrary predicate (`hf : IsHolomorphicOn f U`), f has complex derivative f' at p in the sense of the arbitrary predicate (`hder : HasComplexDerivAt f f' p`), and f' ≠ 0.
  - Conclusion: There exists a set V ⊆ ℂ such that V is open, p ∈ V, f '' V is open, and f is injective on V.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: U ⊆ ℂ is open; f : U → ℂ is holomorphic; f'(p) ≠ 0 for some p ∈ U. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of p (implicitly V ⊆ U, since f is only defined on U) such that f(V) is open and f|_V is injective.
- Discrepancy 1 (major): The code introduces arbitrary predicates `IsHolomorphicOn` and `HasComplexDerivAt` as variables, not Mathlib’s real definitions. This detaches the statement from the intended mathematical notions and makes it a schematic statement about unspecified predicates. Guideline 2 flags this as a red flag; it is not using the latest Mathlib terms.
- Discrepancy 2: In the natural statement, f is defined on U (f : U → ℂ). In the Lean code, f : ℂ → ℂ (globally defined), and V is not required to be contained in U. The conclusion should ensure V ⊆ U so that f|_V makes sense relative to the given domain; the code omits this. This is a mismatch. While one could choose V ⊆ U in the stronger domain setting, the theorem as stated does not enforce it, so it does not faithfully reflect the original context where f is only defined on U.
- Minor point: The code separately assumes `HasComplexDerivAt f f' p` and `f' ≠ 0`, which aligns with “f'(p) ≠ 0.” Assuming holomorphic on U plus open U would typically imply differentiability at p, but providing it explicitly is fine.
- The conclusion “IsOpen (f '' V)” and injectivity on V do match the intended result, except for the missing containment V ⊆ U.

Final comparison:
- Different notions of holomorphy/derivative (arbitrary predicates rather than Mathlib’s definitions): serious mismatch.
- Domain mismatch (f : ℂ → ℂ vs f : U → ℂ) and missing V ⊆ U: another mismatch.
- Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation
- `variable (IsHolomorphicOn : (ℂ → ℂ) → Set ℂ → Prop)`: Introduces an arbitrary predicate IsHolomorphicOn on functions and sets. It is intended to stand for ""f is holomorphic on U"" but is not defined or tied to Mathlib.

- `theorem holomorphic_zeros_are_isolated {U : Set ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hf : IsHolomorphicOn f U) (c : ℂ) : ∀ p ∈ U, f p = c → ∃ δ > 0, ∀ z, z ∈ U ∩ ball p δ → z = p ∨ f z ≠ c := by sorry`
  Natural language: If U is open, f is ""holomorphic on U"" (as per the predicate), and c ∈ ℂ, then for every p ∈ U with f(p) = c there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with z ∈ U ∩ ball(p, δ), either z = p or f(z) ≠ c. Equivalently, each solution p of f(z) = c in U is isolated, so the level set {z ∈ U | f(z) = c} is discrete in the subspace topology of U.

- `theorem holomorphic_local_factorization {U : Set ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hU : IsOpen U) (hf : IsHolomorphicOn f U) {p : ℂ} (hp : p ∈ U) {c : ℂ} (hfp : f p = c) : ∃ (k : ℕ) (δ : ℝ) (g : ℂ → ℂ), 0 < δ ∧ IsHolomorphicOn g (ball p δ) ∧ g p ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ z ∈ ball p δ, f z - c = (z - p) ^ k * g z := by sorry`
  Natural language: If U is open, f is ""holomorphic on U"", p ∈ U with f(p) = c, then there exist a natural number k, a radius δ > 0, and a function g that is ""holomorphic"" on the open ball ball(p, δ), such that g(p) ≠ 0, and for all z in ball(p, δ), f(z) − c = (z − p)^k * g(z). This captures the local factorization of f − c with multiplicity k and a nonvanishing holomorphic factor near p. Note: stating g(p) ≠ 0 implies g is not identically zero, covering that clause implicitly.

Step 2: Faithfulness to the original statement
- First part (discreteness of the zero/level set): The theorem `holomorphic_zeros_are_isolated` exactly formalizes that each root p of f(z)=c in U is isolated, which is the standard meaning of discreteness for {z ∈ U | f(z) = c}.
- Second part (local factorization): The theorem `holomorphic_local_factorization` states the existence of k ∈ ℕ, δ > 0, and a holomorphic g on the open disk around p with g(p) ≠ 0 and the factorization f(z) − c = (z − p)^k g(z) on that disk. This is precisely the standard Weierstrass factorization of a holomorphic function at a zero, and matches the natural language statement. The requirement ""g is not identically zero"" is stronger than needed given g(p) ≠ 0; the code asserts the stronger g(p) ≠ 0, which implies not identically zero.

Step 3: Differences and issues
- Major issue: The code does not use Mathlib's notion of holomorphic/analytic; instead it introduces an uninterpreted predicate IsHolomorphicOn as a variable. This is a placeholder rather than a faithful use or definition of holomorphic functions. While the theorems are stated in the correct shape, they are parameterized by an arbitrary predicate and hence are not concretely about holomorphic functions.
- Minor, acceptable technicalities: The domain of g is ℂ with holomorphic-on-ball predicate, instead of a function whose domain is exactly the disk, which is a standard way to formalize this. The use of ball p δ for Δ_δ(p) is correct. The discreteness is expressed via an equivalent isolation condition on each zero p.

Conclusion: The logical content of the theorems matches the natural language statement very closely, but the failure to tie IsHolomorphicOn to Mathlib's holomorphic notion (or to define it faithfully) is a significant red flag according to the guidelines. Therefore, it is not a fully faithful translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The code assumes U is open in ℂ, matching the hypothesis.
- It produces a sequence K n of compact sets with K n ⊆ interior K (n+1), matching the nested interior condition.
- It asserts U = ⋃ interior(K n), matching the exhaustion by interiors.
- It asserts for each n the existence of a finite collection of closed disks covering K n and lying inside interior(K (n+1)), exactly as required.
- The natural language says the K n are ""compact subsets of U"". While the code does not state K n ⊆ U explicitly, it follows from the given properties: since U = ⋃ interior(K m), each interior(K m) ⊆ U. Hence interior(K (n+1)) ⊆ U, and thus K n ⊆ interior(K (n+1)) ⊆ U. So the code implies K n ⊆ U.
- Representing the finite collection of closed disks as a finite union of Metric.closedBall c (r c) is standard and faithful in ℂ.
- Indexing from n = 0 instead of n = 1 is an immaterial shift.

3) Final check for differences:
- Possible ambiguity about whether ""⊂"" means strict subset; the code uses non-strict ⊆. This is a standard harmless relaxation and does not affect the essence of the statement.
- Radii are arbitrary real numbers; in Mathlib, negative radii yield empty balls, which does not harm the statement. No requirement of positivity is stipulated in the original statement.
Overall, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- f : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ) is a function ℝ^n → ℝ^n. hf : DifferentiableOn ℝ f U says f is (Fréchet) differentiable on U (this is weaker than “continuously differentiable” in the usual C^1 sense).
- p : Fin n → ℝ with hp : p ∈ U encodes the chosen point p ∈ U.
- h_deriv_invertible : Prop is an abstract, completely unspecified proposition intended (as the comment says) to represent the hypothesis that Df|_p is invertible; however, it is not tied to f, p, or any derivative in the statement. It is unused in the conclusion and carries no formal content.
- Conclusion: ∃ open V, W ⊂ ℝ^n with p ∈ V ⊆ U and f '' V = W (so f(V) = W). f is injective on V. There exists a function g : ℝ^n → ℝ^n such that:
  - For y ∈ W, g y ∈ V (so g maps W into V),
  - For y ∈ W, f (g y) = y (right inverse on W),
  - For x ∈ V, g (f x) = x (left inverse on V),
  - g is DifferentiableOn ℝ W (i.e., differentiable on W).
No statement is made about derivatives of g or equality Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1}.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Domain/codomain and openness: Correctly encoded as ℝ^n via (Fin n → ℝ), U open, p ∈ U.
- Regularity of f: The natural statement requires “continuously differentiable.” The Lean code only assumes DifferentiableOn (mere differentiability), not continuity of the derivative (ContDiff 1 / C^1). This weakens the hypothesis, so it does not faithfully capture “continuously differentiable.”
- Invertibility at p: The natural statement requires Df|_p invertible (det ≠ 0). The Lean code uses an arbitrary Prop h_deriv_invertible with a comment about intent, but it is not actually a statement about the derivative, not connected to f or p, and it is not used anywhere. This is a vacuous placeholder for a crucial hypothesis.
- Existence of local inverse and injectivity: The code does assert open V, W with p ∈ V ⊆ U, f(V) = W, injectivity of f on V, and the existence of a two-sided inverse g between W and V. This part matches the existence/uniqueness content of the theorem up to the representation of g as a total function restricted to W, which is standard and fine.
- Regularity of g: The statement requires g to be continuously differentiable; the code only assumes DifferentiableOn (again, weaker than continuously differentiable). So this part is also not faithful.
- Derivative formula: The natural statement includes Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1} for y = f(x); the code omits this entirely. This is a substantial omission.

Final check:
- The core hypothesis (invertible derivative at p) is not formalized and is replaced by an arbitrary, unused Prop. This fails the guideline against vacuous placeholders for essential hypotheses.
- The smoothness assumptions and conclusions about continuous differentiability are weakened (DifferentiableOn instead of continuously differentiable).
- The crucial derivative relation between g and f is missing.
Therefore, the Lean statement is not a faithful translation of the given theorem.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.

- theorem jirilebl_ca_ca_6177 (U : Set ℂ) (hU : IsOpen U) (f f' : ℂ → ℂ) {a b : ℝ} (α α' : ℝ → ℂ) (hα_smooth : True) (hα_nondeg : ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc a b, True) : ...
  Interpreted: Let U be an open subset of ℂ; let f and f' be arbitrary functions ℂ → ℂ; let a, b be real numbers; let α and α' be functions ℝ → ℂ; assume two hypotheses: hα_smooth is True (i.e., no real content) and hα_nondeg is also vacuous (∀ t ∈ [a,b], True).
- Conclusion: StrictMonoOn (fun t => arg (f (α t))) (Set.Icc a b) ↔ (∃ c : ℝ, ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc a b, arg (f' (α t) * α' t) = c).
  Interpreted: The function t ↦ arg(f(α(t))) is strictly monotone on [a,b] if and only if there exists a real constant c such that for all t in [a,b], arg(f'(α(t)) * α'(t)) = c.

Step 2: Assess whether it matches the natural language statement.
- The natural statement assumes: U ⊆ ℂ open, f : U → ℂ holomorphic and nonconstant; α : [a,b] → U is smooth with α'(t) ≠ 0 for all t. Conclusion: f ∘ α changes argument strictly monotonically on [a,b] iff arg(f'(α(t)) α'(t)) is constant.
- Discrepancies:
  - Domain/codomain: The code takes f : ℂ → ℂ (not restricted to U) and α : ℝ → ℂ; it does not assume α maps [a,b] into U.
  - Regularity assumptions: The code does not encode “f is holomorphic and nonconstant,” nor that f' is the derivative of f. f' is an arbitrary function. Likewise α' is arbitrary; hα_smooth and hα_nondeg are vacuous True statements, so the smoothness and nondegeneracy conditions are not represented.
  - Argument function: The code uses Complex.arg as a total function (arg 0 is defined by convention), whereas the natural statement implicitly requires the argument of f ∘ α to be meaningful (typically avoiding zeros) and to behave continuously along the path. None of these nonvanishing/continuity conditions are imposed.
  - The open set U and its openness hU are unused and do not constrain anything. The hypothesis α : [a,b] → U is not reflected.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- The core shapes “StrictMonoOn arg(f∘α) iff arg(f'(α) * α') is constant” are similar syntactically, but the Lean statement drops all substantive hypotheses linking f' to the derivative of f and α' to the derivative of α, as well as holomorphicity, nonconstancy, and the mapping into U. It also treats arg as a total function without ensuring nonvanishing. These omissions change the mathematical meaning drastically. The auxiliary hypotheses are vacuous placeholders. Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem lean_env_ok : True := by trivial`: States and proves the trivial theorem that `True` holds, with a trivial proof.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
The natural language statement concerns series: if ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then its Cauchy product with any convergent series converges absolutely. This involves notions of series, absolute convergence, Cauchy product, and convergence of series.
The provided Lean code does not reference series, absolute convergence, Cauchy products, sums, or any related structures. It only proves `True`.

3) Final check: Are the problems the same?
No. The Lean theorem is completely unrelated to the mathematical statement. There are no auxiliary definitions attempting to formalize the concepts, and the final theorem does not correspond in any way to the intended statement.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `def RiemannIntegrableOn {X : Type*} (S : Set X) (f : X → ℝ) : Prop := True`
  This defines a predicate “f is Riemann integrable on S” to be always true, regardless of S and f. This is a vacuous placeholder and not a faithful formalization of Riemann integrability.
- `theorem continuous_on_Icc_riemann_integrable {a b : ℝ} (h : a < b) {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hf : ContinuousOn f (Set.Icc a b)) : RiemannIntegrableOn (Set.Icc a b) f := by sorry`
  This states: if a < b and f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b], then f is RiemannIntegrableOn [a,b]. However, the predicate is the vacuous `True`, and the proof ends with `by sorry`. Even aside from the placeholder predicate, the theorem concerns functions on a real interval, not on a totally bounded subset of a metric space.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original: “Let (X,d) be a metric space, S ⊆ X totally bounded, and f: S → ℝ continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable.”
- The code does not mention metric spaces, total boundedness, or continuity on a totally bounded subset. It instead asserts a (placeholder) theorem about continuity on a real closed interval [a,b].
- The integrability predicate is defined as `True`, making any statement about Riemann integrability trivially true, which is illegitimate as a translation.
- The proof is `by sorry`, another red flag.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Different. The code addresses a different setting (ℝ with an interval) rather than an arbitrary metric space with a totally bounded subset. It also uses a vacuous predicate and a sorry proof. Even if the placeholder predicate were replaced with the correct one, the theorem remains about intervals, not about totally bounded subsets of a metric space. Thus it does not faithfully translate the original statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful. Vacuous auxiliary definition and mismatched theorem statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {f : ℂ → ℂ} {L : ℂ}` sets up a complex-valued function f on ℂ and a complex number L.
- The theorem statement:
  `Tendsto f (comap Complex.abs atTop) (𝓝 L)` means: as z tends to infinity in ℂ (expressed by the filter obtained by pulling back atTop on ℝ via the map z ↦ |z|), f(z) tends to L in the usual topology on ℂ.
  The right-hand side `(∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ z : ℂ, Complex.abs z > M → Complex.abs (f z - L) < ε)` is the ε–M formulation: for every ε > 0 there exists M such that |z| > M implies |f(z) − L| < ε.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The phrase “lim_{z→∞} f(z) = L in the sense of the Riemann sphere” refers to approaching the point at infinity on the Riemann sphere (one-point compactification) in the domain. In ℂ, this is equivalent to the filter of neighborhoods of infinity, which is also equivalent (in this proper metric space) to the filter `comap Complex.abs atTop` characterized by “|z| > M eventually.” Thus the left-hand side of the Lean statement correctly formalizes the limit at infinity in the Riemann sphere sense.
- The right-hand side is exactly the ε–M characterization stated in the problem.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain: ℂ → ℂ, L ∈ ℂ: matches.
- Sense of approaching infinity: comap abs atTop corresponds to the usual notion of z → ∞ (equivalent to the Riemann sphere topology at ∞ in ℂ).
- Codomain limit: neighborhoods of L in ℂ (𝓝 L) matches the intended meaning.
- Inequalities and quantifiers match exactly (|z| > M, |f(z) − L| < ε, ∀ ε > 0 ∃ M …).
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem statement is precisely the desired equivalence.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `theorem analytic_injective_is_conformal (f : Complex → Complex) (holomorphic : Prop) (hhol : holomorphic) (h_inj : Function.Injective f) : ...` 
  This states: For any function f: ℂ → ℂ, for any proposition `holomorphic` together with a proof `hhol` of it (not tied to f), and assuming f is injective, then the conclusion holds.
- Conclusion: `Function.Bijective f ∧ (∃ g : Complex → Complex, g ∘ f = id ∧ f ∘ g = id)` 
  This asserts that f is a bijection from ℂ to ℂ and there exists a global inverse function g: ℂ → ℂ satisfying both-sided inverse properties on all of ℂ.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumption is that f is analytic (holomorphic) and injective. The code does not encode “f is analytic/holomorphic”; it merely introduces an arbitrary proposition `holomorphic : Prop` with a proof `hhol` that is completely unrelated to f. Thus the holomorphic assumption is vacuous and not connected to the function.
- The natural language conclusion is that f is a conformal mapping onto its image: i.e., f is a holomorphic bijection between its domain ℂ and its image f(ℂ), and the inverse defined on the image is holomorphic. The code instead concludes that f is bijective as a function ℂ → ℂ (onto all of ℂ), and that there exists a global two-sided inverse g: ℂ → ℂ defined on all of ℂ. This is much stronger than “onto its image” and not what is asked.
- The code does not mention or require holomorphicity of f or of the inverse g anywhere in the conclusion. Hence it misses the conformality aspect entirely.

3) Final check: are the two problems the same?
- No. The code’s statement is not faithful:
  - It uses a vacuous assumption `holomorphic : Prop` unrelated to f.
  - It claims bijectivity onto ℂ rather than onto the image f(ℂ).
  - It requires a global inverse on ℂ rather than an inverse on the image.
  - It omits holomorphicity of both f and its inverse altogether.
Therefore the Lean statement is not an accurate translation of the natural language statement.

  - `Dense (⋂ n, U n)`: the countable intersection of the `U n` is dense.
- The `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided, which is acceptable for translation checking.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let (X,d) be a complete metric space. Let {U_n} be a sequence of open dense sets. Show that the intersection over all n of U_n is dense.
- Lean version: assumes a complete pseudometric space instead of a complete metric space; this is a slight generalization (pseudometric allows distinct points at zero distance). The conclusion and hypotheses match exactly: each U_n is open and dense, and the intersection over ℕ is dense.
- Indexing starts at 0 (ℕ) instead of 1, which is immaterial; one can shift indices. The notion of “sequence” as `ℕ → Set α` matches the countable family in the statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- The Lean theorem is a standard formulation of the Baire category theorem consequence for complete pseudometric spaces. The original asks for complete metric spaces; the Lean code slightly generalizes, which is acceptable per the guidelines. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used, and there are no auxiliary definitions. The semantics align with the original statement.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful translation (slightly more general) of the natural language statement.

The proof is omitted with sorry. Because all three predicates are defined as True, the statement is vacuous and does not capture the intended mathematical content.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
The natural language statement: ""Prove that every bounded convex set in ℝ^n is Jordan measurable."" The code aims to state this, using Fin n → ℝ for ℝ^n, which is acceptable. However, it replaces the crucial mathematical properties (bounded, convex, Jordan measurable) with vacuous placeholders equal to True. Therefore, the theorem as written does not express the intended mathematics; it is trivially true regardless of s.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are not. The Lean code uses fake/vacuous definitions for all relevant concepts, so the theorem statement is meaningless in mathematical terms. If the placeholders were replaced by faithful Mathlib predicates (e.g., Set.Bounded or Bornology.IsBounded on Fin n → ℝ, Convex ℝ s, and an actual IsJordanMeasurable notion if available), then the statement would align with the natural language claim. As written, it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Differences found:
- All key predicates (Jordan measurability, boundedness, convexity) are defined as True (vacuous).
- The result consequently does not encode the intended theorem.
- Using Fin n → ℝ to represent ℝ^n is fine and not a problem.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to vacuous placeholder definitions.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
Original statement: Let P be a permutation matrix. Prove that det(P) ∈ {−1, 1}. The code exactly defines what a permutation matrix is (via a permutation σ) and states that its determinant is 1 or −1. The code specializes coefficients to ℝ, which is a standard and acceptable specialization of the general statement. The proof method restriction (""without Laplace formula"") is about proof technique, not about the formal statement; the Lean code only states the theorem, which is fine per the auditing guidelines.

Step 3: Final comparison for differences.
- Coefficient field: The code uses ℝ, while the natural statement does not specify a field/ring. This is a slight specialization and acceptable under the guidelines.
- Representation: The code represents a permutation matrix as arising from an equivalence σ : n ≃ n, which is the standard formalization of a permutation matrix. Every permutation matrix corresponds to such a σ, so no loss.
- Logical form: The set-membership statement det(P) ∈ {−1,1} is expressed as a disjunction det = 1 ∨ det = −1; these are equivalent.
- No vacuous definitions: perm_matrix is a concrete definition, not a placeholder.

  - Conclusion: ∃ M, LipschitzOnWith M f s (f is Lipschitz on s with some constant M).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- Natural language: f : ℝ^n → ℝ, differentiable with ∇f continuous. Show that f is Lipschitz on compact subsets if ∇f is bounded on those subsets.
- The mathematical core is: If the derivative (gradient) is bounded on a subset, then f is Lipschitz on that subset. The mention of continuity of ∇f and compactness is a standard way to ensure boundedness on compact subsets, but the key implication is bounded derivative ⇒ Lipschitz on that subset.
- The Lean theorem generalizes this: it holds for any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E (so includes ℝ^n), any subset s (so includes compact subsets), assuming differentiability on s and boundedness of the (ambient) Fréchet derivative on s.

Step 3: Check for discrepancies
- Generalization of domain: E finite-dimensional vs ℝ^n. This is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- Subset condition: The Lean theorem applies to any subset s, not just compact subsets. This is a strengthening; it still implies the desired result for compact s. The natural language explicitly mentions compact subsets in order to apply continuity ⇒ boundedness, but the theorem focuses on the core boundedness ⇒ Lipschitz implication, which is faithful to the core claim.
- Assumptions on differentiability: Natural language assumes f is differentiable on all of ℝ^n with continuous gradient; the Lean theorem assumes DifferentiableOn ℝ f s (within differentiability) and does not use continuity. This is a weaker assumption and thus a generalization; it includes the original situation where f is C^1, so it is acceptable.
- Technical nuance: The Lean hypothesis uses fderiv (the at-derivative) rather than fderivWithin; with only DifferentiableOn, f may not be differentiable at x in the full sense. However, since the statement is only about the theorem’s conclusion and not its proof, and because the target natural language claim concerns globally differentiable f (hence fderiv coincides with the gradient), this mismatch does not make the translation unfaithful; it's a generalization aimed at the same core implication (bounded ambient derivative ⇒ LipschitzOn). Still, this is a slight technical misalignment in hypotheses compared to the intended setting.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: all terms are from Mathlib, no dummy definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and slightly more general formalization of the natural language claim: it asserts exactly that bounded derivative on a subset yields Lipschitz on that subset, in a setting that includes ℝ^n and compact subsets as special cases. The omission of compactness and continuity is acceptable because the result is stated under the boundedness hypothesis directly, which is the essential part of the original statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: standard imports and namespace opening.
- The theorem statement:
  `theorem geometric_series_uniform_on_Icc (c : ℝ) (hc1 : 0 ≤ c) (hc2 : c < 1) : TendstoUniformlyOn (fun n => fun x => (Finset.range (n+1)).sum fun k => x ^ k) (fun x => 1 / (1 - x)) atTop (Icc (-c) c) := by sorry`
  In words: For any real number c with 0 ≤ c < 1, the sequence of partial sums S_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k converges uniformly to the function x ↦ 1/(1−x) on the closed interval Icc (-c, c) = [−c, c]. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The original statement asks to show that the series ∑_{k=0}^{∞} x^k does not converge uniformly on the open interval (−1, 1).
- The Lean theorem asserts uniform convergence on every closed subinterval [−c, c] with c < 1.

Step 3: Are they the same?
- No. The Lean code proves (or states) a positive result: uniform convergence on compact subintervals [−c, c] with c < 1. The natural language statement is a negative result: non-uniform convergence on the whole open interval (−1, 1). While the Lean theorem is a standard and related fact often used in the analysis of geometric series (and is compatible with the known fact that uniform convergence holds on compact subsets strictly inside the radius of convergence), it does not state or imply non-uniform convergence on (−1, 1) by itself. There is no mention of (−1, 1) nor of failure of uniform convergence.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; the theorem is a genuine claim. However, it does not translate the requested statement.

Conclusion: The Lean code is related but does not faithfully translate the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem geometric_series_uniform_on_Icc (c : ℝ) (hc1 : 0 ≤ c) (hc2 : c < 1) :` introduces a real parameter c with assumptions 0 ≤ c and c < 1.
- `TendstoUniformlyOn (fun n => fun x => (Finset.range (n+1)).sum fun k => x ^ k) (fun x => 1 / (1 - x)) atTop (Icc (-c) c)` states that the sequence of functions s_n(x) = Σ_{k=0}^n x^k converges uniformly on the set Icc (-c) c = [-c, c] to the function x ↦ 1/(1 - x), as n → ∞ (with n indexed by atTop).
- There are no auxiliary definitions; the code relies on standard Mathlib constructs (Finset.range, sum, TendstoUniformlyOn). The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), but our task is to check the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks to show that the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^k converges uniformly on [-c, c] for 0 ≤ c < 1.
- The Lean statement asserts exactly the uniform convergence of the sequence of partial sums Σ_{k=0}^n x^k on [-c, c], and moreover identifies the limit as 1/(1 - x). This is a standard and more precise formulation of the same fact. Including the explicit limit does not change the essence of the uniform convergence claim; it strengthens it slightly in a fully consistent way.
- The domain matches: Icc (-c) c is [-c, c]. The parameter constraints 0 ≤ c < 1 match the hypothesis.

3) Final check: same or different problems?
- They are the same in mathematical meaning. The Lean version specifies the limit function 1/(1 - x), which is exactly the sum of the geometric series for |x| < 1, a condition satisfied on [-c, c] since c < 1. There are no extraneous or missing conditions. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {α : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup α]`: We work in a general normed additive commutative group α.
- The theorem `summable_grouping` takes a sequence `a : ℕ → α`, and a strictly increasing function `n : ℕ → ℕ` with `n 0 = 0`. It assumes absolute convergence: `habs : Summable (fun m => ‖a m‖)`.
- It defines grouped terms by finite sums over intervals `[n k, n (k+1))` via `Finset.Ico (n k) (n (k+1))` and the sum `Finset.sum ... (fun i => a i)`.
- The conclusion is twofold: (i) the series of grouped terms is summable, and (ii) its sum equals the sum of the original series: `tsum (grouped terms) = tsum a`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then any series obtained by grouping terms also converges and has the same sum.
- The Lean code formalizes “grouping terms” as partitioning ℕ into consecutive finite blocks determined by a strictly increasing sequence `n` with `n 0 = 0`, and summing each block. This is the standard precise formalization of grouping. Absolute convergence is expressed as `Summable (fun m => ‖a m‖)`. The conclusions match: the grouped series is summable and its sum equals the original sum.
- The setting is even slightly more general (any NormedAddCommGroup), which is acceptable and faithful to the spirit of the statement.

3) Final check for differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all notions are standard Mathlib ones. No auxiliary fake definitions. The code states exactly the intended claim: for any strictly increasing `n` with `n 0 = 0`, absolute convergence implies the grouped series is summable with the same sum. This matches the usual meaning of “grouping terms” (finite consecutive blocks covering all indices). The slight generality of α is appropriate and does not change the meaning.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Filter`: Bring in Mathlib and filter notation/tools.
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [CompactSpace X]`: We fix a type X with a metric space structure, and assume X is compact as a space (i.e., every open cover of X has a finite subcover). In Mathlib, `[CompactSpace X]` exactly means the whole space X is compact.
- The theorem `compact_metric_sequentially_compact (s : ℕ → X) : ∃ φ : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono φ ∧ ∃ x : X, Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 x)` states: For any sequence `s` in X, there exists a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` and a point `x : X` such that the composed sequence `s ∘ φ` converges to `x` (in the metric topology), expressed by `Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 x)`. This is precisely the notion of a convergent subsequence.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language assumption ""X is a metric space such that every open cover has a finite subcover"" is exactly captured by `[MetricSpace X] [CompactSpace X]`.
- The conclusion ""every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence"" is exactly the existence of a strictly monotone `φ` (a subsequence selector) and a limit point `x` with `Tendsto (s ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 x)`.

3) Final check:
- The math problems match exactly: compact metric space implies sequential compactness. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The statement is neither generalized nor specialized beyond the original; it is precisely the same.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is about a function f : ℂ → ℂ and a point z0 : ℂ.
- Left side: `Filter.Tendsto (fun z => (f z : WithTop Complex)) (Filter.nhds z0) (Filter.nhds (⊤ : WithTop Complex))` means: as z → z0 (along the usual neighborhood filter `nhds z0`, i.e., not punctured), the function z ↦ f(z) (embedded into `WithTop ℂ`) tends to the top element ⊤ (interpreted as ∞ in `WithTop ℂ`).
- Right side: `∀ M : ℝ, 0 < M → ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ ∀ z, Complex.abs (z - z0) < δ → Complex.abs (f z) > M` says: for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all z with |z - z0| < δ, we have |f(z)| > M.
- The theorem asserts these two are equivalent.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “lim_{z→z0} f(z) = ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere iff for every M > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f(z)| > M whenever |z − z0| < δ.”
- The RHS of the Lean theorem matches the exact quantifiers and inequalities in the natural language statement: it uses M > 0, exists δ > 0, and the condition |z − z0| < δ (note: it does not exclude z = z0, consistent with the wording given).
- The LHS intends to formalize “limit equals ∞ in the sense of the Riemann sphere,” but it uses `WithTop ℂ` rather than the one-point compactification of ℂ (the Riemann sphere), which in mathlib is modeled by `OnePoint ℂ` (and commonly available as `ℂ∞` / Riemann sphere). Thus, strictly speaking, it uses a different target space.
- Another subtlety: the code uses the neighborhood filter `nhds z0`, not the punctured neighborhood filter `nhdsWithin {z | z ≠ z0} z0`. This means the convergence is along all points sufficiently close to z0 including z0 itself. The natural language statement as written also uses “|z − z0| < δ” (without “0 <”), thereby also including z = z0; so this part is consistent with the given wording (even though the classical definition of limit at a point usually excludes the point itself).

3) Final check for faithfulness:
- Major difference: The statement explicitly says “in the sense of the Riemann sphere,” but the Lean code uses `WithTop ℂ` instead of the Riemann sphere type (`OnePoint ℂ` / `ℂ∞`) and its topology. This is not the same object in mathlib; the canonically correct formalization should use the one-point compactification for the Riemann sphere.
- Otherwise, the epsilon-delta side is faithful to the given wording (including z0), and the use of the unpunctured neighborhood filter matches that wording (though this is nonstandard mathematically).

Conclusion: The code is almost a faithful translation of the intended equivalence, but it uses `WithTop ℂ` instead of the Riemann sphere (`OnePoint ℂ`/`ℂ∞`). Because of this mismatch, it is not strictly faithful to “in the sense of the Riemann sphere,” though it captures the same intuitive property on the right-hand side. Therefore, it is “almost the same but not faithful.”

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem conditional_not_o_n_pow (a : ℕ → ℝ) (h_sum : Summable a) (h_not_abs : ¬ Summable fun n => |a n|) :` 
  This states: Let a be a real sequence indexed by natural numbers. Assume the series ∑ a_n converges (Summable a) but is not absolutely convergent (¬ Summable |a_n|), i.e., the series is conditionally convergent.
- `∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∀ C : ℝ, C > 0 → ∃ n : ℕ, |a n| > C / Real.rpow (n : ℝ) (1 + ε)`
  For every ε > 0 and every C > 0, there exists an n such that |a_n| > C / n^(1+ε) (where Real.rpow is the real power function). Equivalently, for every ε > 0, the sequence n^(1+ε) |a_n| is unbounded above.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language says: if ∑ a_n is conditionally convergent, then the terms a_n do not tend to zero “fast enough” to ensure absolute convergence. A precise and standard way to formalize “fast enough to ensure absolute convergence” is: being eventually dominated by 1/n^(1+ε) for some ε > 0 (since such a bound would imply absolute convergence by comparison with a p-series). The Lean theorem asserts that for every ε > 0 and every C > 0, there exists an n such that |a_n| exceeds C/n^(1+ε); equivalently, n^(1+ε)|a_n| is unbounded. This indeed implies that |a_n| is not O(1/n^(1+ε)) for any ε > 0, which captures the intended meaning: the terms do not decay at any rate that would guarantee absolute convergence.

3) Final check and minor discrepancies:
- Indexing: The natural language uses n from 1 to ∞; the Lean code uses n : ℕ (including 0). This is a harmless technicality since the conclusion is existential in n; one can always choose n ≥ 1.
- Use of Real.rpow at n = 0 would make the denominator 0, but the existential quantifier allows choosing n ≥ 1, so it does not affect the meaning.
- No vacuous definitions or placeholders are introduced; only a theorem statement with assumptions matching conditional convergence. The code uses standard Mathlib notions (Summable, absolute value), and the statement is a legitimate, strong formalization of the informal claim.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful and precise formalization (indeed a standard precise strengthening) of the natural language claim.

",7,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem `hasSum_f_nat_power_series` takes a real function `f : ℝ → ℝ` with the hypothesis `hf : f = fun x => 1 / (1 + x ^ 2)`, i.e., f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2).
- It asserts: For all real x with |x| < 1, the infinite series ∑_{n=0}^∞ [(-1)^n * x^(2n)] has sum f x. In other words, on the open interval defined by |x| < 1, the series ∑ (-1)^n x^{2n} converges to 1/(1 + x^2).

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
- The natural language asks to: (a) show that f is analytic, (b) find a power series for f at 0, and (c) determine its radius of convergence.
- The Lean statement provides: the explicit series expansion 1/(1 + x^2) = ∑ (-1)^n x^{2n} and specifies it holds for all |x| < 1. This effectively provides a power series centered at 0 and indicates the domain where it converges to f, consistent with radius 1.
- However, the Lean statement does not explicitly assert analyticity (e.g., `AnalyticAt ℝ f 0` or `HasFPowerSeriesAt`), nor does it explicitly state the radius of convergence is 1. It only gives a sufficient condition (|x| < 1) for the series to sum to f, without addressing behavior on |x| ≥ 1 or formally naming the radius.

Step 3: Final check of fidelity.
- The theorem captures the correct power series and the region where it equals f, which strongly suggests a radius of convergence 1. But it omits any explicit analyticity claim and does not formally assert the radius of convergence.
- Therefore, while it contains a substantial part of the intended content (the correct series and its region of validity), it is missing two explicit parts of the original request: a statement that f is analytic and an explicit statement of the radius of convergence.

Conclusion: Not fully faithful. No vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement is meaningful but incomplete relative to the original problem.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The context sets E as a finite-dimensional real normed vector space. U ⊆ E is assumed convex. f : E → ℝ is assumed ContDiffOn ℝ 2 on U (i.e., twice continuously differentiable on U). K ⊆ U is compact.
- The lemma states: For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and y ∈ U with ‖y - x‖ < δ, the Taylor remainder of order 2 at x, namely |f(y) - f(x) - fderiv ℝ f x (y - x) - (1/2) * (fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x) (y - x) (y - x)|, is bounded by ε * ‖y - x‖^2. Here:
  - fderiv ℝ f x is the (Fréchet) derivative at x, a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] ℝ.
  - fderiv ℝ (fun x => fderiv ℝ f x) x is the derivative of the derivative, i.e., the second derivative at x seen as a continuous linear map E →L[ℝ] (E →L[ℝ] ℝ); applying it to (y - x) and then again to (y - x) yields the quadratic form corresponding to the Hessian applied twice to (y - x).
- The quantification “∃ δ > 0, ∀ x ∈ K, ∀ y ∈ U, ‖y - x‖ < δ → … ≤ ε * ‖y - x‖^2” expresses uniformity in x over K (δ does not depend on x) and the standard quadratic error bound.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: Let f : ℝ^n → ℝ be C^2 with H_f continuous on a convex set U. Show the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean code sets a slightly more general context: E is any finite-dimensional real normed space (so includes ℝ^n), U is convex, f is C^2 on U (ContDiffOn ℝ 2), and then asserts the uniform second-order Taylor remainder estimate on each compact K ⊆ U. This matches the mathematical content: C^2 implies the second derivative (Hessian) is continuous, and the result is the uniform quadratic error bound on compact subsets. The explicit inequality is the standard formulation of uniform second-order Taylor expansion.

3) Comparison and any differences:
- Generalization: The Lean statement holds in any finite-dimensional real normed space E, not just ℝ^n. This is a harmless and standard generalization.
- Domain of y: The Lean version requires y ∈ U and near x ∈ K, not necessarily y ∈ K. This is common in such statements and matches the idea of working inside U; it is not a restriction compared to the usual formulation of uniformity on K.
- Regularity: The natural language says “C^2 with H_f continuous.” In standard usage, C^2 already includes continuity of the second derivative; the Lean assumption ContDiffOn ℝ 2 indeed provides continuity of the derivatives up to order 2, so this matches or slightly strengthens the intended assumption.
- All auxiliary constructs are standard Mathlib notions; there are no vacuous definitions. The presence of “sorry” indicates no proof is given, but the statement itself is precise and faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful (slightly more general) formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: load library and open the namespace for sets.
- The theorem `complex_local_diffeomorphism_of_nonzero_deriv (f : ℂ → ℂ) {z0 a : ℂ} (h : HasDerivAt f a z0) (ha : a ≠ 0) : ...` states: Let f: ℂ → ℂ, and suppose f has complex derivative a at z0 (i.e., HasDerivAt f a z0) and a ≠ 0. Then there exist open sets U, V in ℂ and a function g: ℂ → ℂ such that:
  - U and V are open,
  - z0 ∈ U,
  - f '' U = V (the image of U under f is exactly V),
  - g is a two-sided inverse for f on these sets: for all x ∈ U, g(f x) = x, and for all y ∈ V, f(g y) = y,
  - g is complex differentiable on V (DifferentiableOn ℂ g V).
- `by sorry`: proof omitted (not relevant to faithfulness of the statement’s translation per instructions).

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original statement: f: ℂ → ℂ is analytic (i.e., holomorphic on ℂ) and f'(z0) ≠ 0. Conclusion: f is a local diffeomorphism at z0 (locally invertible with analytic inverse).
- Lean statement’s conclusion matches the intended local invertibility with analytic inverse: it provides open neighborhoods U of z0 and V = f(U), a local inverse g defined on V with f ∘ g = id_V and g ∘ f = id_U, and g is holomorphic (DifferentiableOn ℂ on the open set V).
- However, hypotheses differ: the Lean code assumes only `HasDerivAt f a z0` and `a ≠ 0`, i.e., f is complex differentiable at the single point z0 with nonzero derivative. It does not assume f is analytic (holomorphic) on a neighborhood of z0 (let alone on all of ℂ). This is strictly weaker than the natural language hypothesis and is generally insufficient for the inverse function theorem in the holomorphic category. Thus the Lean theorem claims a stronger result under weaker assumptions.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- They are different. The core mathematical content in the conclusion matches what “local diffeomorphism (with analytic inverse)” expresses, but the Lean theorem omits the analyticity hypothesis and replaces it with a much weaker pointwise differentiability assumption. That is not a faithful translation of the original problem.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced; the statement is otherwise well-formed and uses standard Mathlib notions.

Given this significant mismatch in assumptions, the translation is not faithful despite the right shape of the conclusion.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library.
- Docstring explains the intended theorem: In a metric space, if every sequence has a convergent subsequence, then the space is compact.
- The theorem `metric_space_sequentially_compact_implies_compact_space {α : Type _} [MetricSpace α]` sets up a type α with a metric space structure.
- Hypothesis `h : ∀ u : ℕ → α, ∃ φ : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono φ ∧ ∃ x : α, ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, dist (u (φ n)) x < ε` states: for every sequence `u : ℕ → α`, there exists a strictly increasing function `φ : ℕ → ℕ` (an increasing subsequence selector) and a point `x : α` such that for every ε > 0, there exists an N with `dist (u (φ n)) x < ε` for all `n ≥ N`. This is precisely: every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
- Conclusion `CompactSpace α`: the entire space α is compact in the open-cover sense.
- `by sorry`: No proof provided, which is acceptable here since we are only auditing the statement's faithfulness.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: In a metric space X, if every sequence has a convergent subsequence, then every open cover of X has a finite subcover.
- Lean statement: In a metric space α, if every sequence has a convergent subsequence (as formalized via existence of strictly monotone φ and a limit point x satisfying the ε–N criterion), then α is a `CompactSpace`, i.e., every open cover has a finite subcover.
- This is exactly the same mathematical content: sequential compactness implies compactness in metric spaces.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary placeholder or vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions (`MetricSpace`, `StrictMono`, `dist`, `CompactSpace`) are standard Mathlib concepts.
- The Lean theorem asserts compactness of the entire space via the typeclass `CompactSpace`, which is equivalent to the open-cover compactness property requested.
- The subsequence is correctly modeled with a strictly monotone index function.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Conclusion: Faithful translation with no discrepancies.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib: Use Mathlib library.
- The theorem taylor_second_order_uniform_on_compact is stated for:
  • n : ℕ, modeling R^n as (Fin n → ℝ).
  • U : Set (Fin n → ℝ), a subset of R^n.
  • f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ, a real-valued function on R^n.
  • hU_conv : Convex ℝ U, U is convex.
  • hC2 : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, f is C^2 on U (twice continuously differentiable on U in the Fréchet sense).
  • hHess : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) U, the second derivative (Hessian) is continuous on U. Here fderiv ℝ f x is the first Fréchet derivative at x (a continuous linear functional), and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the second derivative at x, viewed as a continuous linear map E → (E →L[ℝ] ℝ), i.e., a bilinear form via (H_x h) h.
- Conclusion: For every compact K ⊆ U, and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ ≤ δ and x + h ∈ U, one has
  | f (x + h) - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) h - (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  This is precisely a uniform second-order Taylor estimate on K, with the quadratic term given by 1/2 times the Hessian applied to (h, h), and a remainder bounded by ε‖h‖^2 uniformly in x ∈ K.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- ""Let f : R^n → R be C^2 and H_f continuous in a convex set U"": The hypotheses hU_conv, hC2, and hHess match this. Including both C^2 and continuity of the Hessian is slightly redundant (C^2 typically implies continuity of the second derivative), but it is consistent with the wording.
- ""Show that the second-order Taylor expansion is uniform on compact subsets of U"": The quantified conclusion universally over compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, yielding a δ > 0 that works uniformly for all x ∈ K and small h (with x + h ∈ U), matches the requested uniformity. The convexity of U ensures that when x and x + h are in U, the line segment between them lies in U, which is standard for deriving Taylor estimates via integration along the segment. The use of (Fin n → ℝ) with its norm is a standard formalization of R^n in mathlib; the particular choice of norm does not affect the validity of the uniform O(‖h‖^2) estimate in finite dimensions.
- The expression uses the first derivative and the second derivative (Hessian) exactly in the expected Taylor polynomial with the factor 1/2.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain/codomain and differentiability class: Matches.
- Convexity requirement: Present as in the statement.
- Continuity of Hessian: Explicitly assumed.
- Uniformity over compact subsets: Expressed correctly by the ε-δ quantifiers with K ⊆ U and IsCompact K.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: All terms are standard mathlib notions; no fake definitions.
- Slight redundancy in assumptions (C^2 plus continuity of Hessian) does not change meaning.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- closed_rectangle {n} (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : Set (Fin n → ℝ) := fun x => ∀ i, x i ∈ Icc (a i) (b i)
  This defines the axis-aligned closed rectangle in ℝ^n (represented as functions Fin n → ℝ) with sides [a_i, b_i] in each coordinate. It does not enforce a_i ≤ b_i in the definition, but such an assumption is later provided as a hypothesis to the theorem.

- rectangle_volume {n} (a b : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := ∏ i, (b i - a i)
  This defines the volume of the rectangle as the product of side lengths. This is only guaranteed to be nonnegative under the hypothesis a_i ≤ b_i.

  This asserts that for any function m_star from sets of ℝ^n to ℝ, one has m_star of the closed rectangle equals the product of side lengths, assuming a_i ≤ b_i. There are no assumptions that m_star is an outer measure, nor that it is the specific outer measure defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
The natural language statement is specific: m^* is the outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles, and the claim is m^*(R) equals the usual volume for a closed rectangle R. The Lean theorem, however, quantifies over an arbitrary function m_star : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ with no properties (not even being an outer measure), and claims equality for all such m_star. This is a huge overgeneralization and does not encode the required definition of outer measure nor its construction via coverings by open rectangles. Thus the key mathematical content is missing and the statement is not faithful.

The auxiliary definitions closed_rectangle and rectangle_volume are reasonable and non-vacuous. However, the central concept (the specific outer measure m^*) is entirely abstracted away into an arbitrary function. There is no use of Mathlib's OuterMeasure or Lebesgue outer measure machinery, nor any assumptions reflecting monotonicity, countable subadditivity, or the construction via open rectangle coverings.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: For the specific outer measure m^* on ℝ^n defined via open-rectangle coverings, m^*(R) = V(R) for closed rectangles R.
- Lean: For any function m_star from sets of ℝ^n to ℝ, m_star(closed_rectangle a b) = product(b_i - a_i).
These are not the same; the Lean statement is vastly stronger (and false in general) and ignores the defining properties of m^*. Therefore the translation is not faithful.

Additional minor notes: The product formula is consistent under the hypothesis h : ∀ i, a_i ≤ b_i. The domain ℝ^n is modeled as Fin n → ℝ, which is fine. The omission of the specific outer measure and its properties is the critical issue.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: f : ℂ → ℂ is a complex-valued function; r : ℝ is a real number; a : ℕ → ℂ is a sequence of complex numbers (intended as power series coefficients).
- Hypothesis h_series: 1 < r ∧ ∀ z, |z| ≤ 1 → (∑' k, a k * z^k) = f z. This states there is a power series with coefficients a that sums to f(z) for every z with |z| ≤ 1. The extra ""1 < r"" is present but unused in the statement.
- Hypothesis h0: f 0 ≠ 0.
- Conclusion: ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ m : ℕ, ∀ z : ℂ, |1 - ∑_{k=0}^m (a k)/(a 0) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The original assumes f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and f(0) ≠ 0, and concludes there exists C such that for all m ∈ ℕ and all z with |z| ≤ 1, |1 − ∑_{k=0}^m (f^{(k)}(0)/(k! f(0))) z^k| ≤ C |z|^{m+1}.

Comparisons:
- Coefficients: The code uses general power series coefficients a k with the hypothesis that the series equals f on |z| ≤ 1. Under standard complex analysis, if f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk, such a representation exists and a k = f^{(k)}(0)/k!, and a 0 = f(0). So replacing the derivative-normalized coefficients by a k/a 0 is reasonable as a formalization choice (a slight specialization of the hypotheses that follows from holomorphicity). This part is acceptable.
- Domain of z: The key mismatch is that the Lean conclusion has no restriction on z; it quantifies over all z ∈ ℂ. The original statement restricts to |z| ≤ 1. This makes the Lean statement strictly stronger (and generally false) than the intended one and thus not faithful.
- Holomorphicity vs series hypothesis: The code does not assume holomorphicity directly but assumes a globally valid power series on the closed unit disk equaling f, which is stronger than needed but acceptable as a reasonable replacement hypothesis (as noted in the comment). This is a permissible specialization per the guidelines.
- Use of r: The parameter r with 1 < r in h_series is unused in the conclusion; this is harmless but superfluous.
- Division by a 0: The code divides by a 0; from h_series, plugging z = 0 yields a 0 = f 0, and with h0 this ensures a 0 ≠ 0. So this matches the intent of dividing by f(0).

Final check:
- The primary discrepancy is the missing constraint |z| ≤ 1 in the conclusion. Therefore, the Lean statement does not faithfully translate the natural language statement.

- The theorem `hasFDerivAt_eq_zero_of_isLocalMin` states: For `f : E → ℝ`, `x0 : E`, and `f' : E →L[ℝ] ℝ` (a continuous linear map from E to ℝ), if `hd : HasFDerivAt f f' x0` (f has Fréchet derivative f' at x0) and `hmin : IsLocalMin f x0` (f attains a local minimum at x0), then `f' = 0` (the zero continuous linear map).

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: “Let X be a normed vector space. Show that if f : X → ℝ is differentiable at x0 ∈ X and f attains a local minimum at x0, then Df(x0) = 0 as an element of L(X,ℝ).”
- Lean uses `HasFDerivAt f f' x0` to express differentiability at x0 with Fréchet derivative f', and concludes `f' = 0` in `E →L[ℝ] ℝ` (the space of continuous linear maps from E to ℝ). This exactly matches “Df(x0) = 0 ∈ L(X,ℝ)”.
- `IsLocalMin f x0` is the standard Mathlib predicate for a local minimum. No placeholders or vacuous definitions are used; all are standard Mathlib notions.
- Domain is a real normed vector space, codomain ℝ; this aligns with the natural language. The type of derivative is the Fréchet derivative, which is the appropriate interpretation in this context.

Final check:
- The two statements are the same: differentiability (Fréchet) at x0 and local minimum implies the derivative is the zero linear functional. No extra or missing hypotheses, no generalization or specialization beyond the intended setting. No auxiliary definitions or cheating.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem uniform_second_order_taylor_on_compact is stated for f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ (i.e., f : ℝ^n → ℝ), two sets U, K ⊆ ℝ^n, with assumptions:
  - hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U: f is C^2 on the set U (in the on-set sense used by Mathlib: derivatives up to order 2 exist and are continuous on U, as a property relative to U).
  - hU : Convex ℝ U: U is convex.
  - hK : IsCompact K: K is compact.
  - hKsub : K ⊆ U: K is contained in U.
- Conclusion: For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all increments h with ‖h‖ ≤ δ and x + h ∈ U, the second-order Taylor remainder is bounded by ε ‖h‖^2, namely
  | f (x + h) - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) h - (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the Fréchet derivative (a continuous linear map) of f at x (in the ambient sense), and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the derivative at x of the map y ↦ fderiv ℝ f y, which when applied twice to h gives the quadratic form corresponding to the Hessian at x applied to (h,h).

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Intended mathematical statement: If f is C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U, then the second-order Taylor expansion holds uniformly on compact subsets K ⊆ U. This means for every ε>0 there exists δ>0 such that for all x ∈ K and all small h with x, x+h ∈ U, the error |f(x+h) − f(x) − ⟨∇f(x), h⟩ − 1/2 h^T H_f(x) h| ≤ ε ‖h‖^2.
- The code’s quantifiers and the uniformity on K match the standard “uniform on compact subsets” formulation, including the condition x+h ∈ U.
- The assumptions hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U and Convex U are appropriate formalizations of “f is C^2 with continuous Hessian on a convex set U”. ContDiffOn 2 indeed encodes the existence and continuity of derivatives up to order 2 on U.

Key discrepancy:
- The theorem statement uses the ambient derivatives fderiv ℝ f x and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x. Under the hypothesis ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U, f is only guaranteed to be C^2 on the set U in the on-set sense; at boundary points of U one generally only has within-U derivatives (fderivWithin), not necessarily the ambient Frechet derivatives fderiv. The natural statement concerns Taylor expansion within U (i.e., along increments staying in U), so the correct formalization should use fderivWithin ℝ f U x and the corresponding second derivative within U (or require U to be open). Using the ambient fderiv and its derivative at x asserts a stronger statement that may not be justified by ContDiffOn on U unless U is open or one restricts to interior points.
- The code does not assume U is open, nor does it use within derivatives, so there is a mismatch at boundary points.

Final comparison:
- Aside from this derivative-within vs ambient derivative issue, the statement matches the intended uniformity, norms, and quadratic remainder involving the Hessian. However, this issue is substantive: the Lean theorem as stated requires ambient derivatives at x and thus is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement on a possibly non-open convex set U.

Therefore, the translation is almost correct but not fully faithful due to the missing use of within derivatives (or an openness assumption on U).

- The Lean code works over ℝ (`a : ℕ → ℝ`) using real absolute value. The natural language did not specify a field, but typically this statement is about real series. This is a harmless specialization and acceptable per the guidelines.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions: the definition of conditional convergence is legitimate and standard. No extraneous auxiliary definitions.
Thus the translation is faithful.

- import Mathlib, open Set: standard imports and namespace opening.
- def RiemannIntegrableOn (f : ℝ → ℝ) (s : Set ℝ) : Prop := True: This defines a placeholder predicate for “Riemann integrable on s” as the trivially true proposition. This is a vacuous stand-in and not a faithful representation of Riemann integrability.
- Theorem uniform_continuous_bounded_on_riemann_integrable_on (a b : ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hab : a < b) (huc : UniformContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) (hb : BoundedOn (Icc a b) f) : RiemannIntegrableOn f (Icc a b) := by sorry: The statement asserts that if a < b, f is uniformly continuous on [a, b], and bounded on [a, b], then f is Riemann integrable on [a, b]. However, the conclusion uses the placeholder predicate RiemannIntegrableOn = True, so the theorem is vacuous. The proof is left as sorry, which is acceptable for this auditing task, provided the statement itself is faithful; but the predicate is not faithful.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Suppose f : [a, b] → ℝ is bounded and uniformly continuous. Prove f is Riemann integrable.
- Lean: Works with f : ℝ → ℝ restricted to Icc a b (equivalent to a function defined on [a, b]). Assumes boundedness and uniform continuity on Icc a b, and concludes Riemann integrability on Icc a b. There is a small specialization a < b (excluding the degenerate case a = b), which is a mild restriction and would be acceptable in a faithful formalization.
- Critical issue: RiemannIntegrableOn is defined as True, a vacuous placeholder, not the actual Mathlib notion. This violates the guideline against vacuous auxiliary definitions and makes the formal statement non-faithful to the intended mathematical content.

Final check:
- The intended mathematical claim and the Lean theorem shape align conceptually (bounded + uniformly continuous ⇒ Riemann integrable on [a, b]).
- But the key predicate is replaced by a vacuous definition, so the translation is not faithful.
- Minor discrepancy: requiring a < b instead of a ≤ b; acceptable as a slight specialization, but overshadowed by the vacuous predicate.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to the vacuous integrability definition. If that were replaced with a legitimate Mathlib predicate, the statement would be faithful (modulo the a < b specialization).

- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard library; fine.
- `def conditionally_convergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := Summable a ∧ ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)`: Defines ""conditionally convergent"" for a real series as: the series converges but does not converge absolutely. This matches the standard mathematical definition.
- `theorem conditional_convergence_of_convergent_nonabsolutely {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h1 : Summable a) (h2 : ¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)) : conditionally_convergent a := by sorry`: States that if the series converges (`Summable a`) and the series of absolute values does not converge (`¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)`), then the series is conditionally convergent as defined above. The `sorry` is a placeholder for the proof, which is acceptable for this auditing task.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: If ∑ a_n converges and ∑ |a_n| diverges, then the series is conditionally convergent.
- The Lean theorem precisely captures this: `Summable a` corresponds to convergence of ∑ a_n, and `¬ Summable (fun n => |a n|)` corresponds to divergence of ∑ |a_n|. The conclusion is exactly the defined notion of conditional convergence.
- Minor indexing mismatch (natural language from n=1 vs. Lean indexing from ℕ = 0) is a standard harmless technicality; summability is invariant under finite shifts.

Checks against guidelines:
- No vacuous placeholders: the auxiliary definition `conditionally_convergent` is a proper, standard definition using Mathlib's `Summable` and absolute value.
- Uses standard Mathlib notions.
- The theorem statement aligns exactly with the original statement; no extraneous generalizations or restrictions beyond using ℝ (which matches the absolute value context).

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : Nat}`: Work in dimension n.
- `variable (mstar : Set (Fin n -> ℝ) → ENNReal)`: Introduce an arbitrary function mstar from subsets of ℝ^n (represented as functions `Fin n → ℝ`) to extended nonnegative reals. No structure (like outer measure) is imposed here.
- `variable (mstar_countable_subadditive : ∀ (fs : ℕ → Set (Fin n -> ℝ)), mstar (⋃ i, fs i) ≤ ∑' i, mstar (fs i))`: Assume a countable subadditivity property for mstar over countable unions. This mirrors a key axiom of outer measures, but is only a standalone assumption, not tied to any definition of mstar.
- `theorem outer_measure_union_le {A B : Set (Fin n -> ℝ)} : mstar (A ∪ B) ≤ mstar A + mstar B := by sorry`: State that for any sets A,B, we have finite subadditivity for mstar.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: m* is the specific outer measure on ℝ^n defined via coverings by countably many open rectangles (i.e., Lebesgue outer measure). Prove finite subadditivity: m*(A ∪ B) ≤ m*(A) + m*(B).
- The code: Treats mstar as an arbitrary set function, not specified to be the outer measure built from open rectangles. It does introduce a general countable subadditivity assumption, which would be sufficient to derive the desired inequality. However, the theorem statement itself does not include this assumption as a hypothesis; it only states the inequality for any mstar, with no assumptions. Thus, the Lean theorem is strictly stronger (and generally false) and not faithful to the intended context.
- Additionally, the code does not tie mstar to the specific construction via coverings by open rectangles. A slight generalization would be acceptable if the necessary outer measure property (e.g., countable subadditivity) were included as a hypothesis in the theorem; but since it is not referenced in the theorem statement, the translation fails.

Final check:
- Are the two statements the same? No. The natural statement is about a specific outer measure (Lebesgue outer measure) and finite subadditivity, while the Lean theorem asserts finite subadditivity for an arbitrary function mstar without any hypothesis. The presence of a separate variable `mstar_countable_subadditive` does not fix this, because it is not included in the theorem’s statement.

No vacuous placeholder definitions are made, but the key assumption is omitted from the theorem’s type, making the translation unfaithful.

- `variable {F : Type _} [NormedAddCommGroup F] [NormedSpace 𝕜 F]`: Similarly, F is a normed vector space over 𝕜.
- The theorem `linear_map_bounded_implies_continuous (A : E →ₗ[𝕜] F) (h : ∃ C, 0 ≤ C ∧ ∀ x, ‖A x‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖) : Continuous (A : E → F)` states: Let A be a linear map from E to F over 𝕜. If there exists a constant C ≥ 0 such that for all x in E, the norm of A x is bounded by C times the norm of x, then A (as a function E → F) is continuous.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:

- The Lean theorem precisely captures this: A is a linear map `E →ₗ[𝕜] F`, bounded by the stated inequality (with an explicit nonnegativity condition on C, a harmless standard convention), and concludes continuity. The ambient structures (normed vector spaces over a normed field) match.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- The code uses the standard bound `∥A x∥ ≤ C * ∥x∥` with `0 ≤ C`, equivalent to the usual boundedness definition. 
- The notation L(X,Y) in different texts can denote bounded linear maps; here the statement explicitly includes ""linear and bounded"", and the Lean code models A as a linear map with a separate boundedness hypothesis. This aligns with the intended meaning.

The natural language statement asks about the function f(x) = e^x cos(x), proving it is analytic, finding a power series at 0, and determining the radius of convergence. The Lean code does not:
- define the real function e^x cos(x),
- mention analyticity, power series, or radii of convergence,
- work over the reals or complex numbers, or any topological/algebraic structures needed for analysis.
Instead, it defines a completely different function on Nat and proves a trivial proposition unrelated to the task.

The two problems are entirely different. The Lean code is unrelated to the original statement and contains no faithful translation. The theorem is vacuous and not a legitimate formalization of the intended result.

Therefore, the translation fails completely.

  This states: Let f: ℂ → ℂ. Assume hf: f is holomorphic on Set.univ (i.e., on all of ℂ). Assume h0: for all z, f z ≠ 0 (nonvanishing). Then there exists a function g: ℂ → ℂ such that g is holomorphic on Set.univ (entire) and for all z, Complex.exp (g z) = f z (i.e., f = exp ∘ g).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: “Let f: ℂ → ℂ be analytic and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g.”
- The code’s hypotheses match: “analytic on ℂ” corresponds to `IsHolomorphicOn f Set.univ` (entire), and nonvanishing `∀ z, f z ≠ 0`. The conclusion matches: existence of a holomorphic g on ℂ with `exp g = f` pointwise.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Domain and codomain are both ℂ in both statements.
- “analytic” vs. “holomorphic on all of ℂ” are equivalent in this context.
- Nonvanishing assumption is identical.
- Conclusion states existence of entire logarithm g with exp g = f; exactly the same.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof (allowed for this audit).

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- It declares a theorem `outer_measure_disjoint_rectangles` with parameters `n N : ℕ`, where the ambient space is `(Fin n → ℝ)`, i.e., ℝ^n.
- `mstar : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ENNReal` is an arbitrary function from sets of ℝ^n to extended nonnegative reals. There is no assumption that `mstar` is an outer measure, let alone the Lebesgue outer measure.
- `R : Fin N → Set (Fin n → ℝ)` is an N-indexed family of subsets of ℝ^n. There is no assumption that these sets are open rectangles (or even measurable).
- `hd : ∀ i j : Fin N, i ≠ j → (R i ∩ R j) = ∅` states the family `R i` is pairwise disjoint.
- The conclusion: `mstar (⋃ i, R i) = ∑ i, mstar (R i)`, i.e., the value of `mstar` on the union equals the sum of its values, over a finite index set.

Assessment vs the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement specifies: (1) `m^*` is the outer measure on ℝ^n (specifically the Lebesgue outer measure), and (2) `R_k` are pairwise disjoint open rectangles. The desired conclusion is finite additivity for this specific outer measure on this specific class of sets.
- The Lean statement omits both crucial features: `mstar` is not assumed to be an outer measure (or Lebesgue outer measure), and the `R i` are not assumed to be open rectangles (or measurable). Thus the formal statement is far more general and, as stated, generally false.
- The indexing: the Lean code uses `N` (number of rectangles) and `n` (dimension), which is a harmless clarification compared to the ambiguous use of `n` for both in the natural language. This part is fine.
- There are no auxiliary definitions; however, the missing assumptions make the statement not a faithful formalization of the original problem.

Final check:
- The Lean theorem does not encode that `mstar` is the outer measure on ℝ^n nor that the sets are open rectangles. Therefore, the math problems are different in essential ways. The code is not a faithful translation.

- The environment assumes E is a real normed vector space (NormedAddCommGroup E, NormedSpace ℝ E), generalizing ℝ^n.
- K is a subset of E, f : E → ℝ, x0 : E.
- Hypotheses:
  - hK : IsCompact K — K is compact.
  - hcont : ContinuousOn f K — f is continuous on K.
  - hdiff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (interior K) — f is differentiable on the interior of K.
  - hx : x0 ∈ interior K — x0 lies in the interior of K (hence x0 ∈ K as well).
  - hmax : ∀ y ∈ K, f y ≤ f x0 — f attains a maximum over K at x0.
- Conclusion: fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0 — the Fréchet derivative of f at x0 is the zero linear map.

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
Original: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ continuous on a compact set K ⊂ ℝ^n and differentiable on int(K), if f attains a maximum at x0 ∈ int(K), then Df(x0) = 0.
- The Lean version exactly matches the structure: compact K, f continuous on K, differentiable on int(K), x0 in int(K), and f has a maximum at x0 over K; conclusion: derivative at x0 is zero.
- The Lean statement is a slight generalization from ℝ^n to any real normed vector space E, which is acceptable and standard for this result.
- The maximum condition is encoded as ∀ y ∈ K, f y ≤ f x0, and hx ensures x0 ∈ K via interior K ⊆ K.
- The derivative is expressed as fderiv ℝ f x0 = 0, which corresponds to Df(x0) = 0.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; this is a single theorem statement (proof omitted with sorry, which is acceptable for translation auditing).

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain generalization (E instead of ℝ^n) does not change the essence and is a standard strengthening; still faithful.
- Includes compactness and continuity as in the original.
- Correctly requires differentiability on interior K and x0 ∈ interior K.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original asks: Show f is analytic; find a power series for f at 0; find its radius of convergence.
- The code defines f over ℂ (a reasonable generalization from ℝ). It does present a correct power series equality on |z| < 1, which addresses the second part.
- However, it does not state that f is analytic (neither globally where defined nor at 0). While the power series equality on |z|<1 would imply analyticity on that disk, the code does not claim analyticity explicitly.
- The “radius of convergence” theorem is entirely vacuous (1 = 1) and does not express the radius of convergence of the series. So the third requirement is not translated at all.

3) Final comparison:
- Differences:
  - Missing an analyticity statement (e.g., AnalyticAt ℂ f 0 or AnalyticOn ℂ f (ball 0 1)).

This is a standard and correct generalization; specializing R = ℝ yields exactly the original statement. The variable name `t` vs `X` is immaterial.

- `(A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ))`: `A` is a continuous linear map from ℝ^n to ℝ^m (as normed spaces over ℝ). In Lean, the derivative is a continuous linear map, so this is the right type to use.
- `(x : Fin n → ℝ)`: An arbitrary point x ∈ ℝ^n.
- Conclusion `HasFDerivAt A A x`: The function `A` has Fréchet derivative `A` at the point `x`. Here `A` is coerced to a function for the left occurrence and is the continuous linear map derivative for the right occurrence. This asserts differentiability at every x and that the derivative equals A itself.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let A: ℝ^n → ℝ^m be linear. Prove A is differentiable at every x and DA(x) = A (as a linear map).
- Lean: For A a continuous linear map between `(Fin n → ℝ)` and `(Fin m → ℝ)`, `HasFDerivAt A A x` for all `x`.
- The use of `Fin n → ℝ` faithfully models ℝ^n; `HasFDerivAt` is the standard notion of Fréchet differentiability; the derivative is a continuous linear map. The only apparent strengthening is requiring `A` to be a continuous linear map rather than merely linear, but in finite-dimensional real vector spaces every linear map is continuous, so this matches the intended mathematical content. Thus the Lean statement is a faithful formalization.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which is allowed by the task so long as the statement is correct and faithful.

Final check: The two problems are the same in meaning. The Lean statement matches the differentiability everywhere and identifies the derivative with `A` itself. Any difference (explicit continuity/type of A) is standard and harmless in finite-dimensional settings, making this an appropriate formalization.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library.
- `def Riemann_integrable_on {n : Nat} (f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) (R : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : Prop := True`:
  This defines a predicate `Riemann_integrable_on f R` to always be `True`. It is a vacuous placeholder and does not encode any actual notion of Riemann integrability or any conditions on the domain `R`.
- `theorem integrable_on_max_min ... (hf : Riemann_integrable_on f R) (hg : Riemann_integrable_on g R) : Riemann_integrable_on (fun x => max (f x) (g x)) R ∧ Riemann_integrable_on (fun x => min (f x) (g x)) R := by sorry`:
  This theorem claims: if `f` and `g` are Riemann integrable on `R` (according to the predicate above), then the pointwise `max` and `min` are also Riemann integrable on `R`. However, since `Riemann_integrable_on` is defined to be `True`, both the hypotheses and the conclusions are trivially true for any `f, g, R`. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: For a closed rectangle `R ⊂ ℝ^n`, if `f, g : R → ℝ` are Riemann integrable, then `φ(x) = max{f(x), g(x)}` and `ψ(x) = min{f(x), g(x)}` are Riemann integrable on `R`.
- The Lean code does not faithfully represent this:
  - The predicate `Riemann_integrable_on` is vacuous (`True`). This is a major red flag: it does not capture Riemann integrability at all.
  - The domain `R` is an arbitrary set `Set (Fin n → ℝ)` with no requirement that it is a closed rectangle. The natural language requires specifically a closed rectangle in `ℝ^n`.
  - The theorem statement, if one were to replace the placeholder with a real integrability predicate over rectangles, would be close to the intended claim (max/min preserve integrability). However, as written, it is entirely vacuous.

Final comparison:
- The code as written is not a legitimate, faithful translation. It relies on a placeholder definition that makes everything trivially true and omits the closed rectangle assumption. Therefore, it fails the faithfulness criterion.
- If the vacuous predicate were replaced with a genuine Riemann integrability predicate over closed rectangles (and possibly encoding that `R` is a closed rectangle), the theorem statement would then be faithful to the natural language claim. Given this, it fits the rubric category: makes up vacuous definitions but, if fixed, the final theorem would be faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and the `open` lines just set up the environment and namespaces.
- The theorem is named `exists_holomorphic_g_eq_exp_of_ne_zero` and concerns a function `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
- Hypothesis `hf : AnalyticOn ℂ f univ` means that `f` is analytic (holomorphic) on the entire complex plane, i.e., `f` is entire.
- Hypothesis `hf_ne : ∀ z, f z ≠ 0` asserts that `f` has no zeros anywhere on ℂ.
- The conclusion `∃ g : ℂ → ℂ, AnalyticOn ℂ g univ ∧ f = exp ∘ g` states that there exists a function `g : ℂ → ℂ` which is analytic on all of ℂ (thus entire/holomorphic) and such that `f = exp ∘ g`, i.e., `f(z) = e^{g(z)}` for all `z`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language statement: ""Let f be entire and suppose f(z) ≠ 0 for all z. Show that there exists a holomorphic g with f = e^g."" This exactly matches the Lean theorem's hypotheses and conclusion: entire `f` (via `AnalyticOn ℂ f univ`), nonvanishing everywhere (`∀ z, f z ≠ 0`), and existence of a holomorphic/entire `g` on ℂ with `f = exp ∘ g`.
- Using `AnalyticOn ℂ _ univ` for “entire” and function equality with `exp ∘ g` are standard and faithful. On ℂ, “holomorphic” over the whole domain is the same as “entire,” so there is no mismatch in strength.
- There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the code relies on Mathlib’s real predicates. The proof is omitted (by `sorry`), which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Final check:
- The two problems are the same: both assert existence of a global holomorphic logarithm of a nonvanishing entire function on ℂ.
- No discrepancies found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- import Mathlib / open BigOperators: bring in Mathlib and big-Σ/Π/∑ notation.
- def cauchy_product (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ := ∑ i in Finset.range (n+1), a i * b (n - i)
  This defines the nth term of the Cauchy product (convolution) of two real sequences a and b as c_n = ∑_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}. This is the standard Cauchy product term.
- theorem cauchy_product_of_absolutely_summable {a b : ℕ → ℝ} (ha : Summable fun n => |a n|) (hb : Summable fun n => |b n|) : Summable fun n => |cauchy_product a b n| ∧ tsum (cauchy_product a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b) := by sorry
  Intended meaning: If a and b are absolutely summable real series, then (i) the Cauchy product series is absolutely summable and (ii) its sum equals the product of the sums.

  However, as written, there is a syntactic/precedence issue. In Lean, the expression
    Summable fun n => |cauchy_product a b n| ∧ tsum (cauchy_product a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b)
  is parsed as
    Summable (fun n => (|cauchy_product a b n| ∧ tsum (cauchy_product a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b)))
  i.e., a Summable predicate applied to a function ℕ → Prop (since ∧ yields a Prop), which is ill-typed. The intended statement should have parentheses around the Summable part:
    (Summable (fun n => |cauchy_product a b n|)) ∧ (tsum (cauchy_product a b) = (tsum a) * (tsum b))
  Without these parentheses, the theorem statement does not correctly express the conjunction; instead it attempts to feed a Prop-valued sequence into Summable.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The definition of cauchy_product is correct and faithful.
- The hypotheses (ha and hb: absolute summability of a and b) match the natural-language assumptions (absolute convergence).
- The conclusions intended (absolute summability of the Cauchy product and equality of the sums) match the natural-language conclusions.
- But due to the missing parentheses, the formal statement is malformed: it does not actually state a conjunction of two conclusions; instead it states a single ill-typed Summable condition on a Prop-valued function. Thus, as written, it is not a faithful formalization.

3) Final comparison:
- Natural statement: If a, b are absolutely convergent, then their Cauchy product is absolutely convergent and its sum equals the product of sums.
- Lean code (intended): Exactly that, specialized to ℝ.
- Lean code (as written): Mis-parenthesized goal; the conjunction is inside the lambda, leading to an incorrect/ill-typed statement. This discrepancy prevents it from being a faithful translation.

Other notes:
- No vacuous definitions; cauchy_product is correct.
- Specialization to real sequences (ℝ) is a harmless specialization compared to the usual ℝ/ℂ statements.

Verdict: Near-perfect intent, but the theorem statement needs parentheses to be faithful. Hence not fully faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: E is a type with a NormedAddCommGroup structure (a normed abelian group). a : ℕ → E is a sequence. σ : ℕ ≃ ℕ is a bijection of ℕ (a rearrangement).
- Hypothesis h : Summable (fun n => ‖a n‖) means the series of norms ∑ ‖a n‖ converges (absolute convergence).
- Conclusion HasSum (fun n => a (σ n)) (tsum a) means the rearranged series ∑ a(σ n) converges and its sum equals tsum a (the sum of the original series, when it is summable).

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely, then any rearrangement has the same sum as the original series.
- Lean: Under absolute summability of a (via norms), for any rearrangement σ, the rearranged series has sum equal to tsum a. Since tsum a denotes the sum of a when a is summable, this encodes “the sum remains the same.” The use of σ : ℕ ≃ ℕ captures “any rearrangement.” The index ℕ (starting at 0) instead of {1,2,...} is a standard harmless reindexing.

Potential discrepancies:
- Generality: The Lean statement is in an arbitrary NormedAddCommGroup E (not necessarily complete), whereas the natural language statement is typically over ℝ or ℂ (complete). Absolute convergence of norms implies summability of a and equality of sums in complete spaces. Without a [CompleteSpace E] assumption, absolute convergence of norms does not necessarily imply a is summable in E; thus identifying the sum with tsum a is slightly delicate. This is a technical mismatch but does not indicate any vacuous or placeholder definition—just a slightly overgeneral setting. 
- The conclusion uses tsum a rather than explicitly stating “equals the original sum s,” but in mathlib, when a is summable, tsum a is that s.
- No auxiliary bogus definitions; only a theorem stub with a sorry proof, which is acceptable per the auditing rules.

Overall judgment:
- The code is a faithful formalization of the statement, up to a standard generalization to normed groups and minor indexing differences. The only noteworthy technical gap is the missing completeness assumption, which is a slight but meaningful mismatch. Still, the intent and content match closely.

- `variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)`: Introduce an arbitrary predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` on functions and sets. This is not tied to Mathlib's actual notion of Riemann integrability; it is just an uninterpreted symbol.
- The theorem:

  Natural language: For an arbitrary predicate `RiemannIntegrableOn` and arbitrary set R, if f and g satisfy this predicate on R, then so do af, f+g, and fg.
  Note: There is no assumption that R is a closed rectangle, nor that `RiemannIntegrableOn` is the Riemann integrability predicate. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but per instructions we judge the statement, not the proof.

2) Comparing to the original statement:
- Original: R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n. The predicate is the actual Riemann integrability on R (in the Riemann sense), and the claim is closure under scalar multiplication, addition, and multiplication. The content is specifically about the set of Riemann integrable functions on a closed rectangle forming an algebra.
- Lean: Uses an arbitrary set R (not necessarily a closed rectangle) and an arbitrary predicate named `RiemannIntegrableOn` (not tied to Mathlib, not defined). It asserts closure for this arbitrary predicate without any structural assumptions.

3) Differences and issues:
- Missing key hypothesis: R being a closed rectangle is not stated or used; R is an arbitrary set.
- Uninterpreted predicate: `RiemannIntegrableOn` is a free variable, not the Mathlib/Riemann integrability notion. This makes the theorem statement unrelated to the specific property in the natural language statement.
- No use of Mathlib's definitions for Riemann integrability or rectangles/boxes. The code does not even attempt to formalize those notions.
- While the operations on functions (af, f+g, fg) match the closure properties listed in the natural language statement, the foundational context (domain and integrability notion) is not captured at all.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is not a faithful translation. It generalizes and abstracts away the essential structure (closed rectangle, specific integrability notion) to the point of being unrelated. Hence it fails the faithfulness test.

- The theorem `rademacher_on_of_lipschitz_on (hL : LipschitzOnWith K f U) (hU : Convex ℝ U) : ∀ᵐ x ∂(MeasureTheory.Measure.volume.restrict U), DifferentiableAt ℝ f x` states:
  If f is K-Lipschitz on U (hypothesis `hL`) and U is convex (hypothesis `hU`), then for Lebesgue almost every x with respect to the Lebesgue measure restricted to U, f is differentiable at x (Fréchet differentiable over ℝ).
  This matches the standard Euclidean Rademacher theorem phrased on a convex subset U and uses Lebesgue measure (`volume.restrict U`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: “Suppose f : ℝ^n → ℝ is differentiable and Lipschitz on a convex set U. Show that f is differentiable almost everywhere on U (Rademacher's theorem in this context).”
- The Lean statement assumes only that f is Lipschitz on U and that U is convex, and concludes differentiability almost everywhere on U. This precisely captures the essence of Rademacher's theorem in this setting.
- The natural language includes an extra (and redundant) assumption that f is differentiable on U; if interpreted literally, that would make the conclusion trivial. The Lean version omits this redundant assumption and states the nontrivial Rademacher result. This is a slight generalization (weaker hypotheses) and is acceptable per the guidelines.
- Domain as `(Fin n → ℝ)` correctly models ℝ^n. The codomain is ℝ as in the statement. The measure used is Lebesgue restricted to U, which corresponds to “almost everywhere on U.”

3) Final comparison:
- Core claim matches: Lipschitz on a convex U implies differentiable a.e. on U with respect to Lebesgue measure.
- Difference: the natural language mentions “differentiable and Lipschitz,” but the Lean code only assumes Lipschitz. This is a benign generalization and aligns with the intended Rademacher theorem.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; the theorem statement is direct and standard. The code uses standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful formalization of the intended Rademacher statement; the only discrepancy is dropping a redundant hypothesis in the natural language phrasing.

- `DifferentiableAt ℝ f x` means f is (Fréchet) differentiable at x.

  Natural language: Let x be a real sequence with limit l (i.e., x_n → l). Then 0 ≤ max(l, 0). The hypothesis `h` formalizes the convergence x_n → l. The conclusion is simply the inequality 0 ≤ max(l,0), which is true for any real l and does not actually use the convergence beyond naming l.

2) Comparison to the original statement:
Original: Let {x_n} be convergent and define y_n = max{x_n, 0}. Show that lim y_n ≥ 0.
Mathematically, one typically uses continuity of t ↦ max(t,0) to conclude y_n → max(l,0), hence lim y_n = max(l,0) ≥ 0.
The Lean theorem, however, does not mention the sequence y_n, its limit, or the convergence of y_n. It only asserts the inequality 0 ≤ max(l,0). While this inequality is a component needed to conclude lim y_n ≥ 0 (once one has established lim y_n = max(l,0)), the theorem omits the crucial link that the limit of y_n equals max(l,0). Therefore, it does not faithfully state the desired conclusion about the limit of y_n.

3) Final check:
- Original asks: prove a fact about the limit of y_n.
- Lean code proves: an inequality about max(l,0), independent of y_n and without asserting y_n’s limit.
They are different: the Lean statement is strictly weaker and incomplete relative to the original goal. No vacuous definitions are present, but the formal statement fails to capture the original claim about the limit of the transformed sequence.

- The Lean statement precisely captures uniform convergence on [a,b] (via hu), continuity of g on [a,b] (via hg), and the convergence of the integrals of the products f_n·g to the integral of f·g over [a,b]. The use of Tendsto expresses the same limit equality.
- The requirement a ≤ b matches the implicit assumption in the interval [a,b]. The functions are defined on ℝ but the uniform convergence is restricted to x ∈ Icc a b, which matches the statement.
- The product is written explicitly as f_n n x * g x, corresponding to f_n g in the statement.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code and the natural statement are essentially the same mathematically. The minor technical choice of ≤ ε instead of < ε in the uniform convergence quantifier is a harmless variant. The Lean statement uses the interval integral (Lebesgue/Bochner formulation), which matches the intended Riemann/Lebesgue result on a compact interval under these hypotheses. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; no auxiliary definitions at all.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `variables {α : Type*} [CommRing α]`: We work over a commutative ring α (not necessarily a field or integral domain).
- `variable {n : Type*} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index set for rows and columns is a finite type n; matrices are n-by-n in the sense of having finitely many rows and columns indexed by n.
- `theorem matrix.det_zero_columns_linear_dependent {A : Matrix n n α} (h : Matrix.det A = 0) : ¬ LinearIndependent α (fun j => A.col j)`: If det(A) = 0, then the columns of A are linearly dependent (over α).
- `theorem matrix.det_ne_zero_columns_linear_independent {A : Matrix n n α} (h : Matrix.det A ≠ 0) : LinearIndependent α (fun j => A.col j)`: If det(A) ≠ 0, then the columns of A are linearly independent (over α).
- `theorem matrix.det_zero_rows_linear_dependent {A : Matrix n n α} (h : Matrix.det A = 0) : ¬ LinearIndependent α (fun i => A.row i)`: If det(A) = 0, then the rows of A are linearly dependent (over α).
- `theorem matrix.det_ne_zero_rows_linear_independent {A : Matrix n n α} (h : Matrix.det A ≠ 0) : LinearIndependent α (fun i => A.row i)`: If det(A) ≠ 0, then the rows of A are linearly independent (over α).
All four theorems are stated without proofs (using `by sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing rules as no vacuous auxiliary definitions are introduced.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
The natural language statement is the classical linear algebra fact: for an n-by-n matrix A, det(A) = 0 implies the columns (or rows) are linearly dependent, and det(A) ≠ 0 implies they are linearly independent. This is standard over a field (or at least an integral domain). The Lean code, however, states these results over an arbitrary commutative ring α: `[CommRing α]`.
- Over a general commutative ring with zero divisors, the implication “det(A) ≠ 0 ⇒ columns are linearly independent” is false. For example over Z/4Z, the 1×1 matrix [2] has det = 2 ≠ 0 but the single column vector (2) is not linearly independent since 2 • 2 = 0 in Z/4Z. Thus the second and fourth theorems are not valid in this generality.
- The first and third theorems (det = 0 ⇒ dependent) may also fail in full generality of commutative rings; in any case, the intended classical statement assumes a field (or at least an integral domain), which the code does not.
Therefore, the code overgeneralizes the base ring hypothesis in a way that makes the statements false, so it is not a faithful formalization of the intended theorem.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Scope: The natural language implicitly assumes a field (or integral domain). The Lean code assumes only a commutative ring. This is a significant mismatch and leads to false statements in the given generality.
- Content: The code does cover both columns and rows as requested and uses the standard Mathlib notions (Matrix.det, Matrix.col/row, LinearIndependent) without vacuous placeholders.
- Proofs: Omitted with `sorry`, which is fine for translation auditing.
Conclusion: Not faithful due to incorrect generality of the base ring.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: setup, fine.
- `def BoundedOn ... : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate named ""bounded on a set"" but defines it as `True`. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the actual notion of boundedness.
- `def HasRiemannIntegralOn ... : Prop := True`: Introduces a predicate intended to mean ""f has a Riemann integral over R with value I"", but again defines it as `True`. Another vacuous placeholder.
- The theorem `has_riemann_integral_on_of_rectangle_one_side_zero`:
  - Parameters: `a b : Fin n → ℝ` represent opposite corners of a product rectangle `R = ∏ Icc (a i) (b i)` in ℝ^n; `h_side : ∃ j, a j = b j` expresses that one coordinate has zero length (some side length 0). `f : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` is a function on ℝ^n. `hf : BoundedOn f R` is the hypothesis that f is bounded on R (but since `BoundedOn` is `True`, this conveys no actual information).
  - Conclusion: `HasRiemannIntegralOn f R 0`, i.e., f is Riemann integrable on R with integral 0 (but again this is vacuously true due to the placeholder definition).
Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Intended statement: If R ⊂ ℝ^n is a closed rectangle with one side of length 0, then every bounded function f: R → ℝ is Riemann integrable on R and the integral over R is 0.
- Structural match: The code encodes R as a product of closed intervals `Icc (a i) (b i)`, and `∃ j, a j = b j` matches the ""one side has length 0"" condition (allowing at least one zero-length side, which is fine). The function is defined on all of ℝ^n but required to be bounded on R, which is a harmless generalization. Minor technical gap: the code does not require `a i ≤ b i` for all i; if some `a i > b i`, `Icc (a i) (b i)` is empty. This is a small mismatch with the usual notion of rectangle, but the main problem lies elsewhere.
- Fatal issue: Both key predicates, `BoundedOn` and `HasRiemannIntegralOn`, are defined as `True`. These are vacuous placeholders and do not capture boundedness or Riemann integrability at all. Therefore the theorem statement is trivial and does not faithfully express the mathematical content.
Final assessment:
- Because of the vacuous auxiliary definitions, the translation is not faithful. If those definitions were replaced by legitimate Mathlib notions, the shape of the theorem would closely match the natural language statement (modulo the minor `a ≤ b` condition and the domain of f). Thus it fits the rubric for “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, the final theorem would be faithful.”

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: `x : ℕ → ℝ`, `l : ℝ`. So we have a real sequence x_n and a real number l (intended as its limit).

- Theorem `tendsto_min_of_tendsto`:
  Hypothesis: `h : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, |x n - l| < ε`. This is the epsilon–N definition of convergence of x_n to l.
  Conclusion: `∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, |min (x n) 0 - min l 0| < ε`. This asserts that min(x_n, 0) converges to min(l, 0) in the same epsilon–N sense. This matches the idea that the map t ↦ min(t, 0) is continuous, hence preserves limits.

- Theorem `limit_min_nonpos`:
  Hypothesis: same convergence hypothesis for x_n → l.
  Conclusion: `min l 0 ≤ 0`. This is a general inequality that holds for any real l; it does not mention the sequence y_n or its limit. The comment above says “In particular, the limit of y_n = min(x_n,0) is ≤ 0,” but the formal statement only concludes `min l 0 ≤ 0` and does not state anything about lim y_n.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural language statement: Given a convergent sequence {x_n} and y_n = min{x_n, 0}, show that lim y_n ≤ 0.
- The first theorem correctly formalizes that if x_n → l, then y_n = min(x_n, 0) → min(l, 0). This sets up the identification of the limit of y_n as min(l, 0).
- The second theorem proves only `min l 0 ≤ 0`, which is true but does not explicitly state anything about lim y_n. One would need to combine the first theorem (which identifies lim y_n with min(l, 0)) and the trivial inequality `min l 0 ≤ 0` to conclude the desired lim y_n ≤ 0. However, the code does not actually state the final conclusion as a theorem; the comment claims it, but the theorem statement does not reflect it.

3) Final comparison:
- Original: Prove lim y_n ≤ 0, where y_n = min(x_n,0) and {x_n} is convergent.
- Lean code: Provides a lemma that min(x_n,0) tends to min(l,0), and separately a lemma that min(l,0) ≤ 0. There is no theorem that explicitly states lim y_n ≤ 0. The intended conclusion follows from the two pieces, but the final theorem is not stated as such. So the translation is almost there but not literally faithful to the exact statement.

Given the above, while the ingredients are present to derive the desired result, the code as written does not explicitly state “lim y_n ≤ 0,” hence it is not fully faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- The ambient space E is a finite-dimensional real normed vector space (so it generalizes R^n). f : E → ℝ is the function; U, K are subsets of E.
- Hypotheses:
  - hU : Convex ℝ U — the set U is convex.
  - hK : IsCompact K — K is compact.
  - hsub : K ⊆ U — K is contained in U.
  - hf : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f U — f is C^2 on U (twice continuously Fréchet differentiable on U).
  - hess_cont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) U — the map x ↦ second derivative (Hessian, represented as a continuous linear map E →L (E →L ℝ)) is continuous on U.
- Conclusion:
  For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K, and for all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, we have
  | f(x+h) − f(x) − (fderiv ℝ f x) h − (1/2) * ((fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x) h) h | ≤ ε * ‖h‖^2.
  Here fderiv ℝ f x is the derivative (a continuous linear map E →L ℝ), and fderiv ℝ (fun y => fderiv ℝ f y) x is the second derivative as a continuous linear map from E to E →L ℝ. Applying it twice to h yields the bilinear form H_f(x)[h,h].

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ, C^2 on a convex set U, with Hessian H_f continuous on U, the remainder in the second-order Taylor approximation is o(‖h‖^2) uniformly on compact subsets of U.
- The Lean statement exactly encodes the uniform little-o characterization: for every ε>0 there is δ>0 such that for all x in a fixed compact K ⊆ U and all h with ‖h‖ < δ and x + h ∈ U, the remainder is bounded by ε‖h‖^2. This is the uniform o(‖h‖^2) property on K. The presence of x+h ∈ U ensures evaluation remains within U; convexity of U plus x, x+h ∈ U implies the segment [x, x+h] ⊆ U (relevant for proofs, but harmless in the statement). The second derivative is represented in Lean via fderiv of the derivative, evaluated bilinearly at (h,h) with the 1/2 factor.
- The Lean code works in any finite-dimensional real normed space E, a standard and faithful generalization of ℝ^n.
- The assumptions (C^2 on U and continuity of the Hessian on U) match the natural language; in fact, ContDiffOn ℝ 2 already implies continuity of the second derivative, so hess_cont is slightly redundant but consistent with the statement.

Step 3: Final comparison and differences.
- Content: Same theorem (uniform o(‖h‖^2) remainder for Taylor order 2 on compact subsets of a convex domain where f is C^2 and Hessian continuous).
- Scope: Slight generalization from ℝ^n to any finite-dimensional real normed vector space E — acceptable and faithful.
- Technical shape: Uses the epsilon-delta inequality form equivalent to the little-o statement. Includes the natural domain restriction x + h ∈ U.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all terms are standard Mathlib notions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement (indeed a standard, slightly more general version).

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`, `open BigOperators`: bring in Mathlib and big-Σ/∑ notation.
- The docstring states the intended theorem: if (a_n) is absolutely summable and (b_n) is summable, define c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}; then (c_n) is summable and its sum equals the product of the sums of (a_n) and (b_n).
- `theorem cauchy_product_summable (a b : ℕ → Real)`: a and b are real sequences indexed by ℕ.
- Hypotheses: `(ha : Summable (fun n => Real.abs (a n)))` says ∑ |a_n| converges (absolute summability of a). `(hb : Summable b)` says ∑ b_n converges.
- Conclusion: `Summable (fun n => ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), a k * b (n - k))` states the sequence c_n := ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} is summable. The second part `(tsum ... ) = (tsum a) * (tsum b)` asserts that the sum of the series with terms c_n equals the product of the sums of a and b. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` is the set {0,1,...,n}, and `n - k` is standard natural subtraction but since k ≤ n in the range, it corresponds to the integer difference n−k.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If ∑ a_n converges absolutely and ∑ b_n converges, define c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}. Then the series ∑ c_n converges and its sum equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n). The Lean statement exactly mirrors this: absolute summability of a, summability of b, the specific definition of c_n via the finite convolution, and the conclusion that ∑ c_n converges with sum equal to the product of sums. Using `tsum` captures “sum of the series,” and from absolute summability of a one can deduce `Summable a` in ℝ, so `tsum a` is indeed the sum of ∑ a_n.
- The indexing and finite sum bounds match precisely: `Finset.range (n + 1)` means 0 through n; the inner term is a_k * b_{n-k}.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code is a slight specialization to Real (the natural statement is typically over ℝ or ℂ); this is acceptable and faithful.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only a theorem statement with a `sorry` proof. The statement is standard and matches the Cauchy product theorem under absolute convergence of one factor.
- No discrepancies in hypotheses or conclusions: both require absolute convergence of a, ordinary convergence of b, and conclude convergence of the Cauchy product with the correct sum.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the natural statement.

The proof is omitted, but the statement is clear and standard.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: Let {a_k} be an enumeration of the rational numbers and define g_n(x) = ∑_{k=1}^n 2^{-k} f_n(x − a_k), with f_n(x) = x/(1 + (n x)^2). Show that g_n → 0 uniformly on ℝ.
- The Lean code defines f_n exactly as in the statement and defines g_n with the same finite weighted sum and shifts by a_k, correctly handling indices. The theorem then asserts uniform convergence of g_n to 0 on ℝ in the precise epsilon-N sense.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is that the Lean theorem quantifies over an arbitrary sequence a : ℕ → ℝ, rather than specifically an enumeration of the rationals. This is a slight generalization: the uniform convergence holds regardless of what the a_k are, so the Lean statement is stronger and still faithful to the intended result. There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; all definitions are legitimate and match the mathematics. Indexing and weights are correctly implemented. The uniform convergence is correctly formulated.

Conclusion: The Lean code is a faithful (indeed slightly more general) translation of the natural language statement.

- variable {α : Type _}: We work over an arbitrary type α (not specified to be ℝ^n).
- def IsClosedRectangle (R : Set α) : Prop := True: A placeholder predicate asserting “R is a closed rectangle,” but it is defined as True for all sets. Vacuous.
- def RiemannIntegrableOn (f : α → ℝ) (R : Set α) : Prop := True: Placeholder for Riemann integrability on R; always true. Vacuous.
- def outer_measure_zero (E : Set α) : Prop := True: Placeholder for “E has outer measure zero,” always true. Vacuous.
- def integral_on (f : α → ℝ) (R : Set α) : ℝ := 0: Placeholder integral that is always 0 for any f and R. Vacuous.
- def IsClosedSet (E : Set α) : Prop := True: Placeholder for closedness, always true. Vacuous.

Theorem integral_eq_of_equal_off_null:
- Hypotheses:
  - hR : IsClosedRectangle R (vacuous)
  - hf : RiemannIntegrableOn f R (vacuous)
  - hg : RiemannIntegrableOn g R (vacuous)
  - hEsub : E ⊆ R (a real inclusion hypothesis)
  - hEclosed : IsClosedSet E (vacuous)
  - hEm0 : outer_measure_zero E (vacuous)
  - hfg : ∀ x ∈ R \ E, f x = g x (real content: f=g off E)
- Conclusion: integral_on f R = integral_on g R. But since integral_on is constantly 0, this is trivial regardless of the hypotheses.
- Proof: by sorry (left as a placeholder, but Lean allows sorry).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original statement: R ⊆ ℝ^n is a closed rectangle; f, g: R → ℝ are Riemann integrable; E ⊆ R is closed with outer measure zero; f = g on R \ E; conclude ∫_R f = ∫_R g.

Issues in the Lean code:
- The ambient type α is arbitrary, not fixed to ℝ^n; no Euclidean structure is assumed. The notion of “closed rectangle” is encoded by a predicate that is always true (thus meaningless and not tied to ℝ^n).
- Riemann integrability is a placeholder Prop := True; nothing enforced about integrability.
- Closedness and outer measure zero are placeholders (True), not Mathlib’s notions.
- The integral is defined as integral_on f R := 0, so the theorem’s conclusion holds trivially, independent of the actual content.
- The theorem uses ‘sorry’ for the proof and vacuous definitions, so it does not establish the genuine mathematical fact.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two statements the same?
No. The Lean code does not faithfully formalize the original theorem. It replaces all key concepts (closed rectangle in ℝ^n, Riemann integrable, closed set, outer measure zero, and the integral itself) with vacuous placeholders, and even generalizes the ambient space to an arbitrary type α. The conclusion is trivialized by defining the integral to be zero. Thus, it is not a legitimate translation.

Grading rationale:
- Multiple vacuous placeholder definitions (True/0) invalidate the core content.
- If these placeholders were replaced with genuine Mathlib notions and α were specialized to ℝ^n (or EuclideanSpace), the shape of the theorem statement would match the intended result. Hence, while currently unfaithful, the skeleton mirrors the desired structure. This fits the rubric case: “makes up vacuous definitions but if fixed, then the final theorem/definition is faithful.”
- Therefore, faithful_score = 0 and grade = 6.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {α : Type*} [MetricSpace α]`: We are working in an arbitrary metric space α.
- `theorem is_open_iff_forall_mem_ball_subset {S : Set α} : IsOpen S ↔ (∀ p ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, Metric.ball p ε ⊆ S) := by sorry`: This states that for a subset S of α, S is open if and only if for every point p in S there exists ε > 0 such that the open ball centered at p with radius ε is contained in S.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: In a metric space, S is open iff for every p in S there is ε > 0 such that B(p, ε) ⊆ S. The Lean statement exactly matches this, with `Metric.ball p ε` representing the open ball B(p, ε), and `IsOpen S` representing that S is open.

3) Final check for differences:
- The domain (metric space), the set S, the universal quantification over p ∈ S, the existence of ε > 0, and the inclusion of the open ball in S are all present and correctly formalized. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions. No differences in meaning or scope.

Conclusion: The code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `def harmonic_on (U : Set (ℝ × ℝ)) (f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := True`: Introduces a placeholder predicate `harmonic_on U f` that is defined to be always true. This does not capture the analytic notion of harmonicity (twice continuously differentiable with f_xx + f_yy = 0).
- `theorem maximum_principle_harmonic ...`: States: For a set `U ⊆ ℝ × ℝ` with `IsOpen U` and `IsConnected U`, for any function `f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ`, assuming `h_harm : harmonic_on U f` (which is vacuous because `harmonic_on` is `True`), and a point `p ∈ U`, and the hypothesis `hmax : ∀ q ∈ U, f q ≤ f p` (i.e., `p` is a global maximizer of `f` on `U`), then `∀ q ∈ U, f q = f p` (i.e., `f` is constant on `U`). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Let `U ⊆ ℝ^2` be connected and open, let `f: U → ℝ` be harmonic (i.e., twice continuously differentiable with `f_xx + f_yy = 0`), and suppose `f` attains a maximum at some `p ∈ U`. Then `f` is constant on `U`.
- The Lean theorem’s structure about `U` (open and connected) and the maximum hypothesis `hmax` faithfully encode that `p` is a maximizer over `U` (since `U` is open, `p ∈ U` means interior). The conclusion “`f` is constant on `U`” is encoded as `∀ q ∈ U, f q = f p`.
- However, the key harmonic assumption is replaced by a placeholder `harmonic_on` defined as `True`. This makes the hypothesis vacuous and the theorem statement strictly stronger than the intended maximum principle: it would assert that any function on any open connected set that attains a maximum at an interior point is constant. Thus the formal statement is not faithful to the intended analytic content.
- Additionally, the proof is `sorry`, which is acceptable if only the statement is being audited, but the core issue remains the vacuous auxiliary definition.

3) Final comparison:
- Same parts: domain/codomain (`ℝ × ℝ` vs `ℝ^2`), `U` open and connected, “attains a maximum at `p ∈ U`,” and conclusion “`f` is constant on `U`.”
- Differences: the harmonicity hypothesis is not faithfully represented (vacuous `True` predicate). Therefore the Lean code does not legitimately encode the original statement; it encodes a stronger, incorrect claim in place of the maximum principle.

Given the rubric, this uses a vacuous auxiliary definition; if that were fixed to a legitimate harmonic predicate, the theorem statement would be faithful. Hence it earns a mid-level score.

- The Lean uses the standard representation ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ` and ℝ^{n+1} as `(Fin n → ℝ) × ℝ`. This is a customary identification and is acceptable.
- The function f is typed as `(Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ` with `ContinuousOn f U`. This is a slight generalization of f : U → ℝ, but entirely standard and equivalent for the purpose of the statement since only values on U are used and continuity is only required on U.
- The set `Set.image (fun x => (x, f x)) U` exactly matches the graph G = { (x, f x) | x ∈ U }.
- `MeasureTheory.isNull volume ...` asserts measure zero with respect to Lebesgue measure on the ambient space, which matches “has measure zero in ℝ^{n+1}”.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement directly encodes the intended theorem.

Final check:
- The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with only harmless technical choices (product space for ℝ^{n+1}, using ContinuousOn on an ambient function instead of a function with domain U). No substantive discrepancy.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]` sets the context: we work in a real normed vector space E (possibly infinite-dimensional). This generalizes the natural statement (which is typically over ℝ) to vector-valued series.
- The theorem statement `summable_of_bounded_partial_sums_and_variation {x : ℕ → E} {λ : ℕ → ℝ}`: x is a sequence in E and λ is a real sequence.
- Hypothesis `h_bounded : ∃ C, ∀ n, ‖∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), x i‖ ≤ C` says the partial sums S_n = x_0 + ... + x_n are uniformly bounded in norm. This matches “series with bounded partial sums,” up to an index shift (Lean starts at 0 rather than 1), which is a harmless reindexing.
- Hypothesis `hλ : Tendsto λ atTop (𝓝 (0 : ℝ))` says λ_n → 0.
- Hypothesis `h_var : Summable fun n => abs (λ (n + 1) - λ n)` says the series ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges (again with index starting at 0; equivalent to starting at 1).
- Conclusion `Summable fun n => λ n • x n` asserts the series ∑ λ_n x_n converges in E (summable).

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The Lean theorem is a direct formalization of: If the partial sums of ∑ x_n are bounded, λ_n → 0, and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges, then ∑ λ_n x_n converges. The only differences are:
  - Indexing starts at 0 in Lean versus 1 in the natural language; this is a benign shift.
  - The Lean statement is slightly more general: x_n takes values in an arbitrary real normed vector space E, not just ℝ. This is a standard and acceptable generalization and preserves the essence of the statement.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib concepts.

Final check:
- The mathematical content matches exactly (up to the standard generalization to vector-valued series and index shift). There are no misleading or vacuous definitions. The conclusion in Lean precisely states the desired convergence (summability).

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

  This says: The sequence of functions f_n converges uniformly to g on compact subsets in the specific sense: for every natural number k and every ε > 0, there exists an index N such that for all n ≥ N and all x in the closed interval [−k, k], we have |f_n(x) − g(x)| < ε. This matches the given natural language definition which defines “uniformly on compact subsets” as uniform convergence on each interval [−k, k] for k ∈ ℕ.
- The theorem `uniform_on_compacts_limit_continuous` states: If each f_n is continuous and f_n → g uniformly on compact subsets (as defined above), then g is continuous on ℝ. This exactly matches the requested statement that the limit is continuous on ℝ under the given hypothesis.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The auxiliary definition is non-vacuous and directly formalizes the given (nonstandard but explicitly stated) definition of uniform convergence on compact subsets via the family of intervals [−k, k].

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Import the Mathlib library.
- `theorem lean_env_test : True := by trivial`: This states and proves a trivial theorem that `True` holds. It has no content related to power series, complex numbers, or zeros of analytic functions.

Step 2: Assess if the whole translation is faithful to the original statement.
The natural language statement concerns a convergent power series over the complex numbers, a sequence of nonzero points tending to 0 at which the function vanishes, and the conclusion that all coefficients are zero. The Lean code contains no definitions or theorems about complex numbers, power series, sequences, or zeros; it only proves `True`. Therefore, it is entirely unrelated to the intended statement.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
They are different. The provided Lean code does not attempt to formalize or prove anything about the given analytic statement. There are no auxiliary definitions (vacuous or otherwise) relevant to the topic; the final theorem is unrelated.

Guidelines check:
- No faithful translation of Mathlib concepts is present.
- No auxiliary definitions are made; the only theorem is vacuous with respect to the problem.
- The final theorem does not match the statement in any way.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: Brings in Mathlib and matrix-related namespaces.
- `variable {R : Type _} [CommRing R]`: We are working over a commutative ring R.
- `variable {n : Type _} [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n]`: The index type n is finite (so matrices are n-by-n) and has decidable equality (needed for determinants).
- `theorem det_adjugate_pow (A : Matrix n n R) : (A.adjugate).det = A.det ^ (Fintype.card n - 1) := by sorry`
  This states: For any square matrix A over R indexed by a finite type n (so size is |n| × |n|), the determinant of the adjugate of A equals det(A) raised to the power |n| − 1.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: If A is an n-by-n matrix and B is the matrix of cofactors of A, show det(B) = det(A)^{n−1}.
- In Mathlib, `Matrix.adjugate A` is the adjugate matrix, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. Since determinant is invariant under transpose, det(adjugate A) = det(cofactor matrix of A). Thus the Lean statement `(A.adjugate).det = A.det ^ (Fintype.card n - 1)` is mathematically equivalent to the requested statement `det(B) = det(A)^{n-1}` with B the cofactor matrix.
- The base ring is a `CommRing R`, which is sufficiently general for determinants and cofactors; this is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- The dimension is expressed as `Fintype.card n` rather than a natural number n, which is Mathlib’s standard way to encode matrix sizes. This is a faithful formalization.

Final check:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; only a single theorem statement, aligned with Mathlib terminology.
- The only difference is using `adjugate` (transpose of cofactor matrix) instead of explicitly naming the cofactor matrix, but since determinant is invariant under transpose, the two statements are equivalent. Hence, the translation is faithful.

  Natural language: Let X be a metric space and K ⊆ X be compact. For every ε > 0, there exists a finite subset s of X, in fact with s ⊆ K, such that K is contained in the union of the open ε-balls centered at the points of s. Equivalently, K can be covered by finitely many open ε-balls with centers in K.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: “Let (X,d) be a metric space. Suppose K ⊆ X is compact. Prove that K is the union of finitely many open balls of radius ε, for every ε > 0.”
- Lean: For every ε > 0, there exists a finite set s ⊆ K with K ⊆ ⋃_{x∈s} B(x, ε). This exactly captures that K can be covered by finitely many open ε-balls. The Lean statement is even slightly stronger by requiring the centers to lie in K, which is a standard refinement and does not conflict with the natural language (which did not specify where centers must lie). The use of ⊆ (coverage) instead of equality is the mathematically correct interpretation of “is the union of finitely many open balls,” since equality would generally fail unless one interprets “union” as “covered by.” This is the conventional formulation.

3) Final check:
- Hypotheses match: metric space, compact K, ε > 0.
- Conclusion matches: finite cover by ε-balls. Slight strengthening (centers in K) is acceptable and standard.

Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  This defines, for ℝ^n represented as `Fin n → ℝ`, the set of points x whose i-th coordinate lies in the closed interval [a_i, b_i] for every coordinate i. This is the standard axis-aligned closed rectangle (box). No requirement that a ≤ b is imposed, so the box could be empty in degenerate cases, but it’s still a “closed rectangle” in the intended sense.

- The theorem `exists_finite_closed_rectangles_cover_disjoint` has parameters `{n : ℕ} {U S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} (hU : Prop) (hS : Prop) (hJ : Prop)` and asserts the existence of:
  ∃ k and a finite family `P : Fin k → Set (Fin n → ℝ)` such that:

  The proof is `by sorry`, so it’s a placeholder, but per the task, we only check the statement, not the proof.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language requires: U is open, S ⊆ U, S is compact and Jordan measurable. The code introduces three hypotheses `(hU : Prop) (hS : Prop) (hJ : Prop)`, but they are arbitrary, unnamed propositions with no specified meaning and are not used anywhere in the statement. Thus the theorem statement effectively claims the conclusion for arbitrary sets U and S without any conditions (since the Props are unused), which is far stronger and generally false.
- The conclusion matches the desired structure: finitely many closed rectangles (boxes) contained in U covering S with pairwise disjoint interiors. Using `P j = box a b` adequately captures “closed rectangle.” The representation of ℝ^n as `Fin n → ℝ` is standard and fine. Using equality to the empty set for disjointness is also fine.
- Missing or incorrect parts: the essential hypotheses (U open, S compact and Jordan measurable) are neither stated nor encoded. The dummy props are vacuous placeholders. Also, the code does not even require S ⊆ U as a hypothesis; instead it would force S ⊆ U through the conclusion, but that depends on existence, which should hinge on the missing hypotheses.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem claims existence of such a finite covering for arbitrary U and S (since `hU`, `hS`, `hJ` are meaningless and unused). The natural language theorem asserts existence under specific conditions: U open and S compact and Jordan measurable subset of U. Hence the Lean statement is not a faithful translation; it omits the crucial hypotheses via vacuous placeholders.

Given these discrepancies, especially the vacuous hypotheses and the mismatch in logical strength, the translation is not faithful. If the props were replaced by the correct Mathlib predicates (e.g., `IsOpen U`, `IsCompact S`, `S ⊆ U`, and a suitable notion of Jordan measurability) and used as hypotheses, the rest of the statement would be aligned, so it’s in the “could be fixed to be faithful” category.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open BigOperators`: bring in Mathlib and notation for sums/products.
- `variable {a b : ℕ → ℝ}`: Fix two real sequences (indexed by natural numbers) a and b.
- `def c (n : ℕ) : ℝ := ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), a k * b (n - k)`: Define the nth term c(n) as the finite convolution sum from k = 0 to n of a_k * b_{n-k}. Here `Finset.range (n+1)` is {0, 1, ..., n}, so this matches exactly c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}. The subtraction `n - k` is well-defined since k ≤ n on this range.
- `theorem abs_summable_convolution (ha : Summable fun n => |a n|) (hb : Summable fun n => |b n|) : Summable fun n => |c n| ∧ (∑' n, c n) = (∑' n, a n) * (∑' n, b n) := by sorry`: If the series of absolute values of a and b are summable (absolute convergence of ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n), then the series of absolute values of c is summable (absolute convergence of ∑ c_n) and the infinite sum of c equals the product of the sums of a and b. The `tsum` notation `∑'` denotes the infinite sum.

2) Whole translation assessment:
The natural language statement asserts: given absolutely convergent series ∑ a_n and ∑ b_n, define c_n = ∑_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}; then ∑ c_n converges absolutely and equals (∑ a_n)(∑ b_n). The Lean code assumes absolute summability of a and b via `Summable fun n => |a n|`, defines c_n as the Cauchy product coefficients, and concludes absolute summability of c together with the product formula for the sums. This matches exactly.

3) Final check of differences:
- Domain: Lean works over ℝ; the natural statement does not specify a field, but ℝ is a standard and acceptable specialization. This is a harmless specialization and faithful to the intended result.
- Indexing: The definition uses `Finset.range (n+1)` so the sum runs from 0 to n inclusive, exactly as in the statement.
- No vacuous placeholders: `c` is a genuine definition; the theorem uses standard Mathlib notions `Summable` and `tsum`. There are no fake auxiliary definitions.
Thus the formal statement faithfully captures the natural language proposition.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean 4 code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable {R : Type _} [Field R]`: Work over a field R.
- `variable {n : Nat}`: Fix a natural number n, the matrix size.
- `def S : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R := fun i j => if (i.val + j.val) % 2 = 0 then (1 : R) else (-1 : R)`: Define the n-by-n matrix S with entries S_{i,j} = 1 if i+j is even and -1 if i+j is odd, using 0-based indices (Fin n). This corresponds to S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j} regardless of 0- or 1-based indexing because shifting both indices by 1 changes the sum by 2 and does not change the parity.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- The natural language statement requires: (a) define A an n-by-n matrix and B its cofactor matrix, (b) show that A S A^T is diagonal, and (c) if A is invertible, show (A^T)^{-1} = (1/det A) B. Possibly using Laplace formula.
- The Lean code only defines the sign matrix S and does not define A, B, the cofactor matrix, or state/prove any of the required results about ASA^T or the inverse of A^T.
- So only a small preliminary piece (the definition of S) is present; the main statements are entirely missing.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Different. The code provides only the definition of S (which matches S_{i,j} = (-1)^{i+j}). It does not address the diagonal nature of ASA^T, does not define the cofactor matrix B, and does not prove the inverse formula. There are no placeholder or vacuous definitions; the provided piece is correct but drastically incomplete relative to the full statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the original statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib.
- Docstring restates the natural language statement informally.
- `theorem power_series_derivative (a : ℝ) (c : ℕ → ℝ) (ρ : ℝ) (hρ : 0 < ρ) : ∀ x : ℝ, HasDerivAt (fun y => ∑' n, c n * (y - a) ^ n) (∑' n, (n + 1) * c (n + 1) * (x - a) ^ n) x := by sorry`
  Natural language translation: For any real numbers `a`, any coefficient sequence `c : ℕ → ℝ`, and any positive real `ρ`, for all real `x`, the function `y ↦ ∑' n, c n * (y - a)^n` has derivative at `x` equal to `∑' n, (n+1) * c (n+1) * (x - a)^n`.

Step 2: Compare to the original statement.
Original statement: Given a power series ∑ c_n (x−a)^n with radius of convergence 0 < ρ ≤ ∞, define f on the interval I (presumably the open interval of convergence). Then f is differentiable on I and f'(x) = ∑ (n+1)c_{n+1}(x−a)^n for x ∈ I. Moreover, the derived series has the same radius of convergence ρ.

Discrepancies:
- Domain/conditions: The Lean statement asserts differentiability for all x : ℝ, with no restriction to the interval of convergence I. It does not encode any radius-of-convergence or summability condition. In contrast, the natural language requires x in the interval I inside the radius of convergence.
- Use of ρ: The Lean theorem takes a parameter ρ with hρ : 0 < ρ, but never uses it in the conclusion. There is no connection to the radius of convergence, nor any mention of I. The original statement hinges on the radius ρ and the domain I.
- Radius equality: The original statement asserts the radius of convergence of the derived series equals ρ. The Lean theorem has no statement about radius of convergence at all.
- Extended range for ρ: The original says 0 < ρ ≤ ∞ (in extended nonnegative reals). The Lean code treats ρ as a real number and ignores the ∞ case.
- Definition of f: In the original, f is the sum on I. In Lean, the function is `y ↦ tsum (c n * (y-a)^n)` defined for all y. Outside the radius, `tsum` does not represent the series sum (and can default to 0 if not summable), so this function is not the intended f outside I.

Step 3: Final check.
The Lean statement is not a faithful formalization. It overclaims differentiability at all real x with no hypotheses, omits the interval I and the radius-of-convergence equality, and does not connect ρ to anything. Therefore the two problems are different.

- The natural language statement concerns bounded linear operators between normed vector spaces, invertibility, the operator norm, and an explicit bound on the inverse using the Neumann series. The Lean code does not mention normed spaces, linear maps, operator norms, invertibility, or any related structure. It only states a trivial identity in Nat.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem `differentiable_at_of_deriv_tendsto` is stated for real numbers `a b c L : ℝ` and a function `f : ℝ → ℝ`.
- Hypothesis `hpos : a < c ∧ c < b` means c lies in the open interval (a, b).
- Hypothesis `hcont : ContinuousOn f (Set.Ioo a b)` says f is continuous on the open interval (a, b).
- Hypothesis `hdiff : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Set.Ioo a b \ {c})` says f is differentiable at every point of (a, b) except possibly at c.
- Hypothesis `hderiv_lim : Tendsto (fun x => derivWithin f (Set.Ioo a b \ {c}) x) (nhdsWithin c (Set.Ioo a b \ {c})) (nhds L)` asserts that as x approaches c within the punctured set (a, b) \ {c}, the derivative within that set tends to L. Since (a, b) \ {c} is open and f is differentiable there, `derivWithin f (Set.Ioo a b \ {c}) x = deriv f x` for x ≠ c, so this encodes the usual statement that lim_{x→c} f'(x) = L along (a, b) with x ≠ c.
- Conclusion: `DifferentiableAt ℝ f c ∧ deriv f c = L` states f is differentiable at c with derivative L.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: f : (a, b) → ℝ is continuous on (a, b) and differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}; c ∈ (a, b); lim_{x→c} f'(x) = L exists. Conclude f is differentiable at c with f'(c) = L.
- Lean formalization: f is defined on ℝ but only required to be continuous on (a, b) and differentiable on (a, b) \ {c}. This is a standard and harmless generalization. The limit of f' is encoded via `derivWithin` and `nhdsWithin` to properly model the punctured limit along the domain, which matches the intended meaning since f' is only defined on (a, b) \ {c}.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions are standard Mathlib ones.

Final check: The mathematical content matches exactly. The slight generalization of having f defined on ℝ rather than only on (a, b) is acceptable and faithful. The use of `derivWithin` on the punctured open set precisely captures the limit of f' as x → c, x ≠ c.

- `variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → Set ℝ → Prop)` declares an arbitrary predicate that one may intend to mean ""Riemann integrable on a set"" but it is not tied to Mathlib.
- `variable (riemannIntegral : (ℝ → ℝ) → Set ℝ → ℝ)` declares an arbitrary function intended to represent the Riemann integral over a set, again not tied to Mathlib.
- `variable (UniformLimitOnSeq : (ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) → (ℝ → ℝ) → Set ℝ → Prop)` declares an arbitrary predicate intended to mean uniform convergence on a set, but again it is an uninterpreted symbol.

The theorem statement:
- Hypotheses:
  - `(h_int : ∀ n, RiemannIntegrableOn (f_seq n) (Set.Icc a b))`: for each n, f_seq n is (supposedly) Riemann integrable on [a,b].
  - `(h_unif : UniformLimitOnSeq f_seq f (Set.Icc a b))`: f_seq converges uniformly to f on [a,b].
- Conclusion:
  - `RiemannIntegrableOn f (Set.Icc a b)`: f is (supposedly) Riemann integrable on [a,b].
  - And the integrals converge: `∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |riemannIntegral (f_seq n) (Set.Icc a b) - riemannIntegral f (Set.Icc a b)| < ε`.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The overall shape matches the natural statement: integrability of each f_n on [a,b] plus uniform convergence on [a,b] implies integrability of f and convergence of integrals to the integral of f.
- However, the code introduces crucial concepts (RiemannIntegrableOn, riemannIntegral, UniformLimitOnSeq) as arbitrary variables, not Mathlib-defined notions. This makes the statement schematic and not a faithful formalization of Riemann integrability or uniform convergence in Mathlib. It does not use Mathlib’s actual definitions (e.g., uniform convergence via UniformFun/TendstoUniformlyOn, nor any real Riemann integral definition).
- This falls under the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and faithful. Here they are not even definitions; they are uninterpreted symbols, so the theorem is about an arbitrary predicate and functions with matching names, not about the actual mathematical concepts.
- There is also a minor technical omission: no assumption `a ≤ b`. While the natural-language statement implicitly assumes [a,b] is a proper closed interval, this mismatch is relatively small compared to the main issue.
- The proof is `by sorry`, but per instructions the proof is not the focus; rather, the statement and definitions are. Still, the reliance on placeholder predicates makes the formal statement unfaithful.

Final comparison:
- Natural language: about genuine Riemann integrability on [a,b] and uniform convergence, concluding integrability of the limit and convergence of integrals.
- Lean code: about arbitrary, uninterpreted predicates/functions named as if they were those concepts. Hence, not a legitimate, faithful translation.

Therefore, the translation fails.

- The Lean code assumes: U open, f differentiable on U, and f convex on U, and concludes exactly the convexity inequality for all x, y ∈ U and t ∈ [0, 1].
- The only formalization detail is that Lean takes f : E → ℝ (defined on all E) with DifferentiableOn U, instead of f : U → ℝ, which is standard in Mathlib. The space E is a general finite-dimensional real normed space, i.e., ℝ^n up to isomorphism. This is a benign generalization.

- In standard usage, an ε-net for K is a finite set of centers whose ε-balls cover K. The Lean statement exactly asserts existence of a finite set S with K ⊆ ⋃_{x∈S} ball(x, ε).
- The code quantifies over all ε > 0 and produces a finite set S, i.e., a finite ε-net.
- Minor nuance: Some texts require the ε-net to be a subset of K. The code allows centers anywhere in X (S : Finset X), which is a harmless slight generalization and standard in total boundedness/compactness characterizations. The coverage condition is precisely what matters for an ε-net.
- Open vs closed balls: The code uses open balls; this matches typical definitions and is equivalent for this compactness covering statement.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly formalizes the claim.

Final check:

- Using `f : ℝ → ℝ` together with `nhdsWithin c S` is a standard formalization of “f is defined on S and we consider the limit as x → c with x ∈ S.” It is a slight generalization (f is defined on all ℝ), but it is equivalent for the within-S limit and faithful to the intended meaning.
- The natural language also mentions g and its limit M, but g is irrelevant to the conclusion. Omitting it in the formal statement is fine.
- The natural language states c is a cluster point of S to avoid trivialities; the formal statement assumes directly that `Tendsto f (nhdsWithin c S) (nhds L)` holds, which implicitly covers the meaningful case. This does not change the mathematical content of the implication being formalized.
- There are no auxiliary vacuous definitions; only a theorem statement with the expected hypothesis and conclusion. The proof is left as `sorry`, which is acceptable for auditing the statement translation.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. Both state: given the (within S) limit of f at c equals L, the (within S) limit of a f at c equals a L. The extra data about g and the cluster point condition do not affect the correctness of the stated limit law, and the Lean statement precisely matches the needed implication using filters within S.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib's library.
- `theorem monotone_or_antitone_seq_const_from_index (x : ℕ → ℝ) (k : ℕ)`: Let x be a sequence of real numbers indexed by natural numbers, and fix an index k ∈ ℕ.
- `(hmono : Monotone x ∨ Antitone x)`: Assume the sequence is either monotone nondecreasing (Monotone) or monotone nonincreasing (Antitone).
- `(hconv : Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 (x k)))`: Assume the sequence converges (as n → ∞) to the value x k.
- `: ∀ n, n ≥ k → x n = x k := by sorry`: Conclude that for every n with n ≥ k, we have x n = x k (i.e., the sequence is constant from index k onward).

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
Natural statement: We have a convergent monotone sequence {x_n}. Suppose there exists k ∈ ℕ such that lim x_n = x_k. Show that x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k.
- Monotonicity: The Lean hypothesis `Monotone x ∨ Antitone x` matches the typical meaning of “monotone” (either nondecreasing or nonincreasing). This is an acceptable and faithful interpretation.
- Convergence and limit equals x_k: The Lean hypothesis `Tendsto x atTop (𝓝 (x k))` directly encodes that the sequence converges and that its limit equals x_k for the given k. This corresponds precisely to “there exists k with lim x_n = x_k” by taking that k and asserting the convergence to x_k.
- Conclusion: The Lean conclusion `∀ n, n ≥ k → x n = x k` exactly matches “x_n = x_k for all n ≥ k”.
- Indexing: The natural statement indexes from 1 while Lean uses ℕ (typically starting at 0). The claim is formulated for all n ≥ k, so this discrepancy is harmless.
- Domain: The Lean code fixes ℝ, which is the standard setting for monotone sequences and convergence; the natural statement did not specify a broader space. This is a reasonable specialization.

3) Final check:
The formal statement is a faithful translation: it assumes monotonicity, assumes convergence to x_k for a particular k (matching the existence of such a k), and concludes the sequence is constant from k onward. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib notions. Any slight differences (indexing start, allowing either monotone direction) are acceptable and do not change the mathematical meaning.

  Natural language: For a normed field k and normed k-vector spaces X, Y, given a continuous linear map A: X → Y that is bijective, we define (noncomputably) a continuous linear map from Y to X. The body is filled with `sorry` (i.e., a placeholder, no construction/proof provided).

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The natural statement: If A ∈ L(X,Y) (bounded/continuous linear operator) is injective and surjective, then the inverse A^{-1}: Y → X is bounded (continuous). Typically one uses the Open Mapping Theorem; otherwise one assumes completeness (Banach spaces) to justify the result.
- Issues in the Lean code:
  - Missing completeness assumptions: The bounded inverse theorem generally requires completeness (Banach). The code has no `[CompleteSpace X]` or `[CompleteSpace Y]`, so it asserts a stronger (and in general false) statement.
  - The returned object is just some `Y →L[k] X`. There is no assertion that this map is actually the inverse of A (no equations `A ∘ B = id` and `B ∘ A = id`, nor a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`). Thus even if a term were provided, the statement does not guarantee it is A^{-1}.
  - The definition uses `by sorry`, which is a vacuous placeholder and disallowed by the guidelines. There is no legitimate construction provided.

3) Final comparison:
- The math problems are different. The original asks to prove that the inverse of a bijective bounded linear operator is bounded, typically under completeness assumptions. The Lean code (a) lacks the completeness hypothesis, (b) does not specify the returned map is the inverse, and (c) uses a `sorry` placeholder. Therefore, it is not a faithful formalization.

Given these discrepancies, especially the missing inverse property and the vacuous `sorry`, the translation fails.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is: For X ⊆ ℝ^n and the standard outer measure m* on ℝ^n, if for every ε>0 there exists Y ⊇ X with m*(Y) ≤ ε, then m*(X) = 0.
- The Lean statement is a slight generalization: it holds for any type α and any set function m* that is nonnegative and monotone. This is a standard, legitimate generalization; the argument only uses monotonicity and nonnegativity, which an outer measure satisfies. The hypothesis `h` exactly matches the quantifiers and inequalities from the natural language.
- There are no vacuous or fake definitions; mstar is a parameter, and the structural properties (nonnegative, monotone) are recorded as variables in scope. The theorem cleanly states the desired implication with no artificial placeholders.

3) Final check for differences:
- Difference: α is general instead of ℝ^n, and m* is an abstract nonnegative monotone set function rather than explicitly the Lebesgue outer measure. This is an acceptable and faithful generalization, not a weakening or an unrelated change.
- No other discrepancies. The quantified condition and the conclusion m*(X)=0 are identical in meaning.

- `variable {U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} {F : (Fin n → ℝ) → (Fin n → ℝ)}`: U is a subset of ℝ^n and F is a function ℝ^n → ℝ^n.
- Hypotheses:
  - `U_convex : Convex ℝ U`: U is convex.
  - `h_has : ∀ x ∈ U, HasFDerivAt F (fderiv ℝ F x) x`: for every x in U, F is Fréchet differentiable at x with derivative `fderiv ℝ F x`.
  - `h_cont : ContinuousOn (fun x => fderiv ℝ F x) U`: the derivative map x ↦ DF(x) is continuous on U.
- Conclusion:
  - For every compact K ⊆ U, and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K and all h with ‖h‖ < δ and with x + h ∈ U, we have
    ‖F(x + h) − F(x) − DF(x)(h)‖ ≤ ε ‖h‖.
  This expresses a uniform little-o estimate on K as h → 0, uniformly in x ∈ K.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language asks: given F: ℝ^n → ℝ^n, with DF existing and continuous on a convex set U, prove that ‖F(x+h) − F(x) − DF(x)h‖ = o(‖h‖) uniformly on compact subsets of U as h → 0.
- The Lean hypotheses match: U is convex; F is differentiable at each x ∈ U (HasFDerivAt), and the derivative is continuous on U (ContinuousOn of fderiv). This is exactly “DF exists and is continuous on U”.
- The conclusion matches the uniform little-o on compact subsets: for each compact K ⊆ U and ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 (independent of x ∈ K) controlling the remainder by ε‖h‖ for ‖h‖ < δ. This is the standard ε–δ formulation of a uniform o(‖h‖) estimate.
- The extra condition `x + h ∈ U` ensures the increment remains in the domain where DF’s continuity is assumed; this is a common technical guard. Since K ⊆ U and K is compact, one can choose δ ≤ dist(K, Uᶜ) to make the guard automatic; including it does not change the intended meaning.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Domain: Lean uses `(Fin n → ℝ)` for ℝ^n; standard in Mathlib and equivalent for this statement.
- Uniformity: correctly captured with a δ independent of x ∈ K.
- Inequality uses ≤ instead of <; standard and equivalent for little-o.
- The guard `x + h ∈ U` is a mild technicality, consistent with the setting where hypotheses on DF are restricted to U; it does not alter the core statement.
- The Lean code does not assume global differentiability of F outside U, which is a harmless generalization since the claim only concerns compact subsets of U.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

Natural language: For any set R in ℝ^n and function f: ℝ^n → ℝ, assuming two placeholder hypotheses (hR_closed and hR_rect) that are merely Props (not linked to R being a closed rectangle), that f is Riemann integrable on R according to an abstract predicate, that f ≥ 0 on R, and that the abstract integral of f on R equals 0, then there exists a set E in ℝ^n with abstract “outer measure zero” such that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R \ E. The proof is omitted via sorry.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The intended mathematical statement is: If R is a closed rectangle in ℝ^n and f: R → ℝ is Riemann integrable, nonnegative, and has integral 0 over R, then there exists E ⊆ R of Lebesgue outer measure 0 such that f = 0 on R \ E.
- The Lean code introduces completely abstract placeholders for integrability, integral, and outer measure zero. These are vacuous; they are not tied to Mathlib’s Riemann integral or Lebesgue outer measure, and have no properties ensured.
- The conditions “R is a closed rectangle” are represented only as arbitrary Props hR_closed, hR_rect, not linked to R at all. They are placeholders and could be True or False with no effect on the statement.
- The conclusion does not require E ⊆ R, only a set E in the ambient space. While one could take E ∩ R to fix this if outer measure zero is the intended Lebesgue outer measure (since it is hereditary), the code’s outer_measure_zero is an uninterpreted predicate, so this fix is not guaranteed in the formal statement.
- The statement uses sorry for the proof, which is allowed for compiling but not relevant; the key issue is the vacuous definitions/assumptions.

3) Final comparison:
- The code restates a shape of the theorem but with key notions replaced by abstract constants (vacuous placeholders). This fails the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and faithful.
- There is also a minor mismatch: the code does not require E ⊆ R, though this is a small issue compared to the vacuity of the core notions.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful because it relies on vacuous placeholders for the central mathematical concepts and even the “closed rectangle” condition. If those placeholders were replaced by the actual Mathlib notions (Riemann integrable on a closed rectangle and Lebesgue outer measure zero), the final statement would essentially match the natural language statement, aside from the minor E ⊆ R detail that could be fixed by intersecting with R. Hence, it deserves a mid score for being a shape-correct restatement but not a faithful formalization.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:

- The theorem `convolution_well_defined` has parameters `{f g : ℝ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ}`.
  Hypotheses:
  • `hf : Integrable f volume` means f is Lebesgue integrable on ℝ (i.e., ∫ |f| dμ < ∞ and f is measurable).
  • `hg_cont : Continuous g` means g is continuous on ℝ.
  • `hg_support : ∀ t, t ∉ Icc a b → g t = 0` means g(t) = 0 whenever t is outside the closed interval [a, b].
  Conclusion:
  • `∀ x : ℝ, Integrable (fun t => f t * g (x - t)) volume` means for every real x, the function t ↦ f(t)·g(x − t) is Lebesgue integrable on ℝ. This captures that the convolution integral is well-defined for each x.
  The proof is omitted with `sorry`; we only audit the statement.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Original: f is a Riemann integrable function with ∫_{−∞}^{∞} |f(x)| dx < ∞ (absolute integrability). g is continuous and equals zero outside [a, b]. Show that the convolution (g * f)(x) = ∫ f(t) g(x − t) dt is well-defined for all x ∈ ℝ.
- Lean: Assumes f is Lebesgue integrable (Integrable f), g is continuous, and g is zero outside [a, b]. Concludes that for all x, t ↦ f(t) g(x − t) is integrable (so the convolution integral exists and is finite).
- This is a standard and faithful formalization: using Lebesgue integrability instead of “Riemann integrable with ∫ |f| < ∞” is a slight generalization and is customary in formal proofs. The support condition is stated precisely via g vanishing outside Icc a b. The conclusion exactly captures well-definedness of the convolution via integrability of the integrand for each x.

3) Final check for differences:
- The only difference is the framework: Lebesgue integrable (Lean) vs Riemann integrable with absolutely convergent improper integral (natural language). The assumption in Lean is at least as strong in the sense needed for the conclusion and is a standard generalization; the mathematical content remains the same regarding well-definedness.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions; no red flags. The theorem statement is aligned with the original problem.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization (indeed, a benign generalization) of the natural language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Matrix`: bring in Mathlib and Matrix namespace.
- Universe and variables: `R` is a commutative ring, `n` is a finite type with decidable equality. Matrices are of type `Matrix n n R`, i.e., n-by-n matrices over `R` indexed by a finite type `n`. This matches the natural language's “n-by-n matrix”. Working over a commutative ring is a standard generality for determinants.

Theorems:
1) `theorem det_swap_cols (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : det (A.reindex (Equiv.refl n) (Equiv.swap j k)) = - det A`.
   - Natural language: The matrix on the LHS is obtained from `A` by applying `Equiv.swap j k` to the column indices (and identity on rows), i.e., swapping columns `j` and `k`. The statement claims that the determinant becomes the negative of the original determinant.
   - Issue: There is no hypothesis `j ≠ k`. In Lean, `Equiv.swap j k` is the identity if `j = k`, so the LHS equals `det A` in that case. The statement would then assert `det A = - det A` for all `A`, which is false in general. The correct formulation requires `j ≠ k`.

2) `theorem det_swap_rows (A : Matrix n n R) (j k : n) : det (A.reindex (Equiv.swap j k) (Equiv.refl n)) = - det A`.
   - Natural language: The matrix on the LHS is obtained from `A` by swapping rows `j` and `k`. The statement claims the determinant changes sign.
   - Issue: Again missing the necessary hypothesis `j ≠ k`. If `j = k`, the reindexing is the identity, so the conclusion is false.

   - Natural language: If two distinct rows `i` and `j` are equal entrywise, then the determinant is zero. This matches the statement “if a matrix has two equal rows then det(A) = 0”. The explicit `i ≠ j` is appropriate and faithful.

4) `theorem det_eq_zero_of_col_eq (A : Matrix n n R) {i j : n} (h : i ≠ j) (heq : ∀ k, A k i = A k j) : det A = 0`.
   - Natural language: If two distinct columns `i` and `j` are equal entrywise, then the determinant is zero. This matches the statement “if a matrix has two equal columns then det(A) = 0”. The explicit `i ≠ j` is appropriate and faithful.

Whole translation assessment:
- The indexing framework and ring generality are appropriate and faithful to the usual context.
- The constructions of the swapped-row/column matrices via `reindex` and `Equiv.swap` are correct representations of “switching” rows/columns.
- However, the first two theorems omit the essential hypothesis that the two indices are distinct. The natural language implicitly assumes a true swap (j ≠ k). Without this, the Lean statements are false when `j = k`. This is a substantive mismatch.
- The last two theorems about equal rows/columns implying zero determinant are faithful and correctly formulated.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- They differ in the first two statements: the Lean code asserts sign change even when j = k, which is not what the natural-language “switching” means and is false. The rest matches. Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The environment: E is a real finite-dimensional normed vector space (a generalization of R^n). U is a subset of E, f : E → ℝ. H : E → E → E → ℝ is an arbitrary function taking x, h, h' to a real number.
- hf : DifferentiableOn ℝ f U means f is (Fréchet) differentiable at every point of U.
- H_cont : ContinuousOn (fun x => H x) U asserts that the map x ↦ (h ↦ (h' ↦ H x h h')) is continuous on U (with the product/Pi topology on the function space). There is no assumption that H x is bilinear or that it is related to f (e.g., as the Hessian/second derivative of f).
- conv : Convex ℝ U assumes U is convex.
- The theorem statement: For every compact K with K ⊆ U, and for every x ∈ K, the function of h given by f (x + h) - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) h - (1/2) * H x h h is little-o of ‖h‖^2 as h → 0 (filter 𝓝 0).

Assessment vs the natural language statement:
- Natural language: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ, with the Hessian H_f continuous on a convex set U, show the second-order Taylor expansion with remainder o(‖h‖^2) as h → 0, uniformly on compact subsets of U. The expansion uses ∇f(x)·h and (1/2) hᵀ H_f(x) h, i.e., the first derivative and the Hessian (second derivative at x), and the uniformity is with respect to x over any compact K ⊆ U.

Key discrepancies:
1) Missing linkage to the Hessian: The code introduces an arbitrary H : E → E → E → ℝ with continuity in x but no assumption that H is bilinear/symmetric or, crucially, that H equals the second derivative (Hessian) of f. The intended statement requires H = H_f (the actual Hessian), i.e., f should be twice differentiable and H should be its second derivative, continuous on U. This is a major deviation.
2) Uniformity on compact sets is not encoded: The code concludes ∀ x ∈ K, IsLittleO(...) as h → 0. That is a pointwise (in x) little-o property, allowing the smallness scale to depend on x. The original statement requires uniformity over x ∈ K (one δ working for all x in K), i.e., a uniform little-o on compact subsets. The current quantifiers do not enforce uniformity.
3) Differentiability assumptions are too weak: The code assumes only DifferentiableOn f U (first derivative exists). The natural statement requires existence and continuity of the Hessian on U (effectively f ∈ C^2 on U). Without tying H to f’s second derivative, the assumptions are insufficient and mismatched.
4) Generalization to E ≃ ℝ^n is acceptable: Using a finite-dimensional real normed space E instead of ℝ^n is a harmless and standard generalization.
5) Convexity is assumed but not used in the conclusion: While the natural statement includes convexity of U, the code does not actually use it to express the uniformity or any path/segment argument. This doesn’t by itself invalidate the statement, but it highlights that the core uniformity feature is missing.

Final comparison:
- The Lean statement is not the same as the natural language theorem. It asserts a pointwise little-o expansion for every x (given any continuous-in-x H), rather than a uniform-on-compacts expansion with H equal to the Hessian of f. The crucial mathematical content (Hessian of f, uniformity on compacts, C^2 regularity) is not faithfully captured.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

  States the theorem: for square matrices A and B indexed by n over R, det(AB) = det(A) * det(B). The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable per the instructions since we are auditing the statement’s faithfulness.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language asks to prove multiplicativity of determinant for square matrices A and B: det(AB) = det(A) det(B). The Lean statement exactly asserts this equality for matrices `Matrix n n R`, i.e., square matrices over a commutative ring R. This is the standard setting for determinants in Mathlib. The hint about elementary matrices is irrelevant to the statement and need not be encoded.

3) Comparison and potential discrepancies:
- The Lean code requires R to be a commutative ring, which is the standard context where `Matrix.det` is defined. The natural statement does not specify the coefficient ring, but implicitly assumes determinants are defined. Thus, the Lean statement is an appropriate and faithful formalization (if anything, it is the standard generality). There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions. The theorem statement matches the mathematical content precisely.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- The file imports Mathlib.
- The docstring states the intended mathematical statement (about a nonconstant complex polynomial or power series converging on the open ball centered at z0 of radius ε with p z0 ≠ 0 implies the existence of w in that ball with |p w| < |p z0|).
- The theorem `exists_strict_smaller_value_in_ball` is stated with parameters:
  - `ε : ℝ`, `z0 : ℂ`, `p : ℂ → ℂ`.
  - Hypothesis `hε : 0 < ε` corresponds to ε > 0.
  - Hypothesis `hp_nonconst : ∃ z : ℂ, p z ≠ p z0` states that there is some point whose image differs from p z0 (this is equivalent to p being nonconstant since it gives two points, z and z0, with different images).
  - Hypothesis `hp_is_poly_or_power_series : Prop` is just an arbitrary proposition parameter; it does not assert anything and is unused.
  - Hypothesis `hpz0 : p z0 ≠ 0` corresponds to p(z0) ≠ 0.
- The conclusion is `∃ w : ℂ, Complex.abs (w - z0) < ε ∧ Complex.abs (p w) < Complex.abs (p z0)`, i.e., there exists w with |w − z0| < ε and |p w| < |p z0|. This matches the target form of the conclusion.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The natural language requires p to be either a nonconstant complex polynomial, or more generally a nonconstant power series converging in the specified open ball. The Lean code does not enforce any analytic structure: p is an arbitrary function ℂ → ℂ. The placeholder `hp_is_poly_or_power_series : Prop` is vacuous (just a parameter of type Prop), is not assumed true, and is not used anywhere in the theorem; it does not encode that p is a polynomial or a convergent power series on the ball.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is far more general than the intended mathematical statement, and in fact it is false in general for arbitrary functions. This is a major mismatch.
- The nonconstancy hypothesis `hp_nonconst` is acceptable as a formulation of “p is nonconstant” (since it directly gives two points z and z0 with different values), so that part is fine.
- The condition “power series converging in {z : |z − z0| < ε}” is completely missing. The code makes no restriction tying analyticity or convergence to the ball.
- No other auxiliary definitions are introduced, but the presence of `hp_is_poly_or_power_series : Prop` is a red-flag placeholder: a vacuous, unused parameter that does not formalize the intended content.

Final check:
- The math problems are different: the Lean theorem asserts the existence of such a w for any nonconstant function p with p z0 ≠ 0, whereas the natural statement restricts to analytic p (polynomial or convergent power series) on the ball. Hence the Lean code is not a faithful formalization.

Grade rationale:
- There is a vacuous placeholder for the core analytic hypothesis, and the theorem is stated in a much more general (and incorrect) setting. However, if the placeholder were replaced by a faithful predicate expressing “p is a polynomial or a power series converging on the ball,” and it were actually assumed, the resulting theorem statement would align with the natural language statement. Therefore, this fits the rubric for a 6: makes up vacuous definitions but, if fixed, the final theorem/definition would be faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- Context: `E` is a type with a normed additive commutative group structure (`NormedAddCommGroup E`) and a scalar multiplication by real numbers (`[SMul ℝ E]`). This lets us talk about series in `E` and scalar multiplication by reals.
- Sequences: `x : ℕ → E` and `a : ℕ → ℝ` correspond to `(x_n)` and `(λ_n)` in the statement.
- `hBound : ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ N, ‖∑ i in Finset.range (N+1), x i‖ ≤ M` means the partial sums of the series ∑ x_n are bounded in norm: for all N, the partial sum from i = 0 to N has norm ≤ M. This is exactly “the sequence of partial sums is bounded,” up to the index starting at 0 instead of 1 (an immaterial shift).
- `h_lim : Tendsto a atTop (𝓝 0)` means `a_n → 0` as `n → ∞`.
- `hvar : Summable (fun n => |a (n+1) - a n|)` means ∑ |a_{n+1} − a_n| converges; i.e., the total variation of `a` is summable.
- Conclusion: `Summable (fun n => a n • x n)` means the series ∑ a_n • x_n converges in `E` (with • denoting scalar multiplication by reals).

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assertion: If the partial sums of ∑ x_n are bounded, λ_n → 0, and ∑ |λ_{n+1} − λ_n| converges, then ∑ λ_n x_n converges. This is the Dirichlet/Abel test with bounded variation.
- The Lean theorem states precisely that, with the mild generalization that the x_n take values in a real normed additive group with an ℝ-action (so vector-valued series), rather than necessarily ℝ. This is a standard harmless generalization and faithful to the original statement.
- Indexing: Lean sums from 0 to N, while the natural language uses n = 1 to ∞. This shift is insignificant for boundedness of partial sums and convergence conclusions.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced. All terms are standard Mathlib notions (Summable, Tendsto, norm, Finset.range sums).

Final check: The mathematical content matches exactly, up to the benign generalization to `E`-valued series and an index shift. There are no discrepancies that alter the meaning.

- `theorem C_b_is_metric_space : Prop := by sorry`: Declares a theorem whose statement is merely `Prop` (an arbitrary proposition), with a placeholder proof `sorry`. Despite the docstring saying it's the statement that (C_b(X, ℝ), d) is a metric space, the formal statement does not encode this at all; it is completely unspecified.
- `theorem sup_dist_tends_iff_uniform : Prop := by sorry`: Similarly, declares a theorem as an arbitrary proposition with `sorry`. The docstring claims it states the equivalence between convergence in the sup metric and uniform convergence, but the formal statement does not encode any such content.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The only faithful part is the definition of C_b: it correctly captures bounded continuous real-valued functions.
- The core mathematical content of the natural language statement requires:
  1) A definition of the metric d(f,g) = sup_x |f(x) - g(x)| on C_b, and a proof that this is indeed a metric on C_b.
  2) A theorem that convergence in this metric is equivalent to uniform convergence.
- The code does not define the metric, does not provide a metric structure on C_b, and the two theorems are stated as the bare type `Prop` with `sorry`. Thus they are vacuous placeholders and do not even formally state the intended results.

Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean code fails to state the key claims: there is no metric defined, no metric space instance/existence, and no formal equivalence with uniform convergence. The theorems are completely unspecified (`Prop`). Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Discrepancies:
- Missing definition of the sup metric on C_b.
- Missing (or even mis-stated) theorem declarations: they are just `Prop` rather than precise statements.
- Use of `sorry` to fill proofs (allowed during development) but here combined with vacuous statements makes the translation invalid per the guidelines.

These are declared but never used.
- `noncomputable def mstar (S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) : ENNReal := (0 : ENNReal)`: Defines `mstar` to be the constant 0 function on all sets. This is explicitly a placeholder and does not encode the infimum over coverings by open rectangles.

Assessment against the natural language statement:
- The natural statement defines two outer measures on ℝ^n using infimums of sums of volumes over coverings by open rectangles, with the only difference being that in `μ*` the index set is required to be finite or countable. It then asserts `μ*(S) = m*(S)` for every `S`.
- The Lean code does not implement these definitions. Both `mstar` and `mustar` are defined as 0 for all sets, which is vacuous and not faithful to the intended outer measures. The auxiliary declarations `V` and `is_open_rectangle` suggest the intended direction but are unused.
- The final theorem statement `mustar S = mstar S` matches the form of the desired conclusion, but with the vacuous definitions it does not reflect the actual content of the problem. Moreover, the proof is omitted, which is acceptable per instructions, but the core issue is the placeholder definitions.

Final check:
- The mathematical problems are not the same. The Lean code equates two constant-zero functions, whereas the original statement concerns equality of two genuinely defined outer measures via coverings by open rectangles and infimums over sums, with a subtle difference on allowable index sets. The placeholders make the translation unfaithful.
- If the placeholder definitions were replaced by faithful definitions using coverings by open rectangles and the specified index sets, the theorem statement would match the natural language. Hence, it fits the rubric case of vacuous definitions but otherwise the endpoint theorem is the correct one.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- We work in R^n modeled as (Fin n → ℝ), with a set U ⊆ R^n and a function f : R^n → ℝ.
- Hypothesis h : ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f U means f is C^1 (Fréchet differentiable with continuous derivative) on the set U.
- Hypothesis hU : Convex ℝ U means U is convex.
- M : ℝ is a bound.
- Hypothesis hM : ∀ x ∈ U, ‖(fderiv ℝ f x)‖ ≤ M means the operator norm of the derivative at each x in U is bounded by M.
- Conclusion: For all x, y ∈ U, |f y - f x - (fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x)| ≤ M * ‖y - x‖. This is a bound on the linearization error at x in terms of the distance between x and y.

Interpretation details:
- In Euclidean space, the Fréchet derivative fderiv ℝ f x is a continuous linear map v ↦ ∇f(x) · v. Its operator norm equals the Euclidean norm of the gradient ‖∇f(x)‖. So the hypothesis hM matches “‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M for all x ∈ U.”
- The expression (fderiv ℝ f x) (y - x) is exactly ∇f(x) · (y - x).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement
Natural statement: f has continuous partial derivatives on a convex set U. If ‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M for all x ∈ U, then |f(y) − f(x) − ∇f(x) · (y − x)| ≤ M ‖y − x‖.
- Regularity: “continuous partial derivatives” vs ContDiffOn ℝ 1 (C^1). In Mathlib, ContDiffOn is the standard rigorous formulation; it is a slightly stronger and precise version of the informal “has continuous partial derivatives,” and is appropriate for this context.
- Convexity: Both statements assume U is convex (Lean includes hU as a hypothesis, to be used in a proof; it does not need to appear in the conclusion).
- Bound on gradient: The Lean hypothesis on the operator norm of fderiv is equivalent to ‖∇f(x)‖ ≤ M in this setting.
- Conclusion: The inequality in Lean exactly matches the stated inequality, with absolute value and norms matching the Euclidean norms.

Step 3: Final check of faithfulness
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; the theorem statement directly encodes the intended claim.
- The identification of gradient norm with operator norm is standard and faithful in R^n.
- The small formal strengthening (ContDiffOn instead of “continuous partials”) is acceptable and common in formalizations.
- Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Note: Mathematically, under only the bound ‖∇f‖ ≤ M, a general bound for the linearization error is typically ≤ 2M‖y−x‖; the Lean/NL statement asserts the stronger constant M. However, the task is to assess faithfulness of translation, not mathematical correctness; the Lean statement matches the NL claim.

- Variables: `{𝕜 : Type*} [NormedField 𝕜] {E F : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E/F] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E/F]`. This sets up E and F as normed vector spaces over a normed field 𝕜 (a slight generalization of ℝ, acceptable).
- `theorem opNorm_add_le (A B : E →L[𝕜] F) : ...`: For continuous (i.e., bounded) linear maps A, B, the operator norm of A+B is at most the sum of the operator norms. Since the expression `(A + B)` has type `E →L[𝕜] F`, this also implicitly asserts that the sum of bounded operators is bounded.
- `theorem opNorm_smul (a : 𝕜) (A : E →L[𝕜] F) : ...`: The operator norm of a scalar multiple is ‖a‖ times the operator norm. The left-hand side uses `(a • A)` of type `E →L[𝕜] F`, so it also implicitly asserts closure under scalar multiplication (i.e., αA is bounded).
- `theorem opNorm_nonneg (A : E →L[𝕜] F) : 0 ≤ opNorm A`: Nonnegativity of the operator norm.
- `theorem opNorm_eq_zero_iff (A : E →L[𝕜] F) : opNorm A = 0 ↔ A = 0`: Definiteness of the operator norm (norm zero iff the operator is zero).
All names used are standard Mathlib notions; there are no fake/vacuous definitions.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- ""If A,B are linear and bounded, then A+B is bounded"": In Lean, A, B : E →L F already denote bounded linear maps. Writing `(A + B) : E →L F` uses Mathlib's instance that the sum is again a bounded linear map, and `opNorm_add_le` gives the standard triangle inequality for the operator norm; this is stronger than just boundedness and thus faithful.
- ""If α ∈ ℝ, then αA is bounded"": `opNorm_smul` both states the expected homogeneity and, by its very typing, shows closure under scalar multiplication (hence boundedness). The code generalizes from ℝ to an arbitrary normed field 𝕜, which is an acceptable slight generalization.
- ""‖·‖_{L(X,Y)} is a norm on L(X,Y)"": The four theorems `opNorm_nonneg`, `opNorm_eq_zero_iff`, `opNorm_add_le`, and `opNorm_smul` together are precisely the norm axioms for the operator norm on the space of bounded linear operators. Thus the code captures the claim that the operator norm is a norm on L(E,F).

3) Final comparison:
- The mathematical content matches, with a slight generalization from ℝ to any normed field 𝕜. No vacuous placeholders, all auxiliary statements are legitimate Mathlib facts about continuous linear maps and their operator norm. The translation is faithful.

- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem jirilebl_dummy : True := by trivial`: States and proves a theorem named `jirilebl_dummy` whose statement is simply `True`. The proof uses `trivial`, which closes the goal immediately since `True` is always provable.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is a specific theorem about Riemann integrable functions on [a, b], asserting the existence of a partition P such that for any choice of tags within each subinterval, the corresponding Riemann sum approximates the integral within epsilon. This involves definitions of Riemann integrability, partitions, tagged Riemann sums, and an epsilon-approximation.
- The provided Lean code does not mention functions, intervals, integrals, partitions, tags, or epsilon. It proves a vacuous statement (`True`). There is no attempt to formalize the target theorem.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem is unrelated to the provided mathematical statement. It neither states nor implies the desired property. There are no auxiliary definitions attempting to capture the notions in the natural-language statement.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `noncomputable def L (k : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) : ℝ → ℝ := fun y => integral (fun x => k (x, y) * f x) (0 : ℝ) 1`
  This defines the operator L for a kernel k: ℝ×ℝ → ℝ and a function f: ℝ → ℝ by L k f evaluated at y being the (interval) Lebesgue integral over x from 0 to 1 of k(x, y) * f(x). This matches Lf(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx. Although the natural language domain is [0,1]^2 and C([0,1], ℝ), the code extends k and f to ℝ × ℝ and ℝ respectively but will only use values on [0,1]. This is a standard harmless generalization.

- `theorem L_maps_continuous ... : ContinuousOn (L k f) (Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)` with hypotheses
  `hk : ContinuousOn k (Icc 0 1 ×ˢ Icc 0 1)` and `hf : ContinuousOn f (Icc 0 1)`
  This states that if k is continuous on [0,1]×[0,1] and f is continuous on [0,1], then y ↦ L k f y is continuous on [0,1]. This is exactly the “well-definedness” part: L maps continuous functions on [0,1] to continuous functions on [0,1].

- `theorem L_linear ... : L k (fun x => a * f x + b * g x) = fun y => a * L k f y + b * L k g y`
  This states the linearity of L in f: L(af + bg) = a L f + b L g, as an equality of functions ℝ → ℝ. This matches the requested linearity of the operator. It is even slightly more general since it does not assume f, g are continuous (or integrable), but that generalization is standard and still implies the desired statement when f and g are continuous on [0,1].

Whole translation vs. original statement:
- The original statement: k is continuous on [0,1]^2, define Lf(y) = ∫_0^1 k(x,y) f(x) dx. Show L maps C([0,1], ℝ) → C([0,1], ℝ) and is linear.
- The code:
  - Defines L exactly as the kernel integral operator.
  - Assumes k is continuous on [0,1]^2 and f is continuous on [0,1]; concludes Lf is continuous on [0,1].
  - States linearity of L.
This is a faithful formalization of the two parts (“well-definedness” and linearity). The use of Lebesgue interval integral instead of Riemann is standard and appropriate in mathlib; continuity on compact ensures integrability.

Final check for differences:
- Domain/codomain packaging: The code does not bundle L as a map between `ContinuousMap` spaces but proves the two required properties separately using `ContinuousOn`. This is acceptable.
- L is defined on all ℝ in the y-variable, but continuity is only claimed on [0,1], matching the original target space.
- Linearity is stated without hypotheses on f, g; this is a (potentially stronger) generalization, but it implies the original claim for continuous f, g. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used.
Overall, the code faithfully captures the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib; open Filter Set: Bring in Mathlib and open Filter/Set namespaces.
- def IsRiemannIntegrableOn' (f : ℝ → ℝ) (s : Set ℝ) : Prop := True: Defines a dummy predicate for “f is Riemann integrable on s” that is always true. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the real notion of Riemann integrability.
- def riemannIntegral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ := 0: Defines a dummy “Riemann integral” that is always 0 regardless of f, a, b. Also vacuous.
- The theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_riemann_1152 states: Given f : ℝ → ℝ, a b : ℝ, sequences a_n, b_n : ℕ → ℝ with (i) a < a_n n < b_n n < b, (ii) a_n → a and b_n → b, (iii) integrability on [a_n n, b_n n] via IsRiemannIntegrableOn' (trivially true), and (iv) boundedness of f on [a,b], then conclude: (A) f is integrable on [a,b] via IsRiemannIntegrableOn' (again trivially true), and (B) the sequence of “integrals” converges to the “integral” on [a,b] in the ε-N sense. However, because riemannIntegral is identically 0, the convergence statement reduces to |0 - 0| < ε for large n, which is trivially true for any ε > 0, independently of f, a, b, or the sequences.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement is a genuine theorem about Riemann integrability and convergence of Riemann integrals over expanding intervals approaching [a,b].
- The code uses dummy/vacuous definitions: IsRiemannIntegrableOn' := True and riemannIntegral := 0. This destroys the mathematical content. The hypotheses about integrability and the conclusion are automatically satisfied regardless of the actual function or intervals. Thus the code does not faithfully encode the intended theorem.
- The ε-N formulation for the limit is fine in principle, and the other hypotheses (boundedness, order relations, and convergence of endpoints) match the natural language assumptions, but because the core notions (integrability and integral) are vacuous, the statement is not faithful.

3) Final check and differences:
- Major discrepancy: integrability predicate is always true; integral is always 0. The theorem becomes trivially true and does not reflect the genuine mathematical content.
- The structure of assumptions otherwise mirrors the natural language statement, and the limit is expressed correctly as an ε-N statement, but these are overshadowed by the vacuous core definitions.
- Therefore, the Lean code is not a legitimate, faithful translation.

Given the use of vacuous placeholders, the translation fails. If those placeholders were replaced by legitimate Mathlib notions of Riemann integrability and the Riemann integral (or appropriate formalization, e.g., Henstock–Kurzweil, or Lebesgue integral with additional hypotheses), the final theorem statement would be faithful. Hence the appropriate grade reflects vacuous definitions but otherwise aligned structure.

2) Does the whole translation match the original statement?
- The natural language statement: Suppose {x_n} converges and x_n ≤ y_n for all n. Show that liminf x_n ≤ liminf y_n and limsup x_n ≤ limsup y_n.
- The Lean statements assert exactly the two inequalities under the hypothesis x n ≤ y n for all n. They do not assume convergence of {x_n}. This is a slight generalization (stronger result) because the inequalities hold regardless of convergence. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions; the theorems use standard Mathlib notions of liminf/limsup via filters.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same or different?
- Difference: The Lean code omits the extra hypothesis that {x_n} converges. However, the conclusions (the liminf and limsup inequalities) are the same and indeed valid without this hypothesis. This is a benign and standard generalization, not a mismatch.
- Everything else matches: same setting (real sequences), same pointwise inequality hypothesis, same conclusions for liminf and limsup.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful (indeed slightly stronger) and uses legitimate Mathlib constructs with no vacuous placeholders.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- import Mathlib and open Filter: sets up general math and topology/filter tools.
- variable {f : ℝ → ℝ} {PType : Type}: f is an arbitrary real-valued function on ℝ; PType is an arbitrary type (intended to represent partitions, but not specified as such).
- variable (P : ℕ → PType): a sequence P k of elements of PType (intended to be partitions), but no structure is assumed.
- variable (U L : PType → (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ): two arbitrary functionals that take an element of PType and a function f, returning a real number (intended to be upper and lower sums), but with no axioms linking them to actual upper/lower sums.
- variable (RiemannIntegrableOn : (ℝ → ℝ) → Prop): an arbitrary predicate on functions (intended to mean Riemann integrable on [a,b]), but with no interval and no semantics.
- variable (integral : (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ): an arbitrary functional on functions (intended to be the integral over [a,b]), but no interval and no semantics.
- Theorem statement: If h : Tendsto (k ↦ U (P k) f - L (P k) f) atTop (nhds 0), i.e., the difference U(P_k,f) − L(P_k,f) tends to 0 as k → ∞, then there exists I : ℝ such that both U(P_k,f) → I and L(P_k,f) → I, and moreover RiemannIntegrableOn f holds and integral f = I.

Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement is about a bounded function f : [a,b] → ℝ, a sequence of partitions P_k of [a,b], and the specific notions U(P_k,f), L(P_k,f) as upper and lower Darboux sums. It concludes Riemann integrability on [a,b] and that the integral over [a,b] equals the common limit of these sums.
- The Lean code lacks:
  - The interval [a,b]: f is ℝ → ℝ and no a,b appear anywhere.
  - The boundedness assumption on f.
  - Any formal notion of partitions: PType is arbitrary; P : ℕ → PType could be anything.
  - Any link that U and L are the upper/lower sums associated to partitions of [a,b]. They are completely unconstrained functions.
  - Any connection of RiemannIntegrableOn and integral to the interval [a,b]; they are arbitrary symbols not tied to Mathlib's definitions.
- Because U, L, RiemannIntegrableOn, and integral are arbitrary, the theorem asserts a strong and generally false claim: from just the difference U(P_k,f) − L(P_k,f) → 0, it deduces existence of limits for U(P_k,f) and L(P_k,f), integrability, and identification of integral with that limit. Without the structural ties and assumptions, this is not a faithful rendering.
- Furthermore, even if one intuits that U and L are upper/lower sums, the code does not enforce it; hence it fails the guideline about vacuous/placeholder definitions (here realized as unconstrained variables).

Final comparison:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code omits key hypotheses (interval, boundedness) and does not use Mathlib’s actual notions of partitions, upper/lower sums, Riemann integrability on [a,b], or definite integrals. It replaces them with arbitrary placeholders, so the translation is not legitimate or faithful.

- In common usage (and in mathlib), a proper map is typically a continuous map such that preimages of compact sets are compact. The code states these two components explicitly as hypotheses: `hf : Continuous f` and `h_proper : ∀ K, IsCompact K → IsCompact (f ⁻¹' K)`. 
- The codomain Y is assumed locally compact Hausdorff via typeclass assumptions `[LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`.
- The conclusion ""f is a closed map"" is formalized as: for every closed set `s` in `X`, its image `f '' s` is closed in `Y`.
Thus, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement, with the standard explicit formulation of ""proper"" in this context.

Step 3: Check for differences
- The code unpacks ""proper"" into its standard components (continuity + compact-preimage property) instead of using a single predicate. This is a standard and faithful way to formalize the notion in this context.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all hypotheses are meaningful. 
- The assumptions on Y match ""locally compact Hausdorff"" precisely. 
- The conclusion exactly matches the closed-map property.
No substantive differences or mismatches were found.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Use Mathlib.
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: Work in ℝ^n modeled as `(Fin n → ℝ)`.
- `variable (is_rectangle : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → Prop)`: Introduce an arbitrary predicate named `is_rectangle` on sets of ℝ^n (not tied to Mathlib's notion of rectangles).
- `variable (volume : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Introduce an arbitrary function `volume` from sets to real numbers (not Mathlib’s `volume`).
- `variable (Riemann_integrable_on : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → Prop)`: Introduce an arbitrary predicate meant to represent “Riemann integrable on a set”, but it’s completely uninterpreted.
- `variable (integral_on : Set (Fin n → ℝ) → ((Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ) → ℝ)`: Introduce an arbitrary function meant to represent the integral over a set, but again uninterpreted.
- `theorem integrable_on_union_of_rectangles ... : Riemann_integrable_on R f ∧ integral_on R f = integral_on R' f + integral_on R'' f := by sorry`: States the desired union property using the above arbitrary predicates/functions, with hypotheses:
  - `hR, hR', hR'': is_rectangle R/R'/R''` (R, R′, R″ are rectangles),
  - `hcover: R = R' ∪ R''`,
  - `hinter: is_rectangle (R' ∩ R'')`,
  - `hvol0: volume (R' ∩ R'') = 0`,
  - `hfiR'`, `hfiR'': Riemann_integrable_on R' f` and `Riemann_integrable_on R'' f`.
  Then concludes integrability on R and the additivity of `integral_on` across the union. The proof is left as `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The high-level shape of the theorem mirrors the desired statement: rectangles R′, R″ covering R; intersection has “volume 0”; f integrable on R′ and R″ implies f integrable on R with integral equal to the sum.
- However, all crucial mathematical notions (`is_rectangle`, `volume`, `Riemann_integrable_on`, `integral_on`) are not the Mathlib definitions but arbitrary variables with no constraints. This makes the statement effectively uninterpreted and not a faithful formalization of the Riemann integral on rectangles in ℝ^n.
- The natural language mentions “R′ ∩ R″ is a rectangle with one side of length 0 (so volume 0)”. The code assumes only `is_rectangle (R' ∩ R'')` and `volume (R' ∩ R'') = 0`, which is a slight weakening (it drops the explicit ‘one side length 0’ and goes straight to volume 0). That would be acceptable if the underlying notions were correct, but here they are arbitrary.
- The theorem proof uses `sorry`. While the task doesn’t require a proof, the presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the instructions, but the bigger issue is the lack of genuine definitions.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean code does not use Mathlib’s real notions of rectangle, volume (Lebesgue measure), or Riemann integrability/integral on a set. It instead quantifies over arbitrary placeholders, so the statement is not a legitimate, faithful translation of the original mathematical claim. If these were replaced with the genuine Mathlib definitions, the statement would be correct in spirit, but as written it is not faithful.

Given these issues, the translation fails due to use of uninterpreted placeholders for the core concepts.

- The theorem `proper_map_to_locally_compact_hausdorff_is_closed` states: for a function `f : X → Y`, if `h_cont : Continuous f` and `h_proper : ∀ K : Set Y, IsCompact K → IsCompact (f ⁻¹' K)` (i.e., the preimage of every compact subset of Y under f is compact), then for every set `S : Set X`, `IsClosed S → IsClosed (f '' S)` (the image of a closed set under f is closed). This is exactly the statement that f is a closed map.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: ""Every proper map f: X → Y to a locally compact Hausdorff space Y is closed.""
- In standard topology (and also in mathlib's conventions), a proper map typically means a continuous map with the property that preimages of compact sets are compact. The Lean statement explicitly assumes continuity and the compact-preimage property, and concludes f is a closed map. The codomain Y is assumed locally compact and Hausdorff. This matches the statement precisely.

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumptions: Y locally compact Hausdorff — matches. Properness: encoded as preimage of compact is compact plus separate continuity — standard definition of proper map. Conclusion: f is a closed map — expressed as ""for all closed S, f '' S is closed"". No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. No mismatch in generality or content.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the Mathlib library.
- `theorem jirilebl_ra_ch_riemann_3485 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h_rint h_abs : Prop) : ... := by sorry`
  Interpreted: For an arbitrary function `f : ℝ → ℝ` and two arbitrary propositions `h_rint` and `h_abs`, we assert an equivalence between two propositions:
  Left side: `(∃ L : ℝ, True)` meaning “there exists a real number L such that True holds,” i.e., trivially true and unrelated to integrals.
  Right side: `(∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ R : ℝ, R ≥ M → True)` meaning “for every ε > 0 there exists an M such that for all R ≥ M, True holds,” i.e., also a trivial tautology. Neither side references `f`, integrability, or any analytic condition. The hypotheses `h_rint` and `h_abs` are arbitrary placeholders and are not used.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
Original statement: Let f: [0, ∞) → ℝ be Riemann integrable on every [0, M] and absolutely integrable on [0, ∞). Show that the improper integral ∫_0^∞ f exists if and only if for every ε > 0 there exists M such that for all R ≥ M, |∫_M^R f| < ε.

Discrepancies:
- Domain: The Lean code uses `f : ℝ → ℝ`, not restricted to [0, ∞). No mention of restricting integrals to [0, ∞).
- Hypotheses: The conditions “Riemann integrable on every [0, M]” and “∫_0^∞ |f| < ∞” are replaced by arbitrary `Prop` placeholders (`h_rint`, `h_abs`) and are not used at all.
- Main equivalence: The left side should express “the improper integral of f on [0, ∞) exists (i.e., converges to some L).” Instead, it is “∃ L, True,” a tautology unrelated to f or integrals. The right side should be the tail condition `|∫_M^R f| < ε`; it is replaced by `True`, again a tautology.
- No use of Mathlib’s integral notions (Riemann/Bochner/integrability) or any real analysis content. The statement is entirely vacuous.

Step 3: Final check — are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code asserts a trivial equivalence (True ↔ True) with no connection to integrability, absolute integrability, or tails of integrals. The auxiliary placeholders are vacuous, and the final theorem does not capture the original statement’s meaning. Even though the quantifier pattern on the right hints at an ε–M–R structure, the core mathematical content is missing.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

There are no references to matrices, determinants, subsets of entries, combinatorial properties, or multilinearity. No theorems or definitions related to the natural language statement are present.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to formalize and show a combinatorial inequality about the sum of absolute values of certain determinant terms depending on a subset S of matrix entries, and to use this to prove that the determinant is multilinear in the rows. The provided Lean code does not attempt any of this: it neither states nor proves anything about determinants, matrices, subsets, sums, absolute values, or multilinearity.

They are completely different. The Lean code is entirely unrelated to the mathematical statement. There is no vacuous placeholder pretending to be the target statement; it simply does not address it at all. Hence it is not a faithful translation.

  - `by sorry`: proof omitted.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement asserts: If X is compact, path connected, and locally simply connected, then the fundamental group π₁(X, x0) is finitely generated.
- The Lean code does not state any of these properties. It replaces each with `True` and concludes `True`. It does not mention the fundamental group at all, nor any notion of “finitely generated” for that group. Thus, the code is entirely vacuous and does not formalize the intended theorem.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Hypotheses: Natural language requires genuine properties (CompactSpace X, PathConnectedSpace X or PathConnected X, LocallySimplyConnected X), while Lean code uses `True` placeholders.
- Conclusion: Natural language claims “π₁(X, x0) is finitely generated,” while Lean concludes `True` (trivial). No occurrence of the fundamental group, basepoint dependence, or finite generation predicate (e.g., `Subgroup.fg` of the fundamental group) appears.
- Therefore, the two statements are different; the Lean theorem is vacuous and unrelated to the intended content.

Given the rubric: this makes up vacuous hypotheses and a vacuous conclusion; even if the hypotheses were fixed, the conclusion would still be wrong. This matches the grade-3 category.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claims: ""Every continuous map f : X → Y from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is proper."" The Lean statement exactly formalizes this: assumes compact domain, Hausdorff codomain, continuity of f, and concludes IsProperMap f. In Mathlib, IsProperMap denotes the standard notion of proper map (which includes both continuity and compact-preimage property). Providing hf as a hypothesis matches the phrasing ""every continuous map ... is proper.""

3) Final check for differences:
- Assumptions: CompactSpace X and T2Space Y correctly model ""compact"" and ""Hausdorff."" 
- Hypothesis: hf : Continuous f matches ""continuous map."" 
- Conclusion: IsProperMap f matches ""is proper."" No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. There is no mismatch in generality or direction. Slight definitional variation (IsProperMap including continuity) is standard in Mathlib and compatible with the statement.

- The theorem `continuous_bijective_compact_to_t2_has_continuous_inverse` states: Given a function `f : X → Y` that is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`) and bijective (`hf_bij : Function.Bijective f`), there exists a function `g : Y → X` such that `g` is continuous and is both a left and right inverse of `f` (`Function.LeftInverse g f` and `Function.RightInverse g f`). In other words, `g` is a continuous inverse of `f`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
- In topology, being a homeomorphism is equivalent to having a continuous inverse. The code assumes `f` is continuous and bijective, and concludes the existence of a continuous inverse `g` with two-sided inverse properties. This exactly captures the content of the theorem.
- The use of `T2Space Y` precisely encodes that Y is Hausdorff. `CompactSpace X` encodes that X is compact. No extraneous assumptions are added.

3) Final check and differences:
- The code concludes with the existence of a continuous inverse rather than explicitly constructing a `Homeomorph`, but this is equivalent to the statement ""is a homeomorphism"" in standard mathematical usage. There are no auxiliary/vacuous definitions. The theorem statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.
- No discrepancies found.

- The natural language statement: For differentiable f : ℝ^n → ℝ at x0, show that the Euclidean norm of the gradient at x0 equals the operator norm of the derivative at x0, equivalently sup{|Df(x0) h| : ‖h‖ = 1}. This invokes the identification Df(x0) h = ⟪∇f(x0), h⟫ and the fact that the operator norm of a linear functional equals the norm of the representing vector in Euclidean space.
- The Lean theorem does not mention the gradient ∇f(x0) at all, nor the supremum over the unit sphere. It merely states that the norm of a continuous linear map equals its operator norm, which is a definitional identity in Mathlib. It neither establishes the link between the derivative and the gradient nor the sup characterization.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is a trivial identity about the norm on ContinuousLinearMap; it does not express that this norm equals the norm of the gradient vector or the sup over unit vectors. The differentiability assumption is superfluous and unused. The essential mathematical content of the original statement is missing.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line into natural language.
- The code works in ℝ with a subset I ⊆ ℝ and a function f : ℝ → ℝ. The point c ∈ I and a real number f' are given. The hypothesis h : HasDerivWithinAt f f' I c means that f has derivative f' at c when approaching c within the set I.

First theorem (differentiable_within_at_linear_approx):
- Assumptions: c ∈ I and f has derivative f' within I at c.
- Conclusion: There exist real numbers a and b such that for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 with the property that for all x with x ∈ I and |x - c| < δ, we have |a + b * (x - c) - f x| ≤ ε * |x - c|.
- This is the standard first-order linear approximation property (little-o of |x - c|), expressed in ε-δ form, within the set I.

Second theorem (differentiable_within_at_linear_approx_eq_g):
- Assumptions: same as above.
- Conclusion: There exist real numbers a, b and a function g : ℝ → ℝ such that:
  (i) For every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 so that for all x with x ∈ I and |x - c| < δ, we have |g x| ≤ ε. This expresses that g(x) → 0 as x → c within I.
  (ii) For all x ∈ I, we have |a + b * (x - c) - f x| = |x - c| * g x.
- This restates the linear approximation in a factorized form, with g tending to 0 along I.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The first theorem matches: from differentiability of f at c within I, it asserts the existence of a, b with |a + b(x - c) − f(x)| ≤ ε |x − c| for x ∈ I sufficiently close to c.
- The second theorem matches the “equivalently” part: it produces a function g with lim_{x→c, x∈I} g(x) = 0 and the equality |a + b(x − c) − f(x)| = |x − c| g(x). The code even requires equality for all x ∈ I, which is a harmless strengthening (one can define g(x) for all x ∈ I by the quotient when x ≠ c and pick a = f(c) to make the equality also hold at x = c). The limit condition is stated in the correct ε-δ form within I.
- The code takes f : ℝ → ℝ with a within-derivative on I, rather than f : I → ℝ, which is the standard way in Mathlib to formalize differentiability on a subset. This is a faithful formalization of “f : I → ℝ is differentiable at c ∈ I.”
- The hypothesis includes the specific derivative value f' (HasDerivWithinAt f f' I c), which is a standard strengthening of “differentiable” and does not change the content since differentiability implies that such an f' exists.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- Domain of g: the statement asks for g : I → ℝ; the code gives g : ℝ → ℝ but only specifies behavior on I. This is immaterial and faithful.
- Scope of equality in the second part: the natural statement says “for x near c,” while the code requires equality for all x ∈ I. This is a benign strengthening—one can define such a g so that equality holds everywhere in I (with a = f(c)), and it implies the near-c statement.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; all notions are standard Mathlib predicates (HasDerivWithinAt). The theorems themselves contain no fake definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are a faithful formalization (slightly stronger in the second part) of the given natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` introduces a natural number n, the dimension.
- `variable (A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin n → ℝ))` fixes a continuous linear operator A on the real normed space (Fin n → ℝ). In Mathlib, (Fin n → ℝ) is the type of real-valued functions on a finite set of size n, i.e., an n-dimensional real vector space with its standard Pi-norm (the sup norm).

- `theorem operator_norm_eq_sup_sphere : ∥A∥ = Sup (Set.image (fun x => ‖A x‖) ({x : Fin n → ℝ | ‖x‖ = 1} : Set (Fin n → ℝ))) := by sorry`
  This states that the operator norm of A equals the supremum of the set of values ‖A x‖ when x ranges over the unit sphere {x | ‖x‖ = 1} in (Fin n → ℝ).

- `theorem operator_norm_eq_sup_closed_ball : ∥A∥ = Sup (Set.image (fun x => ‖A x‖) ({x : Fin n → ℝ | ‖x‖ ≤ 1} : Set (Fin n → ℝ))) := by sorry`
  This states that the operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the closed unit ball {x | ‖x‖ ≤ 1}.

- `theorem operator_norm_eq_sup_open_ball : ∥A∥ = Sup (Set.image (fun x => ‖A x‖) ({x : Fin n → ℝ | ‖x‖ < 1} : Set (Fin n → ℝ))) := by sorry`
  This states that the operator norm of A equals the supremum of ‖A x‖ over the open unit ball {x | ‖x‖ < 1}.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement: For a linear operator A on ℝ^n, the operator norm defined by the maximum over the unit sphere equals the supremum over the closed unit ball and equals the supremum over the open unit ball.
- The code asserts exactly the two desired equalities with the sup over the closed ball and the sup over the open ball. It also includes an additional (compatible) equality expressing the operator norm as the supremum over the unit sphere.
- The code takes A to be a continuous linear map on (Fin n → ℝ) instead of a bare linear map on ℝ^n. In finite dimensions, every linear map is continuous, so this is a standard harmless strengthening. The underlying space (Fin n → ℝ) has the sup norm, whereas the phrase “ℝ^n” in natural language typically suggests the Euclidean 2-norm. However, the equivalence “operator norm = sup over closed ball = sup over open ball” is true for any normed space, so using the Pi/sup norm is a benign generalization rather than a change of mathematical content for these equalities.
- The natural language uses “max” on the unit sphere. The code uses Sup (supremum), not Max. In finite dimensions, the maximum is attained on the compact unit sphere, so max equals sup. Thus, expressing it via Sup is consistent with the intended meaning.

3) Final check for differences:
- Differences:
  - Space/norm: code uses (Fin n → ℝ) with sup norm; natural language likely intends ℝ^n with Euclidean norm. The result being proved (equality with suprema over closed/open balls) is independent of the concrete norm and holds in any normed space, so this is a harmless generalization.
  - The code includes an extra equality (to the sup over the sphere) not explicitly requested. This does not conflict with the statement and is aligned with the definition mentioned in the problem.
  - Edge case n = 0: the unit sphere is empty; the Sup over an empty set is a default value in mathlib. The natural language typically assumes n ≥ 1 implicitly. This is a minor technicality and not a faithfulness issue.

Conclusion: The code faithfully formalizes the intended statement (and slightly generalizes the norm on ℝ^n), with no vacuous placeholders or misleading definitions.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code into natural language.
- `variable {n : ℕ}`: We are working in R^n, indexed as functions `Fin n → ℝ`.
- The theorem `linear_functional_opNorm_eq_norm (b : Fin n → ℝ) (B : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] ℝ) (h : ∀ x, B x = ∑ i : Fin n, b i * x i) : ‖B‖ = ‖b‖` states: Let b be a vector in R^n (represented as a function from `Fin n` to ℝ). Let B be a continuous linear functional from R^n to ℝ. Assume B acts by the formula B x = Σ_i b_i x_i for all x. Then the operator norm of B equals the norm of b.
- Here, `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the standard representation of ℝ^n used in Mathlib, and the sum `∑ i, b i * x i` is the standard real inner product with x. The norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the Euclidean norm (coming from the inner product), so ‖b‖ is the Euclidean norm of b, and ‖B‖ is the operator norm induced by these norms.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language: Using the standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^n, suppose B ∈ L(ℝ^n, ℝ) is defined by Bx = b · x for a vector b ∈ ℝ^n. Then the operator norm of B equals the Euclidean norm of b.
- Lean code: Exactly the same content: B is a continuous linear map (bounded linear functional), defined pointwise by Bx = Σ b_i x_i = b · x, and concludes ‖B‖ = ‖b‖, where the norms are those on ℝ^n (Euclidean) and ℝ.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The only potential subtlety is ensuring the norm on `(Fin n → ℝ)` is the Euclidean norm. In Mathlib, `(Fin n → ℝ)` carries the standard real inner product (dot product) and hence the Euclidean norm, so this matches the statement “Using the standard Euclidean norm on ℝ^n.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The theorem’s hypothesis matches the “Bx = b · x” definition, and the conclusion matches “operator norm equals Euclidean norm.”
- Therefore, the code is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

  Natural language: For any type α equipped with a topological space structure and such that α is compact (i.e., has an instance `[CompactSpace α]`), and for any subset s of α, if s is closed in α (`IsClosed s`), then s is compact as a subset of α (`IsCompact s`). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but that does not affect the statement's meaning.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The original statement is exactly: ""Prove that a closed subset of a compact space is compact."" The Lean statement asserts precisely this: in a compact topological space α, any closed subset s is compact. It uses standard Mathlib notions `IsClosed`, `IsCompact`, and `CompactSpace`, matching the mathematical content.

3) Final check for differences:

- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.
Thus, the two statements are the same.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] [ProperSpace X]`: We fix a type X equipped with a metric space structure and, additionally, we assume X is a proper metric space (i.e., closed and bounded subsets are compact; equivalently, closed balls are compact).
- `theorem closed_bounded_compact {S : Set X} (hclosed : IsClosed S) (hbounded : Bounded S) : IsCompact S := by sorry`: In this context, for any subset S of X, if S is closed and bounded (in the metric sense), then S is compact. The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the statement is exactly: in a proper metric space, closed and bounded implies compact.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement says: Let X be a metric space. If S ⊆ X is closed and bounded, then S is compact.
- The Lean code adds an extra hypothesis: `[ProperSpace X]`. So it asserts the conclusion only for proper metric spaces, not for arbitrary metric spaces.

3) Final comparison:
- The two statements are different. The original claims the result for all metric spaces; this is false in general. The Lean code proves a correct specialization: in proper metric spaces, closed and bounded sets are compact. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; all terms are standard Mathlib. However, due to the added properness assumption, the translation is not faithful to the original statement.

Overall: Not faithful (extra hypothesis), but otherwise a reasonable formalization of a corrected version.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- `def SequentiallyCompactSpace (X : Type _) [MetricSpace X] : Prop := True`: This introduces a new predicate named `SequentiallyCompactSpace` for metric spaces and defines it to be `True` for every metric space. This is explicitly a placeholder and not Mathlib's real notion of sequential compactness. Thus, it is a vacuous definition.
- `theorem metric_compact_iff_sequentially_compact {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] : CompactSpace X ↔ SequentiallyCompactSpace X := by sorry`: States that for a metric space `X`, `CompactSpace X` is equivalent to `SequentiallyCompactSpace X` (the placeholder). The proof is omitted with `sorry`.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asserts: a metric space X is compact if and only if X is sequentially compact (the genuine notion). In Mathlib, there are standard definitions (e.g., sequential compactness is a known property for sets/spaces; one can express it via `IsSeqCompact (Set.univ)` or similar). The code replaces the genuine notion with a vacuous predicate (`:= True`). Therefore, the theorem being stated is not the intended equivalence; it is instead asserting compactness is equivalent to a trivially true property. This is not faithful.

3) Final comparison and discrepancies:
- The code introduces a vacuous placeholder `SequentiallyCompactSpace` rather than using Mathlib’s real sequential compactness. This violates the guideline against vacuous placeholders.
- The theorem statement then uses this placeholder, so it is not the same mathematical statement as the original.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), which by itself could be acceptable per the instructions, but the main issue is the placeholder definition.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful. If the placeholder were replaced by the real Mathlib notion of sequential compactness, the final theorem would match the statement. Hence, it merits a mid-level grade as per the rubric for vacuous placeholders with otherwise faithful intent.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is stated for natural numbers n and m, and for A a continuous linear map A : (Fin n → ℝ) →L[ℝ] (Fin m → ℝ). Here (Fin n → ℝ) is the standard ℝ^n modeled as functions on a finite type, equipped with the canonical norm from Mathlib (the sup norm on coordinates for the Pi space). Likewise for (Fin m → ℝ).
- It asserts three equalities, conjoined by ∧:
  a) ∥A∥ equals the supremum (iSup) over the unit sphere {x : ‖x‖ = 1} of ‖A x‖.
  b) ∥A∥ equals the supremum over the closed unit ball {x : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} of ‖A x‖.
  c) ∥A∥ equals the supremum over the open unit ball {x : ‖x‖ < 1} of ‖A x‖.
- There is no auxiliary definition; the proof is omitted with sorry. The statement uses standard Mathlib notions: continuous linear maps →L[ℝ], the operator norm ∥A∥, and iSup over subtypes.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: For any norm on ℝ^n (and, implicitly, also a norm on ℝ^m, since the operator norm depends on both), the induced operator norm on L(ℝ^n, ℝ^m) satisfies ∥A∥ = max{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ = 1} = sup{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} = sup{‖Ax‖ : ‖x‖ < 1}. It emphasizes the unit sphere is compact in finite dimensions, yielding a maximum on the sphere.
- The Lean code specializes to the specific canonical norms on (Fin n → ℝ) and (Fin m → ℝ) (the Pi/sup norms), rather than “any norm” on ℝ^n, ℝ^m. This is a specialization, not the fully general statement.
- The code states equality with the supremum (iSup) over the sphere, not the maximum. Numerically, if a maximum exists, it equals the supremum; but the code does not assert existence of a maximizer. The natural statement explicitly uses “max” for the sphere, asserting attainment, relying on compactness; the code omits this attainment claim.
- The code uses continuous linear maps →L; in finite dimensions, all linear maps are continuous for any norm, so this is not a substantive difference.
- Potential edge case: n = 0. Then the unit sphere {‖x‖ = 1} is empty; the natural-language “max” would be undefined, whereas the Lean statement uses iSup over a potentially empty index type. The code does not exclude n = 0. This deviates from the natural statement’s intent (which usually presumes a nonempty sphere when speaking of a maximum).

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Core content: equality of the operator norm with the sup over the closed and open unit ball is present and matches the standard fact.
- Differences:
  • Generality: The natural statement claims validity for any norms on ℝ^n (and implicitly ℝ^m); the Lean code fixes the canonical Pi norms on (Fin n → ℝ) and (Fin m → ℝ). This is a specialization.
  • Max vs Sup on the sphere: The natural statement asserts existence of a maximizer (max), while the Lean theorem only states equality with the supremum, not asserting the maximum is attained.
  • Possible degenerate case n = 0 and emptiness of the unit sphere is not addressed in the code but would matter for the “max” phrasing.

Given these discrepancies, especially the omission of the “max”/attainment part and the specialization to a particular norm rather than “any norm,” the translation is close but not fully faithful. There are no vacuous or fake definitions, and the structure is sound, but it does not capture the “max” claim nor the full generality.

- Goal: `∃ g : Y → X, Continuous g ∧ (g ∘ f = id) ∧ (f ∘ g = id)` asserts there exists a function g from Y to X that is continuous and is a two-sided inverse of f (g ∘ f is the identity on X and f ∘ g is the identity on Y).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: a continuous bijection f from a compact space X to a Hausdorff space Y is a homeomorphism. In standard topology, this means f has a continuous inverse. The Lean statement exactly asserts the existence of a continuous inverse g with the right and left inverse equalities, given that f is continuous and bijective and the space assumptions (compact X, Hausdorff Y) hold. This is equivalent to saying f is a homeomorphism.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Hypotheses match: X compact, Y Hausdorff, f continuous and bijective.
- Conclusion matches: existence of a continuous inverse with two-sided inverse equalities, which is precisely the condition that f is a homeomorphism (together with hf). While the conclusion is phrased in terms of a function g rather than the Homeomorph structure, it is mathematically equivalent to “f is a homeomorphism.”
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced. The `sorry` is only in the proof, not affecting the statement's faithfulness.

Therefore, the translation is faithful.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- The theorem is named `closed_injective_closed_map_into_locally_compact_t2_homeomorph_range` and is stated for types X and Y with topologies. Y is assumed to be locally compact and Hausdorff (`[LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]`).
- We have a function `f : X → Y` with three hypotheses: `hf_cont : Continuous f`, `hf_closed : IsClosedMap f` (i.e., f sends closed sets to closed sets), and `hf_inj : Injective f`.
- Conclusion: `Homeomorph X (Subtype (Set.range f))`. This asserts the existence of a homeomorphism between X and the subtype consisting of points of Y in the range of f (i.e., the image treated with the subspace topology). The proof is omitted via `sorry`.

2) Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: ""Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space and f : X → Y a closed injection. Prove that f is a homeomorphism onto its image.""
- The code adds an explicit continuity assumption `Continuous f`, which the natural language does not state. In general, continuity is necessary if the conclusion is that f itself is a homeomorphism onto its image. So the code is a strengthening of hypotheses (a specialization), which is acceptable and standard.
- However, the conclusion in Lean only produces ""some"" homeomorphism between X and range f, not that the specific map induced by f (x ↦ ⟨f x, _⟩) is the homeomorphism. The natural statement claims that f itself (viewed as a map into its image) is a homeomorphism. The code’s statement is strictly weaker: existence of a homeomorphism does not imply that f is that homeomorphism.
- The extra assumptions `[LocallyCompactSpace Y] [T2Space Y]` are stronger than needed (the statement with continuous + closed + injective doesn’t require LCH or T2), but adding extra hypotheses is acceptable as a specialization.

3) Final check:
- Differences:
  - The code requires continuity; the natural language does not mention it. This is a harmless specialization (and arguably necessary for the intended conclusion).
  - Crucially, the code asserts mere existence of a homeomorphism between X and the image, not that f itself (as a map into its image) is that homeomorphism. This is weaker than the natural language statement and thus not faithful to the specific claim about f.
- No vacuous auxiliary definitions: there are none. The presence of `sorry` is allowed under the given auditing guidelines.

Conclusion: Close, but not faithful, because it does not assert that the homeomorphism is given by f.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]`: We work over a real normed vector space E.
- `theorem ... (f : E → ℝ) {x0 : E} (hf : HasFDerivAt f (fderiv ℝ f x0) x0) : ...`: Assume f is Fréchet differentiable at x0 with derivative given by `fderiv ℝ f x0`.
- Statement: `∀ h, |f (x0 + h) - f x0 - (fderiv ℝ f x0 : E →L[ℝ] ℝ) h| ≤ ‖(fderiv ℝ f x0 : E →L[ℝ] ℝ)‖ * ‖h‖ + ‖h‖ ^ 2`.
  In words: For every h in E, the absolute error of the linear approximation at x0 is bounded above by the operator norm of the derivative times ‖h‖ plus ‖h‖^2. This bound is asserted to hold for all h, with a fixed quadratic remainder term and fixed coefficient 1.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Original statement: For f : ℝ^n → ℝ, differentiable at x0, we have as h → 0:
  |f(x0+h) − f(x0) − Df(x0)h| ≤ ‖Df(x0)‖‖h‖ + o(‖h‖).
  This is an asymptotic inequality: the remainder is bounded by the operator norm term plus a term that is little-o of ‖h‖; i.e., for every ε > 0, for sufficiently small ‖h‖, the remainder ≤ ‖Df‖‖h‖ + ε‖h‖.

- Differences:
  • Domain: Lean generalizes from ℝ^n to a general real normed space E. This is a benign generalization and acceptable.
  • Asymptotic vs pointwise: The original uses an “as h → 0” little-o statement. The Lean code instead states a pointwise inequality that holds for all h (no “for small h” or limit), which is strictly stronger and not equivalent to an o(‖h‖) statement.
  • Nature of the small-o term: The original has an unspecified o(‖h‖) term. The Lean code hardcodes a specific bound ‖h‖^2 with fixed coefficient 1. In general, from differentiability one cannot guarantee a global bound of the form |remainder| ≤ ‖h‖^2 for all h (or even for all sufficiently small h with fixed coefficient 1). Little-o only guarantees: for every ε > 0, small ‖h‖ implies |remainder| ≤ ε‖h‖. Turning this into |remainder| ≤ ‖h‖^2 uniformly (or even eventually with coefficient 1) is not justified.
  • Quantification: The original inequality is asymptotic; the Lean theorem claims a uniform inequality for all h.

3) Final check:
- The Lean statement is not a faithful formalization. It asserts a much stronger (and generally false) global bound with a specific ‖h‖^2 term and for all h, instead of an asymptotic little-o term as h → 0. While the operator norm piece matches, the replacement of o(‖h‖) by ‖h‖^2 and the change in quantification materially change the statement.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `open Set` just opens the namespace for set-theoretic notation like `''` for image.
- The theorem statement: For types `X` and `Y` with topologies, given a function `f : X → Y` that is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`) and assuming `X` is compact as a space (`hX : CompactSpace X`), then for every subset `s : Set X`, if `s` is closed (`IsClosed s`) then its image `f '' s` is closed in `Y` (`IsClosed (f '' s)`).
- This is exactly the definition that `f` is a closed map: it maps closed sets to closed sets. No additional assumptions (like Hausdorff) are included.

Comparing to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement says: “Prove that if X is compact and f : X → Y is continuous, then f is closed.”
- In topology, “X is compact” usually means the whole space is compact, which in mathlib is expressed by `CompactSpace X`. “f is closed” means `∀ s, IsClosed s → IsClosed (f '' s)`. The code uses exactly these notions.
- There is no extra structure or hypothesis in the Lean statement; in particular, no Hausdorff/T2 assumption on `Y`, matching the given natural language statement (even though, mathematically, such a theorem would usually require `Y` Hausdorff for the image of compact sets to be closed; but we are auditing translation fidelity, not correctness).

Final check:
- The code precisely formalizes the natural language statement: continuous map from a compact space is a closed map. No vacuous or auxiliary definitions are introduced. The proof is omitted (`by sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing instructions.
- Therefore, the translation is faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib`: Bring in Mathlib.
- The theorem `compact_space_prod_iff {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] : CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y ↔ CompactSpace (X × Y)` states: for any types X and Y equipped with topological space structures, X and Y are both compact (as CompactSpace instances) if and only if their product X × Y is compact (as a CompactSpace). The proof is omitted with `sorry`, which is acceptable per the instructions since we're only checking the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The English statement says: ""Topological spaces X and Y are both compact just when their product is compact."" This is exactly the biconditional the Lean code states: `CompactSpace X ∧ CompactSpace Y ↔ CompactSpace (X × Y)`.

3) Final check and differences:
- The Lean statement is a direct formalization of the natural language claim, with no extra hypotheses or restrictions. There are no auxiliary definitions, and the concepts used are standard Mathlib notions.
- Note: Mathematically, the ⇐ direction generally requires nonemptiness of the other factor (since projections need to be surjective), but the natural language sentence also did not include nonemptiness assumptions. This does not affect faithfulness; both present the same claim.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

  Natural-language reading of the formal statement: Given four arbitrary propositions named `Haus`, `PathConnected`, `LocallySimplyConnected`, and `p_universal`, conclude that the two arbitrary types `Deck` and `π1X` are equal. No link is established between these propositions and the topological data (X, Xtil, p). No group structures or isomorphisms are present, and no action law is encoded. The proof is left as `sorry`.

Faithfulness assessment to the original statement:
- The original statement: For X Hausdorff, path connected, and locally simply connected, the deck transformation group of the universal cover p : X~ → X is isomorphic to π1(X), with group law corresponding to path concatenation [γ]·[η] = [γ * η]. This requires:
  - Actual definitions of universal covering, deck transformation group (as a group of automorphisms over X), and the fundamental group π1(X) (with a basepoint and group law by concatenation).
  - A group isomorphism (not equality of types) between the deck group and π1(X), and the explicit identification of the group law.
- The Lean code does not define or refer to Mathlib's notions of covering spaces, deck transformations, or π1. Instead, it introduces arbitrary `Prop` placeholders (`Haus`, `PathConnected`, `LocallySimplyConnected`, `p_universal`) unrelated to X, and arbitrary `Type`s `Deck` and `π1X`.
- The conclusion `Deck = π1X` is a much stronger and different statement than an isomorphism of groups: it asserts definitional equality of types, without any structure, and misses the group structure entirely.
- The action law [γ]·[η] = [γ * η] is not captured at all in the statement.

Final comparison:
- Different in multiple crucial ways: vacuous hypotheses and objects, missing group structures, equality vs isomorphism, no dependence on X/p, no basepoint, no action law. Therefore, the code is not a faithful translation.

Grade rationale:
- It introduces vacuous placeholders and the final theorem, even if placeholders were replaced by real definitions, asserts type equality rather than a group isomorphism with the specified multiplication correspondence. According to the rubric, this fits “makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful.” A grade of 3 is appropriate.

  Natural language: A metric space X is called sequentially compact if for every sequence s: ℕ → X, there exist a point x in X and a function φ: ℕ → ℕ such that the composed sequence s ∘ φ converges to x.
  Issue: This definition does not require φ to be strictly increasing (i.e., a genuine subsequence). Without strict monotonicity, one can choose φ to be constantly 0 and x = s 0, so s ∘ φ is the constant sequence at s 0, which trivially converges. Hence, as defined, sequentially_compact X is essentially always true, making the definition vacuous and not faithful to the standard notion of sequential compactness.
- theorem sequentially_compact_metric_compact {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] (h : sequentially_compact X) : IsCompact (univ : Set X) := by sorry
  Natural language: In a metric space, if X is sequentially compact, then the whole space X (i.e., univ) is compact. In Mathlib, IsCompact univ is equivalent to “every open cover of X has a finite subcover.” The statement matches the intended conclusion of the natural language claim (sequential compactness implies compactness).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural statement: Let X be a metric space and suppose X is sequentially compact. Prove that every open cover of X admits a finite subcover.
- The theorem’s conclusion (IsCompact univ) is equivalent to “every open cover has a finite subcover,” so that part is faithful.
- However, the crucial auxiliary definition of sequentially compact is incorrect: it omits the requirement that φ is strictly increasing (a true subsequence). As written, the property is trivial and holds for any sequence by taking a constant φ, so the hypothesis h is essentially vacuous. Thus, the Lean code does not faithfully represent the meaning of “sequentially compact.”

- Different: The Lean code’s definition of sequentially compact is too weak (indeed, vacuous in metric spaces), whereas the natural language notion requires every sequence to have a convergent subsequence (with strictly increasing indices). Because the key hypothesis is mistranslated, the overall formalization is not faithful, even though the final theorem statement (compactness of univ) matches the intended conclusion.

Therefore, the translation fails due to the incorrect, effectively vacuous definition of sequential compactness. If the definition were corrected to require a strictly increasing φ (e.g., StrictMono φ), the theorem statement would be faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Imports Mathlib. No effect on the statement itself.
- `variable (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X]`: Introduces a type `X` equipped with a topological space structure.
- `def PathConnected (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`: Defines a placeholder predicate for path-connectedness; it is identically `True` and thus vacuous.
- `def LocallySimplyConnected (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True`: Defines a placeholder predicate for locally simply connected; also identically `True` and vacuous.
- `def IsUniversalCover {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : Y → X) : Prop := True`: Defines a placeholder predicate asserting that `p` is a universal cover; again identically `True` and vacuous.
- Theorem statement:
  `theorem path_connected_locally_simply_connected_has_universal_cover (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (h1 : PathConnected X) (h2 : LocallySimplyConnected X) : ∃ (Y : Type*) (topY : TopologicalSpace Y) (p : Y → X), IsUniversalCover (p : Y → X) := by sorry`
  Natural language paraphrase: If `X` is a topological space and satisfies `PathConnected X` and `LocallySimplyConnected X`, then there exists a type `Y`, a topological space structure on `Y`, and a map `p : Y → X` such that `IsUniversalCover p` holds.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The intended natural language statement: Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space `X` has a universal covering space `\tilde X → X`.
- The Lean theorem mirrors the existential structure (there exists a space `Y` with a topology and a map `p : Y → X` that is a universal cover). However, all key predicates—PathConnected, LocallySimplyConnected, and IsUniversalCover—are defined as `True`, i.e., vacuous placeholders. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must be legitimate and not vacuous. Therefore, the statement as formalized does not capture the intended mathematical content.
- No additional illegitimate constructions beyond these placeholders are present, but the placeholders themselves render the translation unfaithful.

Final comparison:
- Same: Overall shape of the theorem (hypotheses about `X`, existence of `Y` and `p : Y → X` that is a universal cover) matches the natural language.
- Different: The predicates representing the hypotheses and the conclusion are vacuous (`:= True`), so the formal statement does not actually assert anything about path connectedness, local simple connectivity, or universal covers. Hence, the translation fails to be faithful.

Given the rubric: this makes up vacuous definitions; if replaced with proper Mathlib predicates, the final theorem statement would be faithful. So it fits the category where, if fixed, it would be faithful.

  Natural language: For arbitrary types P, Q (only Q has a topology), for any function φ : P → Q, for any proposition named ""smooth"", and any natural numbers dimP, dimQ with dimP < dimQ, conclude that the image of φ is nowhere dense in Q.

2) Faithfulness assessment:
- The original statement is about smooth maps between smooth manifolds, with manifold dimensions satisfying dim P < dim Q.
- The Lean code does not provide manifold structures on P or Q (no charts, no model spaces, not even TopologicalSpace on P). It only assumes [TopologicalSpace Q].
- The hypothesis ""(smooth : Prop)"" is a completely vacuous placeholder, not tied to φ or to any manifold structures.
- The dimensions ""dimP dimQ : Nat"" are unrelated to P and Q; they are arbitrary numbers, not the manifold dimensions. There is no connection between these numbers and P or Q.
- Therefore, the theorem statement asserts a vastly stronger and incorrect claim: for any function φ between arbitrary types (with Q topological), and for any numbers dimP < dimQ and any proposition ""smooth"", the range is nowhere dense. This is not the original statement at all.
- There are no auxiliary definitions, but the use of a bare ""smooth : Prop"" and unrelated dimension parameters constitutes vacuous placeholders per the guidelines.

3) Final check:
- Original: Smooth φ between manifolds P, Q, with dim P < dim Q (manifold dimensions) ⇒ φ(P) is nowhere dense in Q.
- Lean: Arbitrary φ: P → Q, Q topological, arbitrary Prop ""smooth"", arbitrary Nat dimP, dimQ with dimP < dimQ ⇒ range φ is nowhere dense.
- These are different statements. The Lean code omits manifold and smoothness structure and does not tie dimensions to P and Q.

Conclusion: Not a faithful translation.

",2,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code.
- The theorem continuous_eq_on_dense is stated for arbitrary topological spaces X and Y.
- hY asserts that Y is Hausdorff (T2): for any distinct y1 ≠ y2 in Y, there exist disjoint open sets U, V with y1 ∈ U and y2 ∈ V.
- f, g : X → Y are continuous (hf, hg).
- A : Set X and hA says A is dense using the neighborhood formulation: for every x ∈ X and every open neighborhood U of x, there exists a ∈ A with a ∈ U. This is equivalent to A being dense (every nonempty open set intersects A).
- hfg states f and g agree on A: ∀ a ∈ A, f a = g a.
- Conclusion: f = g.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- The natural language statement says: Let X be Hausdorff and Y any topological space. If f, g : X → Y are continuous and agree on a dense subset of X, then f = g.
- The Lean code instead assumes Y is Hausdorff and X arbitrary. This is the standard correct hypothesis for this result (the equalizer is closed when the codomain is Hausdorff), but it does not match the given statement.
- The density condition and agreement on A are correctly formalized.

Step 3: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The roles of Hausdorffness are swapped: the natural language requires X Hausdorff, Y arbitrary; the Lean theorem requires Y Hausdorff, X arbitrary. These are not equivalent conditions. The code formalizes a different theorem.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions. The proof is omitted (by sorry), but we are only auditing the statement.

Conclusion: Not faithful to the provided statement due to the crucial swap of the Hausdorff assumption.

This states: For any index type ι and any family of types α indexed by ι, each equipped with a topological space structure, the product space (the dependent function type Π i, α i with the product topology) is compact if and only if each factor space α i is compact. In words: the product is compact iff all the factors are compact.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
The statement given is: ""Prove that every product of topological spaces is compact if and only if a product of compact topological spaces is compact.""
- The Lean theorem corresponds to the standard equivalence: for a given product, compactness of the product is equivalent to compactness of each factor.
- The natural language, as written, asserts an equivalence between two global meta-statements: (LHS) ""every product of topological spaces is compact"" and (RHS) ""a product of compact topological spaces is compact."" As written, LHS is much stronger and false in general, while RHS is Tychonoff's theorem. These two are not equivalent.
- It is very plausible the intended meaning was the standard equivalence: ""A product of topological spaces is compact if and only if each factor is compact"" (i.e., the Lean statement). But strictly parsing the English sentence, it does not match the Lean statement; the Lean statement talks about compactness of the product iff all factors are compact, not about equivalence of two global claims.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Lean: For all families, Compact(product) ↔ ∀ i, Compact(factor i).
- Natural language (literal reading): (For all products, compact) ↔ (For all products of compact spaces, compact). These are not the same: the Lean statement is the correct local equivalence for a given product; the English statement is an incorrect equivalence between two global properties.

Conclusion: The Lean code states the standard and correct equivalence (product compact iff each factor compact). The natural language statement, as written, is not the same. Therefore, the translation is not faithful, although it is very likely what the author intended.

end
",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variable {X Y : Type _} (f : X → Y)`: We have two arbitrary types X and Y and a function f from X to Y. There is no topological structure assumed.
- `structure CoveringMap (f : X → Y) : Prop := (out : True)`: The predicate ""CoveringMap f"" is defined as a structure containing a proof of True. This makes every function f a covering map; it's a placeholder and vacuous.
- `def π1 (X : Type _) (x : X) := PUnit`: The fundamental group at a basepoint x is defined to be the unit type PUnit (a single-element type). This is a placeholder; it does not represent the actual fundamental group.
- `def f_star (f : X → Y) (x : X) : π1 X x → π1 Y (f x) := fun _ => PUnit.unit`: The induced map on fundamental groups is the constant map from the singleton type to the singleton type; again a placeholder.
- `theorem covering_map_induced_map_injective ... : Function.Injective (f_star f x) := by sorry`: The statement says the induced map on fundamental groups is injective. No proof is given, but the type of the statement asserts injectivity of the placeholder `f_star`.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: ""The morphism of fundamental groups f_*: π1(X) → π1(Y) induced by a covering map f: X → Y on a Hausdorff space X is injective.""
- Missing assumptions: The Lean code does not assume any topological structure (no `TopologicalSpace X`/`Y`, no Hausdorff/T2 assumption on X). It treats X, Y as plain types.
- Covering map: The code uses a vacuous placeholder for `CoveringMap`, making every function a covering map. This does not reflect the true concept.
- Fundamental group: The code defines π1 as the unit type, not the actual fundamental group. Consequently, injectivity of any map is trivial or meaningless.
- Induced map: The code defines a trivial constant map between unit types, not the genuine induced map on fundamental groups.
Thus the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the intended topological assertion.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
They are different.
- The Lean code ignores topology and the Hausdorff assumption on X.
- It replaces the fundamental group by a trivial type and the covering map by a vacuous predicate, and the induced map by a constant map.
- Even if we ignore the proof, the statement in Lean would, after fixing placeholders, still need additional hypotheses (topological spaces and Hausdorff) to match the natural language. As written, it claims a stronger, different statement (no Hausdorff, no topology) and uses vacuous definitions.
Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- `variable {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [T2Space X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [CompactSpace Y]`: Introduces two types X and Y with the following structure:
  - X is a topological space (`[TopologicalSpace X]`), and X is Hausdorff (`[T2Space X]`).
  - Y is a topological space (`[TopologicalSpace Y]`) and Y is compact (`[CompactSpace Y]`).
- `theorem prod_fst_is_closed_map : IsClosedMap (Prod.fst : X × Y → X) := by sorry`: States the theorem that the first projection map from the product space X × Y to X (i.e., `(x, y) ↦ x`) is a closed map, under the above assumptions. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, which is acceptable for translation auditing.

Assessing faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Let X be a Hausdorff topological space and Y any compact topological space. Prove that the first projection X × Y → X is a closed map.""
- Lean assumptions match exactly: X is Hausdorff (T2Space X), Y is compact (CompactSpace Y), both are topological spaces.
- The conclusion matches exactly: `IsClosedMap (Prod.fst : X × Y → X)`.

Final check for discrepancies:
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; only the theorem statement appears.
- The statement is not weaker or stronger than the natural language claim (it matches the given assumptions). Note: mathematically, the Hausdorff condition on X is not necessary for the result, but since the natural language hypothesis includes it, the Lean statement faithfully mirrors it.
- Therefore, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the given statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib` imports the Mathlib library. This sets up the environment but does not assert anything about the specific statement.
- `example : True := by trivial` states and proves the proposition `True`. This is a standalone trivial example, unrelated to topology or continuity.

This code contains no variables `X`, `Y`, no topological structures, no function `f`, no assumptions of continuity, bijectivity, or Hausdorffness, and no statement or proof about the continuity of the inverse.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement asks to prove: given a continuous bijection `f : X → Y` from a topological space `X` to a Hausdorff space `Y`, the inverse `f⁻¹ : Y → X` is continuous. The provided Lean code does not attempt to formalize any part of this claim. It neither states the theorem nor introduces the necessary context. Thus, it is not a translation at all.

They are completely different. The Lean code proves `True`, while the natural language statement is about continuity of an inverse under specific topological assumptions. Additionally, as a side remark (not affecting the faithfulness judgment), the natural language statement is false in general without additional hypotheses (e.g., compactness of `X` or closedness/openness of `f`). Regardless, the code does not address the intended claim in any way.

- Lean: exactly asserts the equivalence `Dense A ↔ closure A = univ` for a topological space X and subset A ⊆ X.

Discrepancies:

This announces a topological generalization of the manifold statement.
- `theorem proper_local_homeomorph_is_covering {P Q : Type _} [TopologicalSpace P] [TopologicalSpace Q] (f : P → Q) (hlocal : IsLocalHomeomorph f) (hproper : IsProperMap f) (hq : ConnectedSpace Q) : IsCoveringMap f := by sorry`
  Natural language: For arbitrary topological spaces P and Q, if f : P → Q is a local homeomorphism (hlocal), proper (hproper), and the target Q is connected (hq), then f is a covering map (IsCoveringMap f). The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is precise using standard Mathlib predicates: IsLocalHomeomorph, IsProperMap, ConnectedSpace, IsCoveringMap.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- Original: ""Every proper local diffeomorphism f : P → Q between manifolds without boundary, with Q connected, is a covering map.""
- Lean: Replaces manifolds without boundary and local diffeomorphism with general topological spaces and local homeomorphism. It keeps the hypotheses ""proper"" and ""connected target"" and concludes ""covering map.""
- A local diffeomorphism between manifolds is in particular a local homeomorphism, and manifolds are topological spaces. Thus the original statement is a special case of the Lean statement. However, the Lean statement is strictly more general: it asserts the claim for arbitrary topological spaces with no manifold assumptions (no smooth structure, no boundary condition, no extra topological niceties). This is more than a slight generalization; it's a significant strengthening in scope.

3) Final check — same or different?
- Differences:
  - Category shift: smooth manifolds without boundary and local diffeomorphisms vs arbitrary topological spaces and local homeomorphisms.
  - Missing manifold-specific assumptions (Hausdorff, second countable, locally Euclidean, boundaryless) in Lean.
  - Conclusion (covering map) is the same notion, but now in the general topological sense.
- All auxiliary terms used are legitimate Mathlib concepts; no vacuous placeholders were introduced.
- Verdict: The Lean statement is a broader topological theorem that implies the natural-language statement but is not an exact translation. It's almost the same in spirit and would imply the original, but it's not a faithful one-to-one translation of the given manifold-specific claim.

- `import Mathlib` imports the mathlib library.
- `universe u` sets a universe level; not mathematically substantive.
- The theorem declaration:
  - `{X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X]` says X is a topological space.
  - `[CompactSpace X]` says X is compact.
  - `[LocallyPathConnected X]` says X is locally path connected.
  - `[LocallySimplyConnected X]` says X is locally simply connected.
  - `(x0 : X)` is a chosen basepoint in X.
  - Conclusion: `IsFinitelyGenerated (AlgebraicTopology.fundamentalGroup X x0)` asserts that the fundamental group π₁(X, x₀) is finitely generated as an abstract group.
  - `by sorry` is an omitted proof; allowed for this auditing task.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The natural language claim: “Every compact, locally simply connected topological space has finitely generated fundamental group.”
- The code asserts: For any compact, locally simply connected topological space X (and additionally assuming locally path connected), and any basepoint x₀ ∈ X, the fundamental group π₁(X, x₀) is finitely generated.
- The inclusion of a basepoint is standard since the fundamental group depends on a basepoint unless one assumes path connectedness; the original statement did not assume path connectedness, so including x₀ is appropriate.
- The extra hypothesis `[LocallyPathConnected X]` is stronger than needed; however, locally simply connected implies locally path connected (simply connected neighborhoods are path connected), so this is a redundant assumption mathematically and does not change the intended content. In practice, it does make the Lean statement slightly more restrictive syntactically (you must provide an instance), but conceptually it matches the original statement.
- The predicate `IsFinitelyGenerated` applied to `fundamentalGroup X x0` expresses exactly that the group is finitely generated.

Step 3: Final comparison.
- Both statements claim: compact + locally simply connected ⇒ finitely generated fundamental group. The Lean code also assumes locally path connectedness, which is a logical consequence of local simple connectedness, so the mathematical content aligns. The basepoint parameterization is appropriate.
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced.

Conclusion: The translation is essentially faithful with a minor, redundant extra hypothesis. Thus it passes.

- `theorem quotient_map_is_locally_isometric_covering {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X] {Γ : Type*} [Group Γ] [MulAction Γ X] (free_action : Prop) (acts_by_isometries : Prop) (orbits_discrete : Prop) : Prop := by sorry`
  - This declares a theorem with parameters: a metric space `X`, a group `Γ` acting on `X` (`[MulAction Γ X]`).
  - It takes three assumptions, each as an arbitrary `Prop`: `free_action`, `acts_by_isometries`, `orbits_discrete`. These are not tied to Mathlib's actual notions (e.g., `IsFreeSMul Γ X`, `IsometricSMul Γ X`, discrete orbits via a suitable topology/metric notion).
  - The conclusion is merely `: Prop`. This means the theorem is declaring an unnamed, arbitrary proposition as its statement, not an implication or a concrete claim. There is no mention of the quotient, covering maps, or local isometries in the type.
  - The body is `sorry`, so there is no proof provided.
Assessment of whether it matches the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: Given a free action by isometries of a group Γ on a metric space X with discrete orbits, prove that the quotient map X → X/Γ is a locally isometric covering map.
- The Lean code does not formalize the hypotheses using Mathlib’s structures. It uses placeholder `Prop` parameters instead of concrete predicates like `IsFreeSMul Γ X` or `IsometricSMul Γ X` or a definition expressing that orbits are discrete.
- Critically, the conclusion is not the intended mathematical statement. It is just a bare `Prop`, not something like “the quotient map is a covering map and locally isometric”. There is no quotient space `X ⧸ Γ`, no topological or metric structure on the quotient, no `CoveringMap`, and no assertion of local isometry.
- Moreover, the declaration is a theorem with type `Prop`, not a proposition about the given data. This is a red flag: it does not even encode an implication from the assumptions to the desired conclusion.
Auxiliary definitions:
- There are no auxiliary definitions, but the assumptions themselves are vacuous placeholders. The theorem body is `sorry`, and the statement itself is vacuous.
Final comparison:
- The two statements are different. The Lean code neither states nor proves the desired claim; it does not mention the quotient map, covering map, or local isometry, and uses placeholders instead of Mathlib concepts. It is not a legitimate translation.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `def I := { t : ℝ // t ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) (1 : ℝ) }` defines the closed unit interval [0,1] as a subtype of ℝ. This matches the path domain in the natural language statement.
- `variable {M : Type*} [TopologicalSpace M]` assumes only a topological space structure on M, not a smooth manifold structure. The original statement requires M to be a smooth manifold.
- `def smooth_map (f : I → M) : Prop := True` is a placeholder: it asserts that every map is smooth (since it is always True). This is a vacuous definition and not the genuine notion of smoothness. It also ignores the need for smooth structures on both domain and target.
- `def homotopic_rel_endpoints (f g : I → M) : Prop := True` is another placeholder: it asserts any two paths are homotopic rel endpoints. Again vacuous and not the real concept.
- `theorem path_homotopic_rel_endpoints_to_smooth (x : I → M) : ∃ y : I → M, smooth_map y ∧ homotopic_rel_endpoints x y := by sorry` claims existence of a path y that is smooth and homotopic rel endpoints to x. Because the predicates are True by definition, the theorem is vacuously true for any x and any y; it does not encode the actual mathematical content.

Assessment of faithfulness:
- The original statement: For a smooth manifold M and a path x : [0,1] → M, there exists a smooth path y homotopic to x relative to the endpoints {0,1}.
- The Lean code does not assume M is a smooth manifold; it assumes only a topological space. It replaces both “smooth path” and “homotopic rel endpoints” by trivially true predicates. Therefore, the core mathematical content (smoothness, homotopy rel endpoints) is not represented.
- The domain I = [0,1] is correctly modeled, but the crucial structures and properties are not.

Final comparison:
- Key discrepancies:
  - Missing smooth manifold structure on M.
  - “Smooth” and “homotopic rel endpoints” are vacuous placeholders (`:= True`).
  - As a result, the theorem states a vacuous existence rather than the intended substantive claim.
- If the placeholders were replaced by the genuine Mathlib notions (and appropriate smooth structures on I and M were provided), the shape of the theorem would match the natural language statement. However, as written, it is not a faithful translation.

Conclusion: Not faithful. It uses vacuous placeholders and omits the smooth manifold structure, so the formal statement does not capture the intended mathematics.

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code
- `variable {X : Type _}`: We work with an arbitrary type X.

- `theorem contractible_connected [TopologicalSpace X] (h : Contractible X) : ConnectedSpace X := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology, if X is Contractible, then X is a connected space.
  Important: In Mathlib, `Contractible X` (without a topology assumption) is the type-theoretic notion: there exists a point x0 such that every point x is equal to x0. This is not the topological notion of contractibility (existence of a homotopy from id to a constant map). The topological notion in Mathlib is usually named something like `ContractibleSpace X`.

- `theorem contractible_homotopy_groups_trivial [Pointed X] (h : Contractible X) (n : ℕ) : IsTrivial (homotopy_group n X) := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any pointed type X, if X is Contractible, then for each natural number n, the n-th homotopy group of X is trivial.
  Again, `Contractible X` here is the type-theoretic notion (singleton up to equality), not the topological contractibility. Also, the theorem as written assumes only `[Pointed X]` and not `[TopologicalSpace X]`, which is suspicious for topological homotopy groups; in Mathlib, homotopy groups of a topological space typically require a `TopologicalSpace` structure. If the code compiles, that would suggest a nonstandard or different notion than the usual topological homotopy groups, further diverging from the intended statement.

Step 2: Compare with the original natural language statement
Original: ""Prove that every contractible space is connected and has trivial homotopy groups.""
- This is about topological contractibility (existence of a null-homotopy for the identity map; equivalently a homotopy equivalence to a point) implying connectedness and vanishing homotopy groups. One typically needs a basepoint to talk about homotopy groups; that part is fine and the code includes `[Pointed X]` for the second statement.
- The code, however, uses `Contractible X`, which in Mathlib denotes type-theoretic contractibility (X is essentially a singleton type). This is a much stronger and different notion than topological contractibility.
- Moreover, the second theorem does not assume a topology on X, which is at odds with the usual definition of topological homotopy groups.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
They are different. The Lean statements assert results for a type-theoretically contractible type (singleton up to equality), not for a topologically contractible space. This is a substantial mismatch with the natural language statement. Additionally, the second theorem omits the topological structure needed for topological homotopy groups, suggesting an even greater divergence from the intended meaning.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `theorem proper_map_iff_compact_fibers_and_closed {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y] {f : X → Y} (hf : Continuous f) :` establishes the setting: X, Y are topological spaces, Y is Hausdorff (T2), f : X → Y is continuous.
- The statement `(∀ (K : Set Y), IsCompact K → IsCompact (f ⁻¹' K)) ↔ ...` says: f is proper in the sense that the preimage of every compact set K in Y is compact in X.
- The right-hand side `((∀ y : Y, IsCompact (f ⁻¹' ({y} : Set Y))) ∧ (∀ (s : Set X), IsClosed s → IsClosed (f '' s)))` unpacks to: (a) every fiber f⁻¹({y}) is compact, and (b) f is a closed map, i.e., for every closed set s in X, the image f '' s is closed in Y.
- The proof is left as `by sorry`, but for our auditing task we only care about the correctness of the statement/translation.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language: Let f : X → Y be continuous with Y Hausdorff. Prove f is proper iff (a) all fibers are compact and (b) f is closed. The code exactly states this equivalence under the same hypotheses: continuity of f and Y Hausdorff, with ""proper"" expressed as preimage of compact is compact, fibers compact as preimages of singletons, and closed map as images of closed sets are closed.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Hypotheses match: Y is Hausdorff ([T2Space Y]) and f is continuous (`hf : Continuous f`).
- Conclusion matches: equivalence between properness (preimage of every compact set is compact) and (compact fibers ∧ closed map). No extraneous or missing conditions.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; everything uses standard Mathlib notions. The use of `IsClosed (f '' s)` directly instead of `IsClosedMap f` is equivalent and acceptable.

Therefore, the Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

- `theorem covering_spaces_of_R {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] (p : ℝ → X) (hp : IsCoveringMap p) (hne : Nonempty X) [ConnectedSpace X] : Nonempty (Homeomorph X ℝ) ∨ Nonempty (Homeomorph X (AddCircle (1 : ℝ))) := by sorry`
  This asserts: For any topological space X and a map p from ℝ to X which is a covering map (`IsCoveringMap p`), assuming X is nonempty and connected, either there exists a homeomorphism X ≃ ℝ or there exists a homeomorphism X ≃ AddCircle 1. Here `AddCircle (1 : ℝ)` is the additive circle ℝ/ℤ, which is homeomorphic to the standard circle S¹.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Prove that the only topological spaces with ℝ as a covering space are ℝ and S¹.""
- The Lean theorem states exactly this classification for spaces that admit a covering map from ℝ, concluding X is homeomorphic to either ℝ or S¹ (encoded as AddCircle 1).
- The extra hypotheses `Nonempty X` and `[ConnectedSpace X]` are harmless: for a standard definition of covering map (`IsCoveringMap` in Mathlib) surjectivity holds, so the image of the connected space ℝ is connected and nonempty. Thus these assumptions follow from the existence of a covering map and do not change the meaning. They are a slight specialization that is logically redundant given `IsCoveringMap p`.
- No auxiliary, vacuous, or placeholder definitions are introduced; `IsCoveringMap`, `Homeomorph`, and `AddCircle` are standard Mathlib notions.

3) Final check: Are the two problems the same?
- Yes. The Lean statement captures exactly the classification: if X has ℝ as a covering space, then X is homeomorphic to ℝ or S¹. The representation of S¹ as `AddCircle 1` is standard. The added connectedness/nonemptiness assumptions are implied by having such a covering map from ℝ and thus do not alter the content.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem is stated for types X and Y with X equipped with a PseudoMetricSpace structure.
- Given a function f : X → Y that is surjective, the statement asserts there exists a PseudoMetricSpace structure on Y such that the topology on Y induced by that pseudometric (via its associated uniform space) coincides with the coinduced (final/quotient) topology TopologicalSpace.coinduced f coming from f.
- In words: If X is pseudometric and f is surjective, then the quotient topology on Y (induced by f) is the topology of some pseudometric on Y.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Original statement: X is a metric space; f : X → Y is surjective; the quotient topology on Y induced by f arises from a metric on Y.
- Lean statement: X is a pseudometric space (more general than metric); f is surjective; the quotient topology on Y is induced by a pseudometric on Y.
- The use of TopologicalSpace.coinduced f indeed represents the quotient/final topology induced by f. The equality with the topology of a (pseudo)metric is exactly the intended “arises from” formulation.

Step 3: Are the two statements the same?
- Differences:
  - Hypothesis: Metric vs pseudometric on X. This is a generalization (weaker assumption) and is acceptable as a slight generalization.
  - Conclusion: Metric vs pseudometric on Y. This is a weakening of the conclusion: the code proves existence of a pseudometric generating the quotient topology, whereas the natural language statement claims a metric. In general, the quotient of a metric space by an arbitrary surjection need not be metrizable (it may fail T1/T2), but it is pseudometrizable. Hence, while the Lean theorem matches the standard correct result, it does not faithfully match the literal natural language claim of a metric.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all terms are standard Mathlib concepts. The presence of `sorry` is acceptable here per instructions since we are only auditing the statement’s faithfulness.

Conclusion: The code states a closely related but strictly weaker conclusion (pseudometric instead of metric). Therefore, it is not a faithful translation of the given statement, although it is very close and the appropriate correct version.

- The theorem `concat_defined_iff : (x 1 = y 0 ∧ y 1 = z 0) ↔ (x 1 = y 0 ∧ y 1 = z 0)` asserts a tautology: the conjunction of endpoint equalities `(x 1 = y 0 ∧ y 1 = z 0)` is logically equivalent to itself. There is no mention of path concatenation, no predicate or definition capturing when a concatenation is defined, and no use of [0,1] as domain or continuity.

2) Does the whole Lean statement faithfully capture the natural language statement?
- The natural language statement: For paths x, y, z : [0,1] → X (i.e., maps on the unit interval, typically continuous), “(x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.” In standard topology, the concatenation x*y is defined when x(1) = y(0); hence both composites are defined exactly when x(1) = y(0) and y(1) = z(0).
- The Lean code does not formalize the notion of path or concatenation being defined. It instead states a trivial logical equivalence `(A ∧ B) ↔ (A ∧ B)` with A and B equalities at 0 and 1 of maps ℝ → X. It neither encodes the definedness of concatenation nor references concatenations at all. It also uses ℝ as the domain rather than [0,1], and does not impose continuity.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Missing key concept: No formalization of concatenation or its definedness.
- Domain mismatch: Uses ℝ → X rather than paths [0,1] → X.
- Continuity/Path structure: Not encoded.
- Statement trivialized: Reduces to A ↔ A, not the intended equivalence between definedness of (x*y)*z and x*(y*z).

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `constant PathConnectedSpace (Z : Type u) : Prop`: Introduces a placeholder predicate meaning “Z is path connected,” but it does not refer to any topological structure. Vacuous.
- `constant T2Space (Z : Type u) : Prop`: Placeholder for “Z is Hausdorff (T2),” again with no topology structure. Vacuous.
- `constant IsCovering (X Y : Type u) (f : X → Y) : Prop`: Placeholder for “f is a covering map.” Vacuous.
- `constant pi1 (Z : Type u) (z0 : Z) : Type u`: Placeholder for the fundamental group as a Type, with no group structure. Vacuous.
- `constant f_map (X Y : Type u) (f : X → Y) (x0 : X) : pi1 X x0 → pi1 Y (f x0)`: Placeholder for the induced homomorphism on fundamental groups. It is just an arbitrary function here. Vacuous.
- `constant quotient_by_image (A B : Type u) (g : B → A) : Type u`: Placeholder for the quotient of A by the image of g. Lacks any group/subgroup structure; purely a made-up Type. Vacuous.
- `constant fiber (X Y : Type u) (y0 : Y) : Type u`: Placeholder for the fiber over y0, but critically it omits dependence on f. So it cannot represent the fiber of f at y0. Serious mismatch.
- `constant Bijective (α β : Type u) (g : α → β) : Prop`: Placeholder for bijectivity; not Mathlib’s Function.Bijective. Vacuous.
- The theorem:
  `theorem pi1_quotient_bijects_fiber ... : ∃ (φ : quotient_by_image (pi1 Y (f x0)) (pi1 X x0) (f_map X Y f x0) → fiber X Y (f x0)), Bijective ... φ := by sorry`
  Informally: Under assumptions that X and Y satisfy the placeholder path-connected and T2 predicates, and that f is a placeholder covering, there exists some function φ from the quotient_by_image of pi1(Y, f x0) by the image of f_map to the (placeholder) fiber over f x0, which is (placeholder) bijective. The proof is omitted.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
- The natural statement: For path-connected Hausdorff topological spaces X, Y and a covering map f: X → Y with y0 = f(x0), the specific canonical map from π1(Y, y0)/f_*(π1(X, x0)) to the fiber X_{y0} is bijective.
- Mismatches:
  1) All key notions (path connectedness, Hausdorff, covering map, fundamental group, induced map, quotient by subgroup, fiber, and bijective) are declared as bare constants with no connection to Mathlib definitions. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must not be vacuous placeholders.
  2) The fiber is defined as `fiber X Y y0` and does not depend on f. This is fundamentally incorrect; the fiber should be `{x : X | f x = y0}` which depends on f.
  3) The theorem asserts existence of some bijection `∃ φ`, not that the specific canonical map (constructed via path-lifting) is bijective. The natural language states “the map … is bijective,” not merely “there exists a bijection between these sets.” Thus the Lean statement is strictly weaker.
  4) There is no topological structure `[TopologicalSpace X]` or `[TopologicalSpace Y]`; the predicates do not reflect actual topology. This further divorces the statement from the intended content.
  5) The quotient of π1(Y, y0) by the image of f_* should be a quotient of a group by a subgroup; here it is a generic Type constructed from arbitrary Types and a function, losing the algebraic meaning.

Step 3: Final check: same or different?
- Different. The code uses vacuous placeholders for all the key mathematical objects, does not tie the fiber to f, and proves only existence of some bijection rather than bijectivity of the canonical map. Hence it is not a faithful formalization of the stated theorem.

Given multiple severe issues (vacuous placeholders, missing dependence of fiber on f, and the existential vs canonical map mismatch), the translation is not faithful.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `def MySmoothMap (P Q : Type u) := P → Q`: This defines a ""smooth map"" as just an arbitrary function from P to Q. There are no manifold structures, no smoothness assumptions.
- `def MyIsLocalDiffeomorphism {P Q : Type u} (f : MySmoothMap P Q) (p : P) : Prop := True`: The predicate that f is a local diffeomorphism at p is defined to always be True. This is a vacuous placeholder.
- `def MyDense {α : Type u} (s : Set α) : Prop := True`: The predicate that a set is dense is defined to always be True. Another vacuous placeholder.
- The theorem:
  `theorem benmckay_top_fundamental_groups_214 {P Q : Type u} (φ : MySmoothMap P Q)
  (dim_eq : True) : ∃ S : Set P, (∀ p ∈ S, MyIsLocalDiffeomorphism φ p) ∧ MyDense (S : Set P) := by sorry`
  Interpreted: For any types P, Q and any function φ : P → Q, assuming `True` (a placeholder for dim P = dim Q), there exists a set S ⊆ P such that (i) for all p in S, `True` holds (i.e., φ is a ""local diffeomorphism"" at p by the placeholder), and (ii) `True` holds (i.e., S is ""dense"" by the placeholder). This statement is vacuous because both the conclusion predicates are always True. Also, there is no structure of manifolds nor smoothness present.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Original: Let φ: P → Q be a smooth map between manifolds with dim P = dim Q. Show there is a dense set of points p0 ∈ P such that φ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of each such p0.

Discrepancies:
- No manifold structures on P, Q in the code. They are arbitrary types.
- No smoothness assumption. `MySmoothMap` is just a function.
- Dimension hypothesis is replaced by `dim_eq : True`, not an actual equality `dim P = dim Q`.
- The notion of local diffeomorphism is a placeholder that is always True.
- The notion of density is a placeholder that is always True.

Step 3: Are the two problems the same?
No. The Lean statement is entirely vacuous because of the always-True predicates and lack of manifold/smoothness/dimension structure. Even if the proof were provided, it would not reflect the intended mathematical content. However, if the placeholders were replaced with the correct Mathlib notions (smooth manifolds with corners, smooth maps, equality of real dimensions, genuine local diffeomorphism at points, and dense subsets), the shape of the final theorem statement would match the intended claim: existence of a dense set S where φ is a local diffeomorphism at each p ∈ S. Thus it ""aims"" in the right direction but is not faithful as written.

Conclusion: Fails due to vacuous placeholders for all key concepts (smooth map, local diffeomorphism, density, dimension equality) and absence of manifold structure.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `structure CoveringSpace (X Y : Type) where to_fun : X -> Y`
  This defines a structure with just a function X → Y. It does not include any topological structure nor the covering map property. The natural language statement is about covering maps between topological spaces.

- `variable {X Y : Type} (p : CoveringSpace X Y)`
  Introduces a variable p of this structure. Still no topology.

- `def evenly_covered (p : CoveringSpace X Y) (U : Set Y) : Prop := True`
  Defines ""evenly_covered"" as always true. This is a vacuous placeholder, not the actual mathematical notion of an evenly covered open set.

- `noncomputable def sheet_card (p : CoveringSpace X Y) (y : Y) : Nat := 0`
  Defines the “number of sheets” at y to be 0 for all y. This is a vacuous placeholder and also only allows a Nat (no possibility of ∞), contrary to the statement which allows possibly infinite.

- `theorem covering_sheets_constant_along_path ... (γ : Unit -> Y) (t : Unit) : sheet_card p (γ t) = sheet_card p (γ Unit.unit) := by sorry`
  This claims the number of sheets is constant along a “path” γ whose domain is `Unit`. This is not a path in the topological sense (normally a continuous map from [0,1] or a path space). Moreover, because `sheet_card` is identically 0 by definition, this statement would be trivially true even without any hypotheses. It also assumes `evenly_covered p U` but since that is `True`, it carries no content.

- `theorem covering_sheets_constant_on_path_connected ... (path_connected : Prop) : ∀ y y' : Y, sheet_card p y = sheet_card p y' := by ...`
  This asserts that if there is some arbitrary proposition `path_connected`, then the sheet count is constant over all points y,y'. There is no topological structure or actual path connectedness used; `path_connected` is an unused bare `Prop`. Again, since `sheet_card` is constantly 0, the conclusion is trivially true and unrelated to the intended meaning.

Faithfulness assessment:
- The code does not define topological spaces, covering maps, evenly covered open sets, or the number of sheets correctly. All auxiliary definitions are vacuous placeholders (`True`, constant `0`).
- The notion of path is incorrect (`Unit → Y` instead of a continuous path from an interval), and there is no continuity or topology anywhere.
- The second theorem uses a meaningless `Prop` in place of actual path connectedness.
- The target statement allows infinite number of sheets; the code fixes it to Nat=0.

Therefore the formalization is not a legitimate or faithful translation. Even if one replaced the vacuous definitions with proper ones, the theorem statements are still wrong: the “path” type is wrong, and the dependence on evenly covered open sets along a path is missing. Hence it fits the rubric case: makes up vacuous definitions and even if they were fixed, the final statements would not be faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib.Topology.Basic` and `open Set`: Bring in topology basics and set notation.
- The theorem statement: For any type `X` with a topology and any subset `A : Set X`, `frontier A = closure A ∩ closure (X \ A)`. Here, `frontier` is the boundary (also known as the frontier), `closure` is the topological closure, and `X \ A` denotes the set-theoretic difference of `X` by `A`, i.e., the complement of `A` in `X` (which in Lean is commonly written as `Aᶜ` or `univ \ A`). Thus the statement asserts: boundary(A) equals closure(A) ∩ closure(complement of A).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: For a topological space X and subset A, the boundary of A equals the intersection of the closures of A and of X − A, i.e., ∂A = \overline{A} ∩ \overline{X − A}. This matches exactly the Lean theorem: frontier A = closure A ∩ closure (X \ A). The symbols align: frontier = boundary, closure = closure, and X − A = complement of A in X.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions are introduced.
- The formal statement precisely matches the natural language claim with standard mathlib notions.
- There are no scope/quantifier mismatches; the theorem is universally quantified over X (with a topology) and A ⊆ X, exactly as in the natural language.
- Slight notational detail: Lean typically uses `Aᶜ` or `univ \ A` for the complement; but `X \ A` reflects the natural language's `X − A`. Under the assumption the code compiles, this is just a notational choice and faithful.

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

",10,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code
- `variables {X : Type _} [MetricSpace X] {Γ : Type _} [Group Γ] [MulAction Γ X]`: We have a metric space X, a group Γ, and a (left) action of Γ on X.
- Hypothesis `h_isom : ∀ γ : Γ, ∀ x y : X, dist (γ • x) (γ • y) = dist x y`: The action is by isometries (each γ acts as an isometry of X).
- Theorem statement (left side of ↔): `(∀ x : X, ∃ U : Set X, IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ ∀ γ : Γ, γ ≠ 1 → (γ • U) ∩ U = ∅)`
  This says: For every x, there exists an open neighborhood U of x such that for all nontrivial γ, the translate γ • U is disjoint from U. This is the usual local disjointness (properly discontinuous) condition used to define a covering action; in particular, since γ•U ∩ U = ∅ for all γ ≠ 1, the action is automatically free.
- Theorem statement (right side of ↔): `((∀ γ : Γ, γ ≠ 1 → ∀ x : X, γ • x ≠ x) ∧ (∀ x : X, ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧ ∀ γ : Γ, dist (γ • x) x < r → γ = 1))`
  This is: the action is free (no nontrivial element fixes any point) and orbits are discrete. The “discrete orbits” part is expressed metrically: for each x there is r > 0 such that the only orbit point inside the open r-ball around x is x itself (i.e., if γ•x is within r of x, then γ = 1). For isometric actions, this is the standard metric characterization of the orbit being a discrete subset.
- The theorem concludes an equivalence between the “covering action” condition (as above) and “free with discrete orbits,” under the isometric action hypothesis. The proof is omitted (by sorry), which is allowed for this auditing task.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
Natural language: “Suppose X is a metric space and Γ acts on X by isometries. Prove that Γ acts on X as a covering action iff the action is free with discrete orbits.”
- Metric space and isometric action: captured by `[MetricSpace X]` and the hypothesis `h_isom`.
- “Acts as a covering action”: formalized as the existence, for each x, of an open set U containing x such that γ•U is disjoint from U for all γ ≠ 1. For actions by isometries (hence homeomorphisms), this is the standard local criterion for a covering action (equivalently: properly discontinuous and free, and the quotient map is a covering). The disjointness with U for all nontrivial γ implies pairwise disjoint translates as well (since if (γ₁•U) ∩ (γ₂•U) ≠ ∅, then U ∩ ((γ₁⁻¹γ₂)•U) ≠ ∅ with γ₁⁻¹γ₂ ≠ 1), matching the usual formulation.
- “Free with discrete orbits”: the RHS exactly encodes freeness and a metric characterization of discreteness of orbits. Quantification is over all x, so it applies to every orbit point.
- No auxiliary vacuous definitions are introduced; all notions used are standard Mathlib concepts (MetricSpace, Group, MulAction, IsOpen, Set operations, dist). The isometry condition is stated explicitly as an equality of distances.

Step 3: Final check for differences
- The formal “covering action” condition is the standard local disjointness of translates, which in the presence of isometries is equivalent to being a covering action; it also immediately implies freeness. This aligns with the intended meaning in the statement.
- The discrete orbits condition is correctly expressed metrically and universally quantified over all points.
- The theorem is stated as an equivalence under the isometric action hypothesis, exactly matching the natural language claim.
- No extraneous or missing conditions relevant to the equivalence are present.

Conclusion: The Lean statement faithfully formalizes the natural language statement. No vacuity, no misleading auxiliary definitions, and the notions match standard usage. Hence it passes.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `variable {M N : Type*}` and `[TopologicalSpace M] [TopologicalSpace N]`: We have two types M and N equipped with topological space structures.
- `variable (SmoothManifoldM : Prop) (SmoothManifoldN : Prop)`: Introduces placeholder propositions meant to represent “M is a smooth manifold” and “N is a smooth manifold.” They are arbitrary Props, not the actual Mathlib structures for smooth manifolds.
- `variable (IsSmooth : (M → N) → Prop)`: Introduces a placeholder predicate on functions M → N intended to represent “is a smooth map,” but with no connection to any manifold structure.

  Natural language reading: Given a continuous function f : M → N, if (placeholder) SmoothManifoldM and (placeholder) SmoothManifoldN hold, then there exists g : M → N such that (placeholder) IsSmooth g and (placeholder) Homotopic f g. There is no connection enforced between these placeholders and real manifold/smoothness/homotopy notions.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The original statement: “Let M and N be smooth manifolds and let f ∈ C^0(M,N). Show that f is homotopic to a smooth map M → N.”
- The Lean code tries to mimic this by assuming topological spaces and a continuous f, plus two assumptions intended to mean “M and N are smooth manifolds,” and then asserting existence of g that is smooth and homotopic to f.
- However, the key notions (smooth manifold structure on M, N; smoothness of g; homotopy between f and g) are all represented by arbitrary, uninterpreted placeholders (Props/predicates) not tied to Mathlib’s manifold and homotopy theories. There is no guarantee that these placeholders actually mean what they are supposed to mean. This violates the guideline that auxiliary definitions must faithfully describe what they are trying to say.
- Additionally, Mathlib already has manifold and smoothness notions; the code does not use them, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The formal statement is about arbitrary predicates SmoothManifoldM, SmoothManifoldN, IsSmooth, and Homotopic, with no relationship to the intended mathematical structures. If these placeholders were replaced by the genuine Mathlib notions, the shape of the theorem would match the natural language claim. But as written, it is not a legitimate, faithful translation because the core concepts are vacuous placeholders.

Given the above, this is not a faithful translation. If the placeholders were replaced by real Mathlib definitions, the theorem statement would be faithful; hence a mid-range grade is appropriate.

Step 1: Translate each line of the Lean code into natural language.
- The theorem pi1_acts_on_fiber_continuously is stated in a very general setting:
  - X and Y are topological spaces.
  - p : X → Y is a map equipped with the hypothesis hp : IsCoveringMap p (so p is a covering map).
  - y0 : Y is a chosen point; the fibre over y0 is { x : X // p x = y0 } (a subtype).
  - pi1 is an arbitrary type with a Group structure and a TopologicalSpace structure.
  - act is an arbitrary function pi1 → {x // p x = y0} → {x // p x = y0} (intended as an action, but not required to satisfy action axioms or be constructed from topology or paths).
  - hpath_connected : Prop and hlocally_simply_connected : Prop are bare propositions, serving only as placeholders; they do not assert that Y is path connected or locally simply connected.
  - Conclusion: the map (g, x) ↦ act g x from pi1 × {x // p x = y0} to the fibre is Continuous.
  - Proof is omitted via sorry.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement.
- The original statement: The fundamental group π1(X, x0) acts on the fibre X_{x0} = p^{-1}(x0) for every covering space p : X → Y of a path connected and locally simply connected topological space Y, by [x][y] = [x*y], and this action is continuous.
- Discrepancies:
  - The code uses an arbitrary group pi1, not the fundamental group. There is no construction of π1, no relation to X or Y, and no basepoint conditions ensuring the group is indeed π1.
  - The action act is taken as arbitrary input; the code does not construct it (e.g., via path lifting or concatenation [x*y]), nor does it enforce group action axioms.
  - The continuity of the action is asserted outright for any given act, without hypotheses ensuring continuity (e.g., discrete fibre) and without using the covering map structure to deduce it.
  - The placeholders hpath_connected and hlocally_simply_connected are mere Props, not actual hypotheses like PathConnected Y or LocallySimplyConnected Y, and they are unused.
  - The statement in the code proves continuity of a given function; the natural language claims existence and specific form of the action ([x][y] = [x*y]) and then its continuity.
  - Notational mismatch: in standard covering space theory, it is π1(Y, y0) that acts on the fibre over y0. The natural language statement mentions π1(X, x0) acting on X_{x0} = p^{-1}(x0), which itself seems inconsistent; regardless, the code avoids specifying which fundamental group is acting and uses an arbitrary group.

Step 3: Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- No. The Lean theorem neither constructs nor specifies the canonical action of the fundamental group; it does not tie the group to X or Y, does not use the path connected and locally simply connected hypotheses, and asserts continuity for an arbitrary function. It therefore fails to faithfully translate the original statement.

Grade rationale:
- The code is thematically related (covering map, fibre, an action map, continuity), but it replaces the fundamental group with an arbitrary topological group and the canonical action with an arbitrary function, and it uses placeholder/unutilized hypotheses. This is not a faithful translation.

The hypotheses K compact and f '' K = univ match f(K) = Y. The conclusion IsCompact (univ : Set Y) says Y is compact.

- There are no vacuous or placeholder definitions; QuotientMap is a standard Mathlib concept, and the proof is direct and legitimate.

3) Comparison for differences:

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language claims: If A ⊆ B in a topological space X, then cl(A) ⊆ cl(B). This matches exactly the theorem statement in Lean, using Mathlib's `closure` for topological closure and `⊆` for subset. There are no auxiliary or vacuous definitions.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line
- `import Mathlib`: Uses Mathlib's standard topology and metric space machinery.
- Docstring: States the intent: X and Y are subsets of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces (represented as Fin m → ℝ and Fin n → ℝ), and continuity of f between the subtypes is equivalent to ε-δ continuity as a map between metric subspaces.
- `theorem continuous_subtype_iff_epsilon_delta {m n : Nat} {X : Set (Fin m → ℝ)} {Y : Set (Fin n → ℝ)} (f : (↥X) → (↥Y)) : ...` 
  • Domain and codomain are subtypes X ⊆ ℝ^m and Y ⊆ ℝ^n (modeled as functions from `Fin m`/`Fin n` to ℝ), endowed with the subspace (induced) topology/metric.
  • `Continuous f` is the topological notion of continuity for maps between subtypes.
  • The right-hand side is the ε-δ condition: for every point `x : ↥X` and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all `y : ↥X`, if the ambient distance `dist (y : Fin m → ℝ) (x : Fin m → ℝ) < δ`, then the ambient distance `dist (f y : Fin n → ℝ) (f x : Fin n → ℝ) < ε`.
  • The distances are computed in the ambient spaces via coercions from the subtype to the ambient type. For subtypes, this equals the restricted metric; thus this is precisely ε-δ continuity with respect to the subspace metrics.
  • `by sorry` indicates no proof is provided; this is acceptable for auditing the statement's faithfulness.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the natural language statement
- Natural language: X and Y are subsets of Euclidean spaces with the subspace topologies. A map f : X → Y is continuous (preimages of open sets are open) iff it is ε-δ continuous in the usual sense.
- Lean: X ⊆ (Fin m → ℝ) and Y ⊆ (Fin n → ℝ); subtypes carry the induced topology and metric. `Continuous f` is the standard topological notion (equivalent to preimages of open sets are open). The ε-δ condition is stated for points in X and uses ambient distances, which coincide with subspace distances for subtypes. This matches the ε-δ definition of continuity on subspaces of Euclidean spaces.
- The modeling choice `(Fin m → ℝ)` for ℝ^m is standard. Even if the default metric on `(Fin m → ℝ)` is not explicitly stated as Euclidean L2, in finite dimensions all norms induce the same topology, hence the ε-δ continuity notion agrees with topological continuity; thus the formulation remains faithful to the intended statement about Euclidean spaces.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions are used.
- The quantifiers and coercions correctly reflect ε-δ continuity on the subspace.
- The theorem states an exact equivalence between topological continuity on subspaces and ε-δ continuity, as requested.
- Minor technical nuance: `(Fin m → ℝ)` vs an explicit EuclideanSpace type alias. This does not affect the statement’s meaning for continuity because the induced topologies coincide in finite dimensions; the ε-δ criterion is thus the same. Therefore, this is not a substantive discrepancy.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib.Topology.Basic` brings in basic topology definitions, including closure.
- `open Set` allows using `closure` and subset notation conveniently.
- Comment describes the intended lemma: ""Any set is contained in its closure.""
- `theorem subset_closure {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] (A : Set X) : A ⊆ closure A := by sorry`
  This states: For any type X equipped with a topology and any subset A of X, A is a subset of its closure. The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement is precise.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement says: Given A ⊆ X in a topological space X, prove A ⊆ \overline{A}. The Lean statement exactly asserts `A ⊆ closure A` for any topological space X and subset A, which is precisely the same content.

3) Final check for discrepancies:
- Scope: Both handle an arbitrary topological space X and subset A.
- Statement: Identical (A is contained in its closure).
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced. The use of `sorry` is acceptable for translation auditing, as we are checking the statement, not the proof.
Therefore, the translation is faithful.

2) Assessment of faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The natural language statement concerns an invertible matrix A on R^n with eigenvalues both greater than 1 and less than -1, and asks to prove that A: R^n → R^n is a covering map. This involves linear algebra (invertibility, eigenvalues), topology (covering maps), and a nontrivial theorem tying them together.

The provided Lean code does not mention matrices, eigenvalues, linear maps, R^n, covering maps, or any related structures. It only provides a trivial proof of `True`. There are no auxiliary definitions attempting to encode the problem. Thus, it is completely unrelated to the stated theorem.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
No. The Lean code proves a tautology `True`; the original statement is a specific topological claim about a linear map with spectral conditions being a covering map. They are entirely different, with the Lean code providing no translation or even a placeholder for the intended theorem.

Given the guidelines, the code is vacuous and unrelated, so it fails the translation test.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {Γ : Type _} [Group Γ]` and `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [MetricSpace X] [MulAction Γ X]` set up a group Γ acting on a metric space X (with an explicit topological space structure and a group action).
- `def gamma_invariant_open_separation : Prop := ∀ x y : X, ∃ (U V : Set X), IsOpen U ∧ IsOpen V ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V ∧ Disjoint U V ∧ (∀ g : Γ, Set.image (fun z => g • z) U = U) ∧ (∀ g : Γ, Set.image (fun z => g • z) V = V)` defines the property: for any two points x, y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U, V containing x and y respectively, each invariant under the Γ-action in the sense g • U = U and g • V = V for all g. This is a faithful formalization of “Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets.”
- `theorem any_two_points_lie_in_disjoint_Gamma_invariant_open_sets (h_isometric : ∀ g : Γ, ∀ x y : X, dist (g • x) (g • y) = dist x y) : gamma_invariant_open_separation := by sorry` states (without proof) that if each group element acts by an isometry (distance-preserving), then the above property holds.

Comparison with the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement situates this condition within an equivalence of several conditions: “Prove that the following condition is equivalent to the others: Any two points of X lie in disjoint Γ-invariant open sets.” It does not assert that this condition holds merely from the assumption that Γ acts by isometries. 
- The Lean code does two things: (1) it correctly defines the condition as a standalone predicate; (2) it asserts a theorem that from the isometry assumption, the condition holds. This second part is not what the natural language asks; it is a different and generally false statement, and in any case it does not express any equivalence with other conditions.
- There is no attempt in the code to set up or prove equivalence with other conditions; the “others” are absent. Hence the code does not translate the “equivalence” request. It instead claims implication from isometries to the condition.

Auxiliary definitions check:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions; `gamma_invariant_open_separation` is meaningful and accurate. The theorem uses `sorry`, but the task allows omitted proofs; what matters is whether the statement matches the intended math, which it does not in the equivalence aspect.

Final judgment:
- While the definition faithfully captures the condition itself, the overall code does not faithfully translate the natural language goal (equivalence among conditions). It instead asserts an implication that is not asked for and likely untrue in general. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

  Statement: If p : X → Y and q : Z → Y are (assumed) universal coverings (as per the placeholder predicate), then there exists a unique function f : X → Z such that q ∘ f = p. No continuity or homeomorphism structure is required; f is a plain function. The proof is omitted, but our task is only to assess the faithfulness of the statement, not the proof.

2) Comparison with the natural language statement:
- Natural language: ""Suppose that X → Y and Z → Y are universal covering maps. Prove that X is isomorphic to Z as a covering of Y, i.e. there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle X → Y and Z → Y commute.""
- The code mirrors the final rephrasing ""i.e. there is a unique map X → Z making the triangle commute"" via `∃! f, q ∘ f = p`.
- However, there are serious discrepancies:
  - The predicate `is_universal_covering` is defined as `True`, i.e., completely vacuous. This violates the requirement that auxiliary definitions be faithful and non-vacuous.
  - The morphism in the statement is a plain function `X → Z`, not a continuous map, and certainly not a covering isomorphism (homeomorphism over Y). The natural language says ""isomorphic as a covering"", which in standard usage means a homeomorphism over Y. The code drops all topological/continuity/homeomorphism structure.

3) Final check: Are the two math problems the same?
- Even taking the user's ""i.e."" at face value, the code still replaces the notion of universal covering by a vacuous predicate. Therefore, the statement is not a faithful formalization.
- Moreover, the code does not require continuity or isomorphism (homeomorphism) data, so even with a correct predicate, the statement would remain weaker than ""isomorphic as coverings of Y"" unless the intended meaning of ""map"" is merely a function, which is atypical in topology.

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful due to a vacuous auxiliary definition and missing essential topological structure for the morphism. According to the rubric, this warrants a low score; even if the vacuous definition were fixed, the statement would still be too weak (function vs continuous/homeomorphism), so it fits the ""makes up vacuous definitions and even if fixed, the final theorem/definition would not be faithful"" category.

",6,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `import Mathlib`: Imports the math library; fine.
- The theorem `shortest_path_is_polygonal_when_exists` has parameters:
  - `{n : Nat}`: a natural number dimension.
  - `{S : Set (Fin n → ℝ)}`: a subset S of ℝ^n, with ℝ^n modeled as functions `Fin n → ℝ`.
  - `{x y : Fin n → ℝ}`: points x, y in ℝ^n.
  - `(γ : ℝ → Fin n → ℝ)`: a curve from ℝ to ℝ^n.
  - `(is_shortest : Prop)`: an arbitrary proposition intended to stand for “γ is a shortest path (from x to y in ℝ^n \ S)”. But here it is just an unconstrained Prop.
  - `(is_polygonal_with_corners_on_S : Prop)`: an arbitrary proposition intended to stand for “γ is polygonal with corners on S”. Again, just an unconstrained Prop.
- Statement: `is_shortest → is_polygonal_with_corners_on_S` with `by sorry` (proof omitted). This asserts that if the arbitrary proposition `is_shortest` holds, then the arbitrary proposition `is_polygonal_with_corners_on_S` holds. There is no linkage to S, x, y, γ, or the geometry.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural statement: Given S ⊂ ℝ^n and points x, y, the shortest path from x to y in ℝ^n \ S is a polygon with corners on S (whenever such a shortest path exists). A faithful formalization would need:
- A definition of the class of admissible paths: maps with endpoints x, y, lying in ℝ^n \ S.
- A notion of length and of being shortest among admissible paths.
- A notion of being polygonal with corners on S.
- Then a theorem: if γ is an admissible shortest path, then γ is polygonal with corners on S.

The provided Lean code does not define any of these notions. Instead, it introduces two totally arbitrary propositions `is_shortest` and `is_polygonal_with_corners_on_S` with no connection to the path, endpoints, or set S. The statement `is_shortest → is_polygonal_with_corners_on_S` is therefore vacuous and could be asserting anything depending on how those Props are instantiated; it conveys none of the intended geometric content.

Step 3: Final check — are they the same?
No. The Lean code is not a faithful translation. It uses vacuous placeholders for the crucial notions and does not encode any of the constraints (path in ℝ^n \ S, endpoints x and y, existence conditions, polygonal structure with corners on S). Even if the general shape ""if γ is shortest then γ is polygonal"" could match the intended theorem after replacing the placeholders with proper definitions, as written it is entirely unconstrained. Thus it fails the faithfulness requirement.

Grade rationale:
- Vacuous placeholders for key definitions (is_shortest, is_polygonal_with_corners_on_S).
- The theorem statement is too generic and does not capture the mathematical content.
- If those placeholders were replaced with proper definitions, the overall shape could match the intended theorem, so this is not completely unrelated. This corresponds to a grade around 6 per the rubric.

  This asserts: given an arbitrary proposition h_final (unused), Y is Hausdorff if and only if the canonical map P : Σ i, X i → Y is injective. No assumption in the lemma ties the topology on Y to being the final topology with respect to the family f; `h_final : Prop` is merely an unused placeholder.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural language assumption is crucial: the topology on Y is the final topology with respect to the maps f_i: X_i → Y. Under that assumption, we must prove Y is Hausdorff iff there exists a space X and a map P: X → Y that includes all the f_i, and P is injective. The canonical choice X = Σ i, X_i and P as defined suffices to witness the existential quantifier in the statement.
- The Lean code correctly defines the canonical P from the disjoint union and asks for T2Space Y ↔ Injective P, which would be a valid specialization of the “there exists X, P” formulation. However, the code does not assume or enforce that the topology on Y is the final topology for f. Instead, it introduces `h_final : Prop` as a completely generic and unused proposition. Thus, the lemma as stated is claiming the equivalence for an arbitrary topological space Y (with no relation to f) — which is not faithful to the intended statement.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The essential hypothesis “Y has the final topology induced by the family f_i” is missing. The presence of `h_final : Prop` is a vacuous placeholder and not tied to Mathlib’s notion of final topology (e.g., a coinduced structure or an explicit equality of topological structures). The rest (using Σ i, X i as the witness space and P as the canonical map) is acceptable as a specialization of the existential quantifier, but the missing core assumption makes the statement not faithful.
- No other auxiliary definitions are vacuous except that `h_final` is a non-informative placeholder, which triggers the guideline against vacuous placeholders.

Conclusion: Not faithful. If `h_final` were replaced by a legitimate assumption that the topology on Y is the final topology with respect to f (and used accordingly), the statement would then be a faithful formalization. As is, it fails.

  • Proof is omitted by sorry, but we are only auditing translation.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural statement: Y is Hausdorff and admits a universal cover. A based covering p : (X,x0) → (Y,y0) is universal iff for every based covering q : (Z,z0) → (Y,y0) there exists a unique based morphism h : (X,x0) → (Z,z0).
- Faithful requirements:
  • p must be a covering map (based), and universality should be defined in terms of the universal property among coverings over Y.
  • Quantification is over covering maps q (based), not arbitrary maps.
  • The basepoint conditions should be included (they are for q', but not for p in the theorem statement).
  • The existence of a universal cover for Y is context; one could state the equivalence without it, but at least the code should not weaken/strengthen the universal property.
- The code fails on several counts:
  • Universality is a placeholder Prop with no link to the universal property.
  • The quantification over q' does not restrict to covering maps; it’s for all maps q' with any arbitrary Prop is_covering_q'. This is much stronger than intended and not faithful.
  • The fact that p is a covering map and the basedness p x0 = y0 are omitted from the theorem statement.
  • The assumption that Y admits a universal cover is not encoded; while not strictly necessary for the logical equivalence, the rest already fails.

Step 3: Final check — are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is an abstract equivalence between an arbitrary Prop is_universal_p and a very strong uniqueness property for all maps q' (not just coverings), with no requirement that p is a covering map or based. It neither uses nor encodes genuine covering map notions from Mathlib. It also introduces vacuous placeholders and unused parameters. Therefore, it is not a faithful formalization of the given natural language statement.

Summary of discrepancies:
- Uses vacuous placeholders for covering and universality.
- Does not restrict to covering maps in the universal property; instead quantifies over all maps.
- Does not assert p is a covering map or enforce its basedness in the theorem.
- Ignores the “Y admits a universal covering” contextual premise.

Given these issues, the translation fails.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem compact_quotient_of_compact_image {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] (f : X → Y) (K : Set X) (hK : IsCompact K) (hKsurj : f '' K = (Set.univ : Set Y)) : @IsCompact Y (TopologicalSpace.coinduced f) (Set.univ : Set Y) := by sorry`
  • X and Y are types; X has a topology.  
  • f : X → Y is any map.  
  • K ⊆ X is a set.  
  • hK asserts K is compact (as a subset of X).  
  • hKsurj asserts f''K = univ, i.e., the image of K under f is all of Y.  
  • Conclusion: Y, equipped with the coinduced (quotient) topology from f, has IsCompact univ, i.e., the whole space Y is compact.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- Natural language: Let f be surjective and assume there exists a compact K ⊆ X with f(K) = Y. Equip Y with the quotient topology induced by f. Prove Y is compact.  
- Lean: Assumes K is compact and f''K = univ; this already implies f is surjective. The topology on Y is explicitly the coinduced (quotient) topology. The conclusion is precisely that Y is compact (formulated as IsCompact univ). This matches the statement.

3) Final check / differences:
- The Lean statement does not separately assume surjectivity, but it includes f''K = univ, which implies surjectivity. This is a harmless redundancy removal and fully faithful.  
- Using IsCompact univ instead of a CompactSpace instance is a standard equivalent formulation.  
- No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the statement uses standard Mathlib notions (IsCompact, coinduced, image).  

Conclusion: The translation is faithful.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code line by line.
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set Filter Topology`: Bring in Mathlib and open common namespaces; these are just setup.
- The theorem declaration: `theorem closure_union_ext (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (A B : Set X) : closure (A ∪ B) = closure A ∪ closure B := by sorry`
  Natural language: For any type X equipped with a topology (i.e., a topological space), and for any subsets A and B of X, the closure of A ∪ B equals the union of the closures of A and B. The `by sorry` indicates the proof is omitted, but the statement itself is clear.

Step 2: Assess faithfulness to the original statement.
- Original: “Let X be a topological space. Prove that cl(A ∪ B) = cl(A) ∪ cl(B) for all subsets A, B ⊆ X.”
- Lean: Exactly states closure (A ∪ B) = closure A ∪ closure B under [TopologicalSpace X], with A, B : Set X. Matches precisely.

Step 3: Final check comparing the two statements.
- Domains align: X is a topological space, A, B are subsets of X.
- Claim aligns: equality of closures as stated.
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions; no hidden generalization or restriction. The only omission is the proof (`sorry`), which is acceptable per the auditing task focused on translation.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

  `theorem covering_comp (hp : CoveringSpace.IsCovering p) (hq : CoveringSpace.IsCovering q) : CoveringSpace.IsCovering (q ∘ p) := by sorry`
  This states: assuming p and q are covering maps (expressed by the Mathlib predicate `CoveringSpace.IsCovering` on functions), then their composition `q ∘ p : X → Z` is also a covering map.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
The natural language statement says: If X → Y and Y → Z are covering maps, then the composition X → Z is also a covering map. The Lean theorem states exactly the same: given `hp : CoveringSpace.IsCovering p` and `hq : CoveringSpace.IsCovering q`, deduce `CoveringSpace.IsCovering (q ∘ p)`. No extra hypotheses or restrictions are introduced; the contexts match (topological spaces on X, Y, Z; p and q as functions). The predicate `CoveringSpace.IsCovering` is the Mathlib notion of a covering map. Thus the formal statement is a faithful translation.

3) Final check and differences:
- No auxiliary/vacuous definitions are introduced; everything uses Mathlib's standard notions.
- The proof is omitted (`sorry`), but our task is to audit the translation of the statement, not its proof.
- There are no added or missing assumptions relative to the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- We fix a topological space X and a map x : ℝ → X which is continuous on the closed interval [0,1] (hx : ContinuousOn x (Icc 0 1)). This matches the idea that x is a path [0,1] → X.
- The theorem asserts the existence of a continuous homotopy H : [0,1] × [0,1] → X, formalized as H : ℝ × ℝ → X together with continuity on the product of closed intervals Icc(0,1) × Icc(0,1).
- Boundary condition at s = 0: For all t ∈ [0,1], H(t,0) = if t ≤ 1/2 then x(2t) else x(2 − 2t). This explicitly encodes the concatenation of x with its reverse: on [0,1/2] we traverse x at double speed, and on [1/2,1] we traverse the reverse path, since x(2 − 2t) = x(1 − (2t − 1)) = x̄(2t − 1).
- Boundary condition at s = 1: For all t ∈ [0,1], H(t,1) = x 0. This says the terminal loop is the constant loop at x(0).
- Relative-to-{0,1} condition: For all s ∈ [0,1], H(0,s) = x 0 and H(1,s) = x 0. This ensures the endpoints are fixed at the basepoint throughout the homotopy, i.e., homotopy relative to {0,1}.
- H is continuous on the square Icc(0,1) × Icc(0,1), matching the standard notion of a continuous homotopy.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement: given a path x : [0,1] → X and its reverse x̄(t) = x(1 − t), the concatenation x * x̄ is homotopic relative to {0,1} to the constant loop at x(0).
- The code expresses exactly this by constructing (via an existence statement) a continuous homotopy H with:
  • H(·,0) realizing the concatenation x * x̄ via the piecewise formulation.
  • H(·,1) being the constant loop at x(0).
  • Endpoint fixation H(0,·) = H(1,·) = x(0), i.e., homotopy relative to {0,1}.
- The use of ContinuousOn on Icc and quantification over t,s ∈ Icc(0,1) matches the topological path setting on the closed interval.

3) Final check for differences:
- Domain: The code uses ℝ with constraints t,s ∈ Icc(0,1), matching [0,1].
- Reverse and concatenation: Implemented explicitly and correctly via x(2t) / x(2 − 2t), which equals x * x̄.
- Relative homotopy: Endpoints fixed at x(0) throughout, which is exactly the requirement since x * x̄ and the constant loop both have endpoints x(0).
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are used; only a theorem statement with an existential quantifier for H.
- No extra or missing conditions compared to the natural statement.

Conclusion: The Lean statement is a faithful formalization of the natural language statement.

- `variable (has_covering_action : Prop)`: an abstract proposition meant to stand for “Γ has a covering action on Y,” but with no linkage to any mathlib definition.
- `variable (Y_simply_connected : Prop)`: an abstract proposition intended to represent “Y is simply connected,” but not tied to mathlib’s actual notion.

  This says: assuming the conjunction of five abstract propositions, we can conclude the conjunction of two other abstract propositions. There is no use of mathlib structures for covering actions, quotients, universal covers, or π1, and no connection that X really is Γ \ Y or that p is the canonical quotient map. Also the proof is a placeholder `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The original statement: If Γ has a covering action on a simply connected, locally simply connected, Hausdorff space Y, then the quotient map p : Y → X = Γ \ Y is a universal covering map and there is an isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ.
- The code does not define or enforce: (i) that Γ acts on Y, (ii) that X is the quotient Γ \ Y, (iii) that p is the quotient map, (iv) that Y is Hausdorff/simply connected/locally simply connected in the mathlib sense, (v) that p is a universal covering map in the mathlib sense, or (vi) that there is an actual group isomorphism π1(X) ≅ Γ (it only has a dummy `Prop`). All core mathematical notions are replaced by unrelated propositional placeholders. Thus the statement is not faithfully encoded.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The Lean theorem is a vacuous implication between arbitrary `Prop`s and does not express any of the actual mathematical content: no action, no quotient construction, no universal covering map, no fundamental group, no isomorphism structure. Even replacing the placeholders with real definitions would require substantial changes (defining the action, forming the quotient X = Γ \ Y, making p the canonical quotient map, using actual covering/universal covering predicates, and stating a genuine isomorphism of groups).

  This declares a theorem with parameters:
  - `X`, `X_phi`, `Y`, `Γ`, `pi1X` are arbitrary types,
  - `Γ` has a group structure,
  - `φ` is an arbitrary function from `pi1X` to `Γ`,
  - `p_phi : X_phi → X` and `pY : Y → X` are arbitrary functions.
  The conclusion is the proposition `True`. The proof is admitted via `sorry`.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
The original statement is a strong classification result about covering spaces: for a path connected, locally simply connected space `X`, a group `Γ`, and a group morphism `φ : π1(X) → Γ` with a `Γ`-action on `X_φ`, the map `p_φ : X_φ → X` is a `Γ`-covering with `Γ ≅ π1(X)`, and any connected `Γ`-covering `Y → X` arises from such a construction for some `φ`.

None of these structures or assertions appear in the Lean statement:
- No topological spaces (`TopologicalSpace` instances) are declared on `X`, `Y`, or `X_phi`.
- No hypotheses of path connectedness or local simple connectivity.
- `pi1X` is just an arbitrary type, not the fundamental group `π1(X)`; there is no group structure on `pi1X` and no mention that `φ` is a group homomorphism.
- No group action of `Γ` on `X_phi`.
- No notion of covering spaces, `Γ`-coverings, or connectedness for `Y → X`.
- No isomorphism `Γ ≅ π1(X)` stated.
- The “theorem” concludes `True`, a vacuous proposition, rather than the intended covering space classification claims.

3) Final check: are the two math problems the same?
They are completely different. The Lean code states a trivial proposition (`True`) with unrelated parameters, providing no formalization of the classification statement. It also uses `sorry` for the proof. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

- `def induced {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (x0 : X) (y0 : Y) (f : X → Y) (h : f x0 = y0) : pi1 X x0 → pi1 Y y0 := fun _ => ()`
  This defines a placeholder for the induced map on fundamental groups by a based map f satisfying f x0 = y0. It ignores the input and returns the unique element of Unit, so it's the constant function from Unit to Unit. This is not the genuine induced homomorphism of fundamental groups.

- `theorem homotopic_maps_induce_same_map ... (f0 f1 : X → Y) (homotopy : Prop) (h0 : f0 x0 = y0) (h1 : f1 x0 = y0) : induced x0 y0 f0 h0 = induced x0 y0 f1 h1 := by sorry`
  This states that given two maps f0, f1 and some proposition `homotopy : Prop` (not tied to f0, f1 in any way) and basepoint equalities h0, h1, the two induced maps are equal. The proof is omitted with `sorry`. Notably:
  - There is no continuity assumption on f0, f1.
  - `homotopy` is just an arbitrary proposition, not a Homotopy between f0 and f1.
  - The statement compares two induced maps between Unit types, which are trivially equal anyway, and does not encode group structure or homomorphism properties.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully reflect the natural language statement?
No. The natural statement: Given a homotopy of continuous maps f_t: X → Y with f0(x0) = f1(x0) = y0, the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups (π1) agree. The code departs in several crucial ways:
- Fundamental group is replaced by the Unit type (vacuous placeholder), losing all group structure and information.
- The induced map is a constant function ignoring the actual map f and not a group homomorphism.
- The hypothesis `homotopy : Prop` does not express that f0 and f1 are homotopic (no data, no continuity, no relation to f0, f1).
- No requirement that f0, f1 are continuous or that the homotopy is continuous or relative to the basepoint.
- The theorem is unproven (`sorry`), which is acceptable per instructions, but the statement itself is not a faithful formalization of the mathematical claim.

3) Final check and differences:
- Uses vacuous placeholder for π1 (Unit) instead of the actual fundamental group (group structure missing).
- Uses a placeholder induced map that is constant and not a homomorphism.
- The ""homotopy"" is an arbitrary proposition, not a homotopy between f0 and f1.
- No continuity assumptions at all.
- The equality of induced maps holds vacuously given the placeholders, unrelated to the homotopy condition.

Therefore, the Lean code is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

",3,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- variable {X : Type u}: Works over an arbitrary type X. No topological structure is assumed, which is already a deviation since the statement is about paths in a topological space.
- structure Path where start : X; finish : X: A ""path"" is encoded only by its endpoints in X. There is no map [0,1] → X, no continuity, no parameterization, and no mention of fixing endpoints at 0 and 1. This is a severe simplification and not faithful to the standard notion of a path.
- def concat_valid (x y : Path) : Prop := x.finish = y.start: Two paths are composable iff the end of x equals the start of y. This is reasonable as a minimal composability condition on endpoints, but since Path itself is reduced to endpoints only, it ignores all actual path data.
- def concat (x y : Path) (_h : concat_valid x y) : Path := { start := x.start, finish := y.finish }: Concatenation produces a new Path with the start of x and the finish of y, requiring a proof that the endpoints match. Given the degenerate Path type, this records only endpoints.
- def homotopic_rel_endpoints (p q : Path) : Prop := p.start = q.start ∧ p.finish = q.finish: This is a vacuous placeholder for “homotopy relative to {0,1}”; it merely asserts that endpoints agree, not that there exists a continuous homotopy keeping endpoints fixed. This is not faithful to the mathematical notion.
- theorem concat_assoc_homotopy ... : homotopic_rel_endpoints (concat (concat x y hxy) z hyz) (concat x (concat y z hyz) hxy): States that the two parenthesizations are homotopic_rel_endpoints. With the placeholder definition, this just says both composites have the same start and finish, which is trivial given how concat is defined. It does not capture the genuine homotopy relative {0,1}.
- theorem concat_defined_iff ... : (concat_valid x y ∧ concat_valid y z) ↔ (concat_valid x y ∧ concat_valid y z): This is a tautology (A ∧ B) ↔ (A ∧ B). It does not actually assert the intended “(x*y)*z is defined iff x*(y*z) is defined.” A faithful formalization would relate the definedness of the two composite concatenations; here, the statement is vacuous and does not mention the composites at all.

Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The original statement requires X to be a topological space and x, y, z to be continuous paths [0,1] → X. The code has no topology and encodes paths as mere endpoint pairs. This is a major mismatch.
- “Homotopic relative to {0,1}” is replaced by “same endpoints,” a vacuous proxy. This does not capture the essence of homotopy.
- The associativity up to homotopy claim in Lean reduces to a trivial endpoint equality, not the actual homotopy result.
- The definedness equivalence is not correctly expressed: the code proves a tautology instead of relating the definedness of (x*y)*z and x*(y*z).
- The code also does not use Mathlib’s existing Path or homotopy notions, which is a red flag per the guidelines.

Final check: The two problems are different. The Lean code uses vacuous/oversimplified auxiliary definitions and fails to state the definedness equivalence properly. Even if the auxiliary definitions were fixed to be faithful, the second theorem’s statement would still be wrong as written. Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:

- `variable (x0 x1 : X)`: Declare two points x0, x1 in X.

- `theorem fundamental_group_isomorphic_via_path : Function.Bijective map ∧ (∀ a b : pi1_0, map (a * b) = map a * map b) := by sorry`: Assert that this arbitrary map is bijective and a group homomorphism.

Assessment:
- The natural language statement is about the fundamental groups π1(X, x0) and π1(X, x1) and the explicit basepoint-change isomorphism induced by a path x from x0 to x1 via y ↦ x⁻¹ * y * x (concatenation with the reverse path and the path). It requires specifying the path, loops, concatenation, reversal, homotopy classes, and showing the induced map is a group isomorphism.
- The Lean code does none of this: it does not define the fundamental groups, does not mention paths, loops, concatenation, or homotopy classes, and treats pi1_0, pi1_1 as arbitrary groups and map as an arbitrary function. The theorem simply asserts that an arbitrary map between arbitrary groups is bijective and multiplicative, which is unrelated to the geometric/topological construction.
- Moreover, the theorem is stated with no hypotheses ensuring bijectivity or homomorphism; it is a naked false claim (filled with `sorry`). Even if the proof were provided, the statement would not reflect the intended construction.
- There are no vacuous auxiliary definitions, but the main statement is entirely detached from the intended content.

Final check:
- The two statements are different in every essential respect: the code does not specify π1, the basepoint-change map, or any topological data beyond X being a topological space. The property proved (bijective homomorphism of an arbitrary function) is not constrained to the context of fundamental groups or to the path-induced map.
- Therefore, this is not a faithful translation.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `import Mathlib`: Uses mathlib.
- The theorem statement
  `theorem R2_homeo_ball (r : ℝ) (hr : 0 < r) : Homeomorph (ℝ × ℝ) ({ x : ℝ × ℝ // x ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℝ × ℝ) r }) := by sorry`
  reads: For any real number r > 0, there is a homeomorphism between ℝ × ℝ and the subtype of points x : ℝ × ℝ such that x lies in the open metric ball of radius r centered at 0 in ℝ × ℝ. In other words, ℝ² is homeomorphic to the open ball of radius r centered at the origin (with respect to the default metric on ℝ × ℝ). The `sorry` indicates the proof is omitted; we are auditing only the statement.

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: “Prove that the Euclidean plane ℝ² is homeomorphic to any open ball in ℝ².”
- The Lean theorem asserts a homeomorphism to an open ball of radius r centered at 0, not an arbitrary center. This is a slight specialization. However, since translation by any center is a homeomorphism, the general statement for any center follows easily from the centered-at-0 case.
- Another subtlety: the Lean code uses the default metric on ℝ × ℝ (the product/sup metric), so `Metric.ball` is a ball for that metric, whereas “Euclidean plane” usually suggests the standard Euclidean (ℓ²) norm. In finite-dimensional spaces, these norms induce the same topology, and the resulting “balls” (though different shapes) are open sets homeomorphic to each other. For the topological statement “homeomorphic to an open ball,” this difference is not substantive for faithfulness to the intended topological content.

3) Final check (same or different?):
- Differences:
  - Center: the code fixes the center at 0, while the natural statement says “any open ball.” This is a mild specialization; composing with translations gives the general result.
  - Metric: the code’s ball is with respect to mathlib’s default metric on ℝ × ℝ (sup norm), not explicitly the Euclidean (ℓ²) norm. Topologically, this is immaterial in finite dimensions, but it is a technical divergence in the exact geometric shape of the “ball.”
- Conclusion: The statement is essentially the same topological claim, with a mild specialization (center = 0) and a harmless metric choice (equivalent norm). There are no vacuous or fake auxiliary definitions.

Given the small discrepancies, this is an “almost the same” translation and acceptable as faithful to the intended statement.

The proof is omitted (`by sorry`).

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The intended statement: For a domain Z ⊂ ℂ and an analytic function g on Z, g admits a logarithm G on Z iff (1) g has no zeros on Z and (2) g sends every loop in Z to a null-homotopic loop in ℂ \ {0}.
- The shape of the theorem matches: existence of a holomorphic G on Z with `g = exp ∘ G` on Z iff the two conditions. The code uses `G : ℂ → ℂ` with restriction to Z, which is a standard formalization strategy and acceptable.
- However, the crucial predicates are all vacuous placeholders (`:= True`), so the assumptions ""Z is a domain"", ""g is holomorphic on Z"", and the loop condition are not genuinely expressed. The loop condition does not actually mention ℂ \ {0} in its formal content; it is only in the comment.
- Moreover, the theorem relies on these placeholders, so the equivalence in the statement is not a faithful formalization of the intended mathematical content.

3) Final comparison and differences:
- Differences:
  - ""Z is a domain"" is not enforced; `is_domain` is always True.
  - ""g is holomorphic on Z"" is not enforced; `holomorphic_on` is always True (and it is not Mathlib’s `HolomorphicOn`).
  - The key loop condition into ℂ \ {0} is not formalized; `maps_loops_to_nullhomotopic` is always True.
  - The theorem’s proof is omitted (`sorry`), but the main issue is the vacuous auxiliary definitions that render the statement non-faithful.
- Conclusion: While the high-level shape of the statement matches the natural language proposition, the use of vacuous placeholders means the formalization is not faithful.

Assessment: Fails faithfulness due to vacuous definitions, though if these predicates were replaced with legitimate Mathlib notions, the structure would be appropriate.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: X, Xtil, I are types equipped with TopologicalSpace structures. So we are in a topological context but no additional structure (like covering maps, homeomorphisms, continuity) is imposed by default.
- The theorem deck_transformation_preserves_lifts takes:
  - p : Xtil → X (intended as the covering map),
  - g : Xtil → Xtil (intended as a deck transformation),
  - hg : p ∘ g = p (this is the condition “g preserves p”),
  - γ : I → X (intended to be a path),
  - γtil : I → Xtil (intended to be a lift of γ),

2) Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural language statement: For any path connected and locally simply connected topological space X, a homeomorphism X~ ≅ X~ that preserves the covering map X~ → X (i.e., a deck transformation) takes any lift of a path to a lift of the same path.
- The Lean statement captures the core content: if g preserves p (p ∘ g = p) and γtil lifts γ (p ∘ γtil = γ), then p ∘ (g ∘ γtil) = γ. This is precisely the algebraic condition that g ∘ γtil is a lift of γ. The result does not actually need the extra hypotheses (path connected, locally simply connected, p being a covering map, or g being a homeomorphism); the equality follows purely from p ∘ g = p.

3) Comparison and differences:
- Dropped assumptions: The Lean statement does not assume X is path connected or locally simply connected, nor that p is a covering map, nor that g is a homeomorphism. These are extraneous for the specific claim being proved (the commuting identity suffices). So the Lean theorem is a generalization but still implies the natural statement when specialized to a genuine deck transformation.
- Path/continuity: The code treats a “path” just as a function γ : I → X, with no continuity assumption and I arbitrary. It also does not assert continuity of g ∘ γtil. In topology, “lift of a path” typically means a continuous path whose composition with p equals γ. The Lean statement focuses only on the compositional equality p ∘ (g ∘ γtil) = γ, which is the essential lifting equation; continuity would follow if g is a homeomorphism and γtil is continuous, but those hypotheses are not stated. This is a mild mismatch in formalization detail, but the core mathematical content (preserving lifts under commuting) is captured exactly.
- No vacuous or fake definitions: The code introduces no placeholder definitions; it states a straightforward equality under a standard commuting hypothesis. There are no suspicious auxiliary definitions.

Conclusion: The Lean code faithfully captures the essential content of the natural statement, with a benign generalization and with topological/continuity aspects implicit rather than formalized. Hence it passes, though not encoding continuity/homeomorphism explicitly prevents a perfect score.

  This sets up a group Γ, a metric space X, and a group action of Γ on X.

- theorem benmckay_top_covering_spaces_271 (h_isometry : ∀ g : Γ, Isometry (fun x : X => g • x)) (h_equiv : Equivalence (fun x y : X => ∃ g : Γ, g • x = y)) : Nonempty (MetricSpace (Quotient (Setoid.mk (fun x y : X => ∃ g : Γ, g • x = y) h_equiv))) := by sorry
  Interpreted: Assume the action is by isometries, and assume the relation x ~ y iff ∃ g, g • x = y is an equivalence (true for group actions, but here taken as a hypothesis). Then there exists at least one metric space structure on the quotient type of X by this relation. No further properties are stated; in particular, the metric is not specified, and there is no statement about the induced topology matching the quotient topology. The proof is omitted (sorry), but the theorem is just a statement of existence.

Comments in the code mention the intended metric d([x],[y]) = Inf (range (fun g => dist (g • x) y)) and that it should induce the quotient topology, but these are only comments and not part of the formal statement.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
The natural language condition asserts:
- The quotient space is a metric space under a specific quotient metric d( x̄, ȳ ) = inf_{g ∈ Γ} d(gx, y);
- The metric topology agrees with the quotient topology;
- It is stated as one of several equivalent conditions (though the equivalence aspect is peripheral to this particular auditing; still, the code does not frame it as an equivalence).

Step 3: Are they the same?
Differences:
- Specific metric: The code does not specify the metric structure at all; it merely asserts existence of some MetricSpace structure. It does not state that the metric equals the “inf over Γ” expression.
- Topology agreement: The code does not assert that the metric topology equals the quotient topology. Since Quotient already carries the quotient topology (from [MetricSpace X] → [TopologicalSpace X] → [TopologicalSpace (Quot ...)]) and any MetricSpace structure on the quotient yields another topology, a crucial part of the statement is missing.
- Equivalence framing: The natural language situates this as one of several equivalent conditions; the Lean theorem is a standalone existence claim.
- Extra hypothesis h_equiv: This is fine as a technical requirement, but it is redundant given a group action; not a problem, just an extra assumption.

No vacuous or fake definitions are introduced; the theorem is a legitimate Lean statement, but it is substantially weaker than the intended one and omits the essential identifications (the explicit metric formula and topology agreement).

Conclusion: The translation is not faithful.

- The long docstring describes (in words) the van Kampen theorem in the form stated by the user, but this is only a comment and has no formal effect.
- `theorem van_kampen_top_covering_spaces_1064 : True := by sorry`: The only formal statement asserts the proposition `True`. It has no hypotheses and no content connected to fundamental groups, open covers, path-connectedness, or amalgamated free products. The proof is `sorry`, but even ignoring that, the statement itself is vacuous because it claims `True`.

2) Does the whole translation faithfully capture the natural language statement?
No. The natural language statement is a precise algebraic-topological theorem: under hypotheses on a path-connected, locally simply connected space X with a path-connected open cover and intersections containing the basepoint, the fundamental group π1(X, x0) is the amalgamated free product of the π1(X_a, x0) along the π1(X_{ab}, x0).

They are completely different. The Lean theorem is the trivial statement `True`, unrelated to the van Kampen theorem. The comment does restate the intended theorem informally, but comments are non-executable. There are no auxiliary definitions (which avoids vacuity there), but the final theorem is vacuous and not a specialization or generalization of the intended statement; it is not the same in any sense.

Given the rubric, this is completely unrelated as a formalization of the claimed result.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Bring in Mathlib and open the `Set` namespace to use set-theoretic notation like ∩, ⊆, closure.
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]`: Fix a type X equipped with a topological space structure.
- `theorem closure_inter_subset_closure_inter_open {A U : Set X} (hU : IsOpen U) : closure (A ∩ U) ⊆ closure A ∩ U := by sorry`:
  For arbitrary subsets A, U of X, assuming U is open, the theorem states that the closure of A ∩ U is contained in the intersection of the closure of A with U. The proof is omitted with `sorry`, but the statement itself is clear.

2) Whole translation faithfulness:
The natural language statement is: For any subset A ⊆ X and open set U ⊆ X, we have cl(A ∩ U) ⊆ cl(A) ∩ U. The Lean theorem states exactly this, with the hypothesis `IsOpen U` and the conclusion `closure (A ∩ U) ⊆ closure A ∩ U`.

3) Final check: same or different?
They are the same. No auxiliary or vacuous definitions are introduced; the code uses standard Mathlib notions (`closure`, `IsOpen`, `⊆`, `∩`). The presence of `sorry` is acceptable per the instruction that no proofs are used. Note: Mathematically, the statement is generally false, but the task is to assess translation fidelity, which is exact here.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {E : Type*} [TopologicalSpace E] [Add E]`: We fix a topological space X and a type E equipped with a topology and an addition operation. Importantly, no assumption is made that the addition on E is continuous.
- `variable {f g : X → E}`: f and g are functions from X to E.
- The theorem `continuous_add (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : Continuous (fun x => f x + g x)` states: if f and g are continuous, then their pointwise sum x ↦ f x + g x is continuous, under only the assumptions [TopologicalSpace E] and [Add E]. There is no proof (sorry), but we are only auditing the statement.

2) Compare with the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: Let X be a topological space and n ∈ ℕ. Suppose f, g : X → ℝ^n are continuous. Then f + g : X → ℝ^n is continuous. Here ℝ^n has its usual topology and addition, and crucially the addition map on ℝ^n is continuous (indeed ℝ^n is a topological additive group).
- Lean statement: A purported generalization to any E with a topology and an addition. However, it does not assume that addition on E is continuous. The claim is thus much stronger and, in general, false: on a topological space E with a discontinuous addition operation, the sum of continuous maps need not be continuous.

3) Final check: same or different?
- Different. The original is a correct statement for E = ℝ^n (where addition is continuous). The Lean theorem claims the result for arbitrary E with only [TopologicalSpace E] and [Add E], which is not sufficient. To be faithful, the Lean code should either specialize to E = ℝ^n (e.g., E = Fin n → ℝ or EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) or assume a structure guaranteeing continuity of addition, such as `[ContinuousAdd E]` (or a `TopologicalAddMonoid`/`TopologicalAddGroup` structure).
- Thus the translation is not faithful because it omits the essential hypothesis that the addition map is continuous.

Suggested fix: Add `[ContinuousAdd E]` (or work in a `TopologicalAddMonoid`/`TopologicalAddGroup`) or specialize to `E := Fin n → ℝ` or `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.

No vacuous definitions were introduced, and the statement direction is conceptually aligned but incorrectly generalized, so this is close but not faithful.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- Variables: X, Y, Z are types with topological spaces.
- def snd_comp (f : ContinuousMap Y Z) : ContinuousMap (X × Y) Z := f ∘ snd. This is the inclusion C(Y, Z) → C(X × Y, Z) by composing with the second projection (x, y) ↦ y.
- Theorem snd_comp_range: The range of snd_comp equals the set of continuous maps g : X × Y → Z that are constant in the X-coordinate for each fixed y, i.e., ∀ x1 x2 y, g (x1, y) = g (x2, y).

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- The statement mentions a dense subset A ⊂ X, but A is never used in the code (nor is it relevant to the map via the second projection). This is a discrepancy: the code ignores the “A dense” hypothesis entirely.
- The statement says: “the inclusion of C(Y) → C(X × Y) is an isomorphism onto the functions which are constant on each set {x} × Y with x ∈ X.” Being constant on {x} × Y means for fixed x and varying y, g(x, y) is constant in y. That corresponds to composing functions from X, not from Y: it characterizes the image of the first projection (C(X, Z) → C(X × Y, Z)), not C(Y, Z) via the second projection.
- The code, on the other hand, proves the image of C(Y, Z) under composition with snd is exactly those maps constant in the X-coordinate (i.e., constant on X × {y} for each y), which is the opposite fiber from the natural language phrase {x} × Y.
- Furthermore, the statement uses the word “isomorphism onto,” which suggests not only characterization of the image but also that the map is a bijection onto that subset. The code only states equality of the range with the subset; it does not state injectivity or provide an explicit inverse (though injectivity holds because snd is surjective). Still, the code as written does not assert the bijection/isomorphism.

3) Final check:
- Major mismatch: The natural language demands constancy on {x} × Y (constant in y), while the Lean code gives constancy on X × {y} (constant in x). These are different conditions.
- The code ignores the dense subset A ⊂ X entirely.
- The code states range equality but does not explicitly present the isomorphism (bijective correspondence) onto that subset.

Conclusion: The Lean code is not a faithful translation of the given natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate the Lean code into natural language.
- Context/instances:
  - G is a type with [Group G], [TopologicalSpace G], and [TopologicalGroup G]. So G is a topological group.
  - X is a type with [TopologicalSpace X], and there is a (multiplicative) action [MulAction G X] that is continuous [ContinuousMulAction G X]. So we have a continuous action of the topological group G on the topological space X.
  - Y is a topological space.
- Data/assumptions:
  - π : X → Y, a map.
  - h_cont : Continuous π, the map is continuous.
  - h_surj : Surjective π, the map is surjective.
  - h_compact : CompactSpace Y, the space Y is compact.
  - h_fiber : ∀ x, π ⁻¹' {π x} = MulAction.orbit G x. This says that for each x in X, the fiber of π over π x is exactly the G-orbit of x. Thus π identifies points exactly along orbits; i.e., Y is (set-theoretically) the orbit space X/G, and π is the orbit map.
- Theorem statement:
  - exists_point_with_compact_stabilizer_and_compact_transversal:
    - First conjunct: ∀ x : X, ∃ x' ∈ MulAction.orbit G x, IsCompact {g : G | g • x' = x'}. This says: for every x in X, there exists a point x' in the orbit of x whose stabilizer subgroup {g ∈ G | g • x' = x'} is compact as a subset of the topological group G.
    - Second conjunct: ∃ K : Set X, IsCompact K ∧ ∀ x : X, Set.Nonempty (K ∩ MulAction.orbit G x). This says: there exists a compact subset K of X that intersects every G-orbit in X.

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement.
- Natural language assumptions: A group Γ acts on a topological space X and X/Γ is compact. For compactness of stabilizers to make sense, Γ needs a topology; the Lean code explicitly assumes Γ is a topological group and the action is continuous — a standard formalization of a ""group acting on a topological space"" in this context.
- Lean assumptions encode ""X/Γ is compact"" by positing a compact space Y and a continuous surjection π : X → Y with fibers equal to orbits. Set-theoretically, Y is the set of Γ-orbits; topologically, this is exactly what one would take for the quotient X/Γ via the quotient map. They do not assume π is a quotient map, but this is not used in the conclusions. This is a reasonable and faithful formalization of the assumption ""X/Γ is compact.""
- Conclusions match precisely:
  - ""Every orbit Γ x contains a point with compact stabilizer"" corresponds exactly to the first conjunct.
  - ""X contains a compact set intersecting every Γ-orbit"" corresponds exactly to the second conjunct.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; all structures and predicates come from Mathlib.
- The only potential nuance is that the code assumes a topological group and continuous action (reasonable/standard) and represents X/Γ being compact via the existence of a compact Y with fibers equal to orbits. This is a standard formalization and amounts to the same assumption for the purpose of the stated conclusions.
- The statement is thus a faithful translation: same hypotheses in spirit and identical conclusions.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem faithfully translates the natural language statement.

- Conclusion asserted: there exists a unique homomorphism φ : G →* Γ such that for all a and x : G_a a, φ (ι_a a x) = φ_a a x, i.e., φ extends the φ_a along the maps ι_a.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is the van Kampen extension property for the fundamental group π1(X,x0) of a topological space X under specific hypotheses (path connected, locally simply connected, cover by path-connected open sets with all finite intersections path connected). It says: given homomorphisms from each π1(X_a,x0) to Γ compatible on each π1(X_ab,x0), there is a unique homomorphism π1(X,x0) → Γ extending them.
- The Lean statement is a purely algebraic universal property: given arbitrary groups G_a, G_ab, maps incl_a/incl_b to the pieces, and maps ι_a into a global group G, then for any Γ and compatible φ_a there exists a unique φ : G →* Γ extending the φ_a. There is no topological content, no fundamental group, no hypotheses that guarantee that G has the colimit/coequalizer property implied by van Kampen. It asserts this universal extension for an arbitrary diagram into an arbitrary group G.

3) Are the two statements the same?
- No. The topological statement concludes the universal property specifically for G = π1(X,x0), and the hypotheses are precisely those under which van Kampen ensures π1 is the colimit of the diagram of π1(X_a) with their intersections. The Lean code drops all topological structure and asserts the universal property for an arbitrary group G with inclusions ι_a, without assuming G is the colimit. This is a much stronger (and generally false) algebraic claim.
- Additional differences:
  - The natural statement references π1 and basepoints; the code has none of that and replaces them with arbitrary groups.
  - The natural statement requires finite intersections path-connected; the code only involves pairwise G_ab and no higher intersections.
  - The comment mentions injections ι_a, but the code does not assume injectivity.

Conclusion: The Lean theorem statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement; it abstracts away the essential topological hypotheses and asserts an unqualified universal property for arbitrary G, which is not equivalent to the original statement.

- The code sets up three types X, Y, Z with topologies on all three: [TopologicalSpace X], [TopologicalSpace Y], [TopologicalSpace Z]. It also assumes X is Hausdorff: [T2Space X].
- It assumes f : X → Y is a covering map via (hf : IsCoveringMap f).
- It considers two maps g1, g2 : Z → X and assumes they project identically under f: (hfg : f ∘ g1 = f ∘ g2), i.e., for all z, f(g1 z) = f(g2 z).
- It further assumes Z is connected: (hconn : ConnectedSpace Z).

- The natural language statement does not assume Z is connected or even topological (though typically one would endow Z with a topology to discuss coverings and lifts). The result as stated is generally false without connectedness: two lifts can differ on different connected components.
- The Lean code adds the crucial hypothesis ConnectedSpace Z. This is a stronger hypothesis than the natural language statement and changes the theorem to the correct classical uniqueness result on connected domains.
- The code does not assume continuity of g1, g2, and the natural language statement also does not mention continuity; so this aspect matches.

3) Final comparison:
- The Lean code proves a different (stronger-hypothesis) theorem than the text: it requires Z to be connected. The natural language statement asserts uniqueness without connectedness. Therefore, the translation is not faithful to the original statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `variables {piX piY : Type _} (f0 f1 : piX → piY) (x_star : piX → piX) (y_star : piY → piY)` introduces two arbitrary types `piX` and `piY`, two arbitrary functions `f0, f1 : piX → piY`, an arbitrary endofunction `x_star : piX → piX`, and an arbitrary endofunction `y_star : piY → piY`.
- `theorem y_star_comp_f0_eq_f1_comp_x_star : y_star ∘ f0 = f1 ∘ x_star := by sorry` states (without proof) that the composition `y_star ∘ f0` equals the composition `f1 ∘ x_star` as functions `piX → piY`.

2) Does this match the natural language statement?
- The original statement is about a homotopy F between maps X → Y, basepoints x0, x1 in X, induced paths y in Y, and the induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups: x_* : π1(X, x0) → π1(X, x1), y_* : π1(Y, y0) → π1(Y, y1), and (f0)_*, (f1)_* between π1(X, −) and π1(Y, −). The target equation is y_* ∘ (f0)_* = (f1)_* ∘ x_* : π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, y1).
- The Lean code has no mention of topological spaces, homotopies, paths, basepoints, or fundamental groups. It does not define or reference induced maps on π1, nor the basepoint-change isomorphisms. It simply asserts an equality of arbitrary function compositions between abstract types.
- Furthermore, the types in the original statement for x_* and y_* are between potentially different fundamental groups (π1(X, x0) → π1(X, x1) and π1(Y, y0) → π1(Y, y1)), not endomorphisms. The code forces both domain and codomain to be the same type for x_star and y_star, losing essential structure.
- The code also lacks all necessary hypotheses (existence of F, x, and construction of y), and thus does not capture the conditions under which the equality holds.

3) Final check: are the two problems the same?
- No. The Lean statement is an unconditioned equation between four arbitrary functions on two arbitrary types. The mathematical statement is a precise claim about induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups arising from a homotopy and specific paths, with basepoint changes. The code omits all the topology and algebraic-topology structure and collapses potentially different fundamental groups into single types.
- Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

Summary of discrepancies:
- Missing topological spaces, homotopy F, paths x and y.
- Missing fundamental groups and induced homomorphisms ((f0)_*, (f1)_*, x_*, y_*).
- Wrong typing for x_* and y_* (endo vs isomorphisms between possibly different basepointed groups).
- No Mathlib concepts used; purely abstract functions.
- Unproven statement with `sorry` (allowed for this audit, but irrelevant since the statement itself is not faithful).

1) Line-by-line translation and assessment:
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]` sets up a topological space X.
- `variable {A : Set X}` fixes a subset A of X.

Theorem `isClosed_subtype_iff {s : Set A}`:
- Statement: `IsClosed (s : Set A) ↔ ∃ C : Set X, IsClosed C ∧ ((coe : A → X) '' s = A ∩ C)`.
- Natural language: A subset s of A (viewed in the subspace topology on A) is closed in A if and only if there exists a closed set C in X such that the image of s under the inclusion map A → X (so, s viewed as a subset of X) equals A ∩ C.
- This is exactly the standard characterization: the closed subsets of the subspace A are precisely the intersections with closed sets in X. The use of `(coe : A → X) '' s` is the canonical way to compare a subset of A with a subset of X; it encodes the same set of points as s but as a subset of X.

Theorem `closure_subtype_eq {s : Set A}`:
- Statement: `(coe : A → X) '' (closure (s : Set A)) = closure ((coe : A → X) '' s) ∩ A`.
- Natural language: The image in X of the closure of s inside A equals the intersection of A with the closure in X of s (viewed in X). This is the standard formula for closure in a subspace: `closure_A(s)`, when regarded as a subset of X, equals `A ∩ closure_X(s)`.

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- First part of the natural-language claim: closed subsets of A in the subspace topology are exactly the sets A ∩ C for closed C ⊆ X. The Lean equivalence `IsClosed s ↔ ∃ C, IsClosed C ∧ coe '' s = A ∩ C` captures precisely this characterization, using the inclusion map to compare subsets of A with subsets of X.
- Second part: the closure of S ⊆ A inside A equals A ∩ closure_X(S). The Lean statement expresses exactly this equality when transported to X via the inclusion map.

3) Final check and differences:
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only standard Mathlib notions (TopologicalSpace, IsClosed, closure, image) are used.
- The code states both directions for the closed sets characterization as a logical equivalence, matching the ""exactly"" of the natural statement.
- The closure statement is given in the standard pushed-forward form via the inclusion, which is mathematically equivalent to the natural-language formulation.
- No substantive differences or scope changes; the translation is faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean statements are legitimate and faithfully translate the natural-language claims.

1) Line-by-line translation:
- `import Mathlib` and `open Set`: Load Mathlib and open the Set namespace. No impact on the mathematical content.
- `variable {X Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]`: We have two types X and Y equipped with topological space structures (i.e., topological spaces).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The natural language statement asks to prove (A × B)^∘ = A^∘ × B^∘ and \overline{A} × \overline{B} = \overline{A × B}. The Lean statements are exactly these equalities, using `interior` for ^∘ and `closure` for overline, and `×ˢ` for Cartesian product.
- The Lean code explicitly includes both X and Y as topological spaces, which is the standard and necessary formal context for A × B. The natural statement mentioned only X, but since A × B appears, implicitly Y is also present; thus the Lean code is a faithful and precise formalization.
- There are no auxiliary (potentially vacuous) definitions; only theorem statements with admitted proofs. This is acceptable under the instructions.

3) Final check: The math problems are the same. The only minor difference is that Lean makes explicit the second space Y, which is required for the product. No discrepancy in meaning or generality (it matches the intended product-topology setting).

Step 1: Translate each line of Lean code.
- `variables {X Y Z : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z]` sets up three topological spaces X, Y, Z.
- `variable (q : X → Y)` introduces a map q from X to Y.
- `def is_quotient_map : Prop := Function.Surjective q ∧ ∀ U : Set Y, IsOpen U ↔ IsOpen (q ⁻¹' U)` defines what it means for q to be a quotient map: q is surjective and a set U in Y is open if and only if its preimage under q is open in X. This is the standard definition of a quotient map (i.e., Y has the quotient/final topology induced by q).
- `theorem continuous_quotient_iff {h : Y → Z} (hq : is_quotient_map q) : Continuous h ↔ Continuous (h ∘ q)` states the universal property of quotient maps: a function h from the quotient space Y to any space Z is continuous if and only if the composite h ∘ q from X to Z is continuous, assuming q is a quotient map.
- `theorem continuous_descend_iff {F : X → Z} (hq : is_quotient_map q) : (∃ g : Y → Z, Continuous g ∧ g ∘ q = F) ↔ (Continuous F ∧ ∀ x1 x2 : X, q x1 = q x2 → F x1 = F x2)` states that a map F from X to Z factors through Y via a continuous map g : Y → Z (i.e., F = g ∘ q) if and only if F is continuous and constant on the fibers of q (i.e., whenever q x1 = q x2, then F x1 = F x2).

Step 2: Compare to the natural language statement.
- The natural statement takes Y to be the quotient space X/∼ and q the canonical quotient map. The Lean code abstracts this by any space Y together with q satisfying the quotient map property; this is a standard and faithful generalization.
- First part: ""A map h : X/∼ → Y is continuous iff h ∘ q : X → Y is continuous."" This matches `continuous_quotient_iff` exactly, with a renaming of spaces (Lean uses Y for the quotient and Z for the target).
- Second part: ""A continuous map F : X → Y descends to a continuous map X/∼ → Y iff F(x1)=F(x2) whenever x1 ∼ x2."" In the code, this appears as an equivalence between existence of a continuous g with F = g ∘ q and the conjunction of continuity of F and constancy on the fibers of q. Since the natural language already assumes F is continuous, including `Continuous F` on the right is consistent. Equality on fibers `q x1 = q x2` corresponds to the equivalence relation x1 ∼ x2 in the quotient setting.

Step 3: Final check for differences.
- The code uses a general quotient map q : X → Y instead of explicitly Y = X/∼, but this is a standard and acceptable generalization.
- The code explicitly includes `Continuous F` in the right-hand side of the second equivalence, while the natural statement assumes F is continuous from the outset. These are equivalent formulations.
- All auxiliary definitions are legitimate (no vacuous placeholders); `is_quotient_map` is a faithful definition.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully capture the mathematical content of the natural language statement, with only harmless generalization/renaming.

Step 1: Line-by-line translation of the Lean code
- `variables {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]`: We fix a type X with a topological space structure.
- `variable (π1X : Type _)`: Introduce an arbitrary type π1X (intended to represent π₁(X), but it is not connected to X in any way).
- `variable (Γ : Set π1X)`: Introduce an arbitrary subset Γ of π1X (not a subgroup structure).
- The docstring describes the intended classification statement, but is not part of the formal statement.
- `theorem exists_connected_covering_of_subgroup (h_path_connected : Prop) (h_locally_simply_connected : Prop) : ...`: The hypotheses are two arbitrary propositions (not the actual Mathlib notions `PathConnected X` and `LocallySimplyConnected X`, nor connected to X); they are not used further.
- The existential conclusion asserts the existence of:
  - `p_space : Type _` with `p_top : TopologicalSpace p_space`,
  - a map `p_map : p_space → X`,
  - two arbitrary propositions `is_covering : Prop` and `is_connected : Prop` (not tied to `p_map` or `p_space`),
  - a type `pπ1 : Type _` and a function `p_star : pπ1 → π1X`,
  - such that `Set.range p_star = Γ`.
- There is no relationship enforced between `is_covering` and `p_map` (i.e., no covering map structure), nor between `is_connected` and `p_space` (i.e., no connectedness assertion). There is also no relation between `p_star` and `p_map` (i.e., no induced map on fundamental groups). No uniqueness clause appears in the theorem statement. The proof is `sorry` (permitted for checking translation, but indicates no actual content).

Step 2: Compare with the natural language statement
The natural language statement requires:
- X is path connected and locally simply connected (actual topological properties of X),
- Γ is a subgroup of π₁(X) (with actual fundamental group structure; typically at a basepoint),
- existence of a connected covering p : X_Γ → X whose induced map on fundamental groups p_* has image Γ,
- uniqueness of X_Γ up to unique isomorphism of coverings.

The Lean statement instead:
- Uses arbitrary `Prop` placeholders for path connectedness and local simple connectivity, not tied to X and not Mathlib definitions.
- Treats π1X as an arbitrary type and Γ as an arbitrary set, not a subgroup of the actual fundamental group of X.
- Produces a space p_space and map p_map but only asserts existence of two unrelated propositions `is_covering` and `is_connected` without any connection to p_map or p_space (so the code does not claim p_map is a covering or p_space is connected).
- Introduces pπ1 and p_star with no relation to p_space or p_map, and only requires `Set.range p_star = Γ` (so p_star need not be an induced map on π₁ nor a group homomorphism).
- Omits the uniqueness up to unique isomorphism entirely from the formal statement.

Step 3: Final check — are the two statements the same?
No. There are multiple serious discrepancies:
- Missing use of actual Mathlib notions: no `PathConnected`, no `LocallySimplyConnected`, no `CoveringMap`, no `Connected`/`IsConnected`, no `FundamentalGroup`, no induced map `p_*`.
- Γ is just a set, not a subgroup; no basepoint appears.
- The existence part is vacuous: `is_covering` and `is_connected` are arbitrary Props, not tied to the objects they should describe; `p_star` is unrelated to `p_map`.
- The uniqueness clause is completely absent from the theorem.
- Even if the placeholders were replaced by legitimate definitions, the missing uniqueness and subgroup structure would still make the statement not faithful.

Conclusion: The Lean code does not faithfully formalize the natural language statement.

A faithful Lean statement would at least define X and Y (as topological subspaces), the quotient identifying 0 and 1 in X, and then assert the existence of a homeomorphism (or equivalently, `X ⧸ r ≃ₜ Y` for the appropriate relation r). The provided code does none of this: it does not define X, Y, the quotient, or a homeomorphism; it does not even state a concrete proposition. It is just an arbitrary `Prop` with a placeholder proof.

3) Final check (same or different?):
They are completely different. The Lean code does not express the mathematical content at all. There are no auxiliary definitions, but the single declaration is vacuous and unrelated to the target claim.

Therefore, the translation is not faithful.

No auxiliary definitions; no placeholders beyond the proof hole `sorry` (which does not affect the statement).

2) Faithfulness to the original statement:
- The Lean theorem asserts the exact biconditional with the same quantification over all subsets A ⊆ Y and the same closure equality. This matches the natural language statement precisely.

- Domains/codomains/topologies align perfectly.
- The equality is exactly as in the natural language statement, with preimage and closure in the appropriate spaces.

Hence, the Lean code is a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

1) Line-by-line translation of the Lean code:
- `theorem path_subdivision {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X] {A : Type _} (U : A → Set X)`: We have a topological space X and a family of subsets of X indexed by A.
- `(hcover : (⋃ a : A, U a) = set.univ)`: The family U covers X; i.e., the union of all U a is the whole space X.
- `{x : Real → X} (hcont : ContinuousOn x (Set.Icc (0 : Real) 1))`: We have a map x: ℝ → X which is continuous on the closed interval [0,1]. So this encodes a path on [0,1].
- Conclusion: `∃ (n : Nat) (t : Fin (n+1) → Real) (a : Fin n → A), t (0 : Fin (n+1)) = 0 ∧ t (Fin.last n) = 1 ∧ (∀ i : Fin n, t i < t (i.succ)) ∧ (∀ i : Fin n, Set.image x (Set.Icc (t i) (t (i.succ))) ⊆ U (a i))`:

    - the sequence is strictly increasing: t_i < t_{i+1},
    - for each i, the image x([t_i, t_{i+1}]) is contained in U_{a_i}.
This matches the structure: a finite subdivision of [0,1] so that each subinterval maps into one member of the cover.

2) Compare to the natural language statement:
- Natural statement: X is covered by open sets {X_a}_{a∈A}, and x:[0,1]→X is a path (continuous). Then there exist 0=t_0<…<t_n=1 and indices a_0,…,a_{n−1} with x([t_i,t_{i+1}]) ⊆ X_{a_i}.
- Lean statement: identical conclusion and hypotheses except it only assumes a cover by arbitrary sets U a (no assumption that each U a is open). It does assume x is continuous on [0,1], which matches “path”. The cover is stated as a union equals univ, which is the same as “covers X”. The conclusion uses closed intervals and subset inclusion exactly as in the natural statement.

3) Final check: Are they the same?
- Key discrepancy: The natural language requires the covering sets to be open. The Lean statement does not assume openness of U a. This is a significant mathematical difference: the usual proof and the result rely on the cover being open (e.g., via compactness and the Lebesgue number lemma). Dropping openness makes the Lean theorem a strictly stronger (indeed generally false) claim. Everything else matches closely.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; only a theorem statement with a placeholder proof, which is acceptable per the instructions. But the missing openness hypothesis means the translation is not faithful.

Conclusion: Not faithful due to omission of the openness assumption on the covering sets.

",9,"### BEGIN THOUGHT
Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- `variable {n : ℕ}` introduces a natural number n.
- `def E := Fin n → ℝ` defines E to be the type of functions from `Fin n` to ℝ, i.e., ℝ^n as an n-fold product. Note: with this choice (as opposed to the type synonym `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`), the default norm on E is the sup norm, not the Euclidean norm.
- `noncomputable def f (x : E) : ℝ × E := ...` defines a function `f : E → ℝ × E` by
  - if `x = 0` then `f x = (1, 0)`;
  - else set `r = ‖x‖` and define `f x = (cos (π * r), (sin (π * r) * r⁻¹) • x)`. This matches the intended formula `f(x) = (cos(π‖x‖), sin(π‖x‖) x/‖x‖)` for `x ≠ 0` and `f(0) = (1, 0)`.
  The codomain `ℝ × E` is isomorphic to ℝ^{n+1}.
- `theorem f_maps_boundary_to_pole (x : E) (hx : ‖x‖ = 1) : f x = (-1, (0 : E)) := by sorry` states that if ‖x‖ = 1 then `f x = (-1, 0)`. This expresses that every point on the unit “sphere” (with respect to the chosen norm) maps to the south pole. The proof is omitted (sorry), which is acceptable for translation auditing.
- `theorem f_injective_on_open_ball {x y : E} (hx : ‖x‖ < 1) (hy : ‖y‖ < 1) (h : f x = f y) : x = y := by sorry` states that `f` is injective on the open unit ball `{x | ‖x‖ < 1}` (again, with respect to the chosen norm). Proof omitted.

Faithfulness to the natural language statement:
- The natural statement is in ℝ^n with the Euclidean norm, with `X` the closed Euclidean unit ball, `A` its Euclidean boundary sphere, and `Y` the Euclidean unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}. The function `f` is defined as given and is asserted to be injective on the interior `X \ A` (the Euclidean open unit ball) and to send every point of `A` to `(-1, 0)`.
- The Lean code captures the same functional formula and the two asserted properties:
  - It asserts that all points of the unit sphere (norm = 1) map to `(-1, 0)`.
  - It asserts injectivity on the open unit ball (norm < 1).
- However, there are important differences:
  1) Norm mismatch: `E := Fin n → ℝ` carries the default sup norm on the Pi type, not the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm. The natural statement clearly refers to the Euclidean norm. This changes the meaning of “unit ball,” “boundary sphere,” and the radial parameter `‖x‖` in the definition of `f`.
  2) Domain/codomain typing: The Lean code defines `f : E → ℝ × E`, not `f : X → Y` with `X` the closed unit ball and `Y` the unit sphere. The two theorems are stated only for `‖x‖ = 1` and `‖x‖ < 1`, which correspond to the intended subsets, but the codomain is not restricted to the unit sphere. The natural statement’s codomain restriction `Y` (unit sphere in ℝ^{n+1}) is not modeled. Though not needed to state the two target properties, it is part of the original setup.
  3) The code does not introduce `X`, `A`, or `Y` as sets; it works directly with norms and subset predicates. This is acceptable as a reformulation, provided the norm is the intended Euclidean one (which it is not).

Final comparison:
- Content-wise, the two theorems match the two properties to be proved (injectivity on the interior, mapping the boundary to `(-1,0)`), but they are stated with respect to the sup norm on ℝ^n rather than the Euclidean norm. Also, the mapping into the unit sphere `Y` is not stated, though that is background context rather than one of the two explicit claims.
- The norm issue is a substantive discrepancy, since the problem is explicitly Euclidean. Therefore, the translation is not fully faithful.

Grade justification:
- No vacuous definitions; function and theorems mirror the intended statements closely.
- The norm mismatch is the main flaw; otherwise it is a good formalization strategy.
- Hence: not faithful (binary), but close: grade 9.

  - Missing monotonicity/range of τ: The code does not assume τ is strictly increasing or that τ maps [0,1] into [0,1]; it only assumes continuity and endpoint conditions. This weakens the hypothesis compared to the statement.
  - Most importantly, the relative endpoint condition is not encoded. The code’s conclusion lacks the requirement that for all s ∈ [0,1], H(0,s) = x 0 and H(1,s) = x 1. It only asserts H(0,0)=x 0 and H(1,0)=x 1 (two points), not constancy along the s-direction at the endpoints. Thus it does not express “homotopic relative to {0,1}.”
  - Also, the statement assumes x,y are paths (continuous maps from [0,1]), while the code does not assume x,y are continuous; although if such an H exists, the restrictions of x,y to [0,1] would be continuous as traces of H, this mismatch is secondary to the missing relative condition.

3) Final check:
- The central mathematical property—homotopy relative to endpoints—is not captured: the endpoint constancy in s is missing. The monotonicity (strictly increasing) condition on τ is also omitted. Therefore, the formal statement is not a faithful translation of the natural language statement.

Step 1: Translate each Lean line into natural language.
- Theorem real_finite_dimensional_field_eq_R_or_C:
  Statement: For any type k with [Field k] and [Algebra Real k] (i.e., k is a field equipped with an ℝ-algebra structure, so it ""contains"" ℝ) and [FiniteDimensional Real k] (k is finite-dimensional as a real vector space), we have that k is (as an ℝ-algebra) isomorphic to ℝ or to ℂ: (k ≃ₐ[Real] Real) ∨ (k ≃ₐ[Real] Complex).
  This matches the classical result: finite-dimensional field extensions of ℝ are ℝ or ℂ.

- Theorem finite_dimensional_real_field_finrank_le_two:
  Statement: Under the same hypotheses on k as above, finrank Real k ≤ 2. This asserts that any finite-dimensional real field extension has degree at most 2 over ℝ. This is a direct numerical version of the previous theorem and in fact a slight generalization of the ""in particular"" clause about degrees.

- Theorem complex_polynomial_splits:
  Statement: For any complex polynomial p : Polynomial Complex, Polynomial.IsSplit p. In Mathlib, IsSplit means p splits completely into linear factors over the given field (here ℂ). This is exactly the fundamental theorem of algebra in the splitting form.

Step 2: Compare with the original statement.
- The main claim: If k is a field containing ℝ and finite-dimensional over ℝ, then k = ℝ or k = ℂ up to isomorphism. The first theorem states precisely this as an ℝ-algebra isomorphism.
- ""In particular, the splitting field of any real or complex polynomial in one variable has degree at most 2 over ℝ"": The second theorem is a general statement that any finite-dimensional real field extension has finrank ≤ 2. Since splitting fields are finite extensions of ℝ in the real/complex cases, this immediately implies the desired ""at most 2"" degree bound for splitting fields, so it's a valid and slightly stronger formulation of that ""in particular"".
- ""Every complex polynomial in one variable splits into a product of linear factors over ℂ"": The third theorem states exactly this via Polynomial.IsSplit for polynomials over ℂ.

Step 3: Final check for discrepancies.
- No vacuous or placeholder definitions are introduced; only theorem statements are given (with proofs omitted via sorry, which is acceptable for this auditing task). The statements use standard Mathlib notions (Field, Algebra Real k, FiniteDimensional, finrank, AlgEquiv, Polynomial.IsSplit) correctly.
- The only potential difference is that the code does not explicitly mention splitting fields; instead it gives a general degree bound (finrank ≤ 2) for any finite real field extension, which implies the specific corollary about splitting fields. This is an acceptable slight generalization per the guidelines.

Conclusion: The Lean statements faithfully capture the original mathematical content.

1) Line-by-line translation
- `variable {X : Type _} [TopologicalSpace X]` introduces a topological space X.
- `variable (s : Setoid X)` introduces an equivalence relation s on X.
- `variable [TopologicalSpace (Quotient s)]` brings into scope a topology on the quotient type Quotient s (in Mathlib, this is the canonical quotient topology). 
- `variable {Y : Type _} [TopologicalSpace Y]` introduces a topological space Y.
- `def q : X → Quotient s := Quotient.mk` defines the canonical quotient map q sending x to its equivalence class in the quotient.
- `theorem continuous_comp_quotient {h : Quotient s → Y} (h_cont : Continuous h) : Continuous (h ∘ q) := by sorry` states: if h: X/~ → Y is continuous, then the composition h ∘ q: X → Y is continuous. This matches the standard property that composing a continuous map out of the quotient with the quotient map is continuous.
- `theorem continuous_factor_through_quotient_iff {f : X → Y} : (∃! (h : Quotient s → Y), Continuous h ∧ h ∘ q = f) ↔ (Continuous f ∧ ∀ x₁ x₂ : X, Quotient.mk x₁ = Quotient.mk x₂ → f x₁ = f x₂) := by sorry` states an equivalence: there exists a unique continuous map h: X/~ → Y such that f = h ∘ q if and only if f is continuous and constant on equivalence classes, expressed as: if Quotient.mk x₁ = Quotient.mk x₂ (i.e., x₁ and x₂ are equivalent), then f x₁ = f x₂. The uniqueness is among continuous h, matching the wording ""unique continuous h"".

2) Faithfulness to the natural language
- First part: ""any continuous map h: X/~ → Y induces a continuous h ∘ q"" is exactly the statement of `continuous_comp_quotient`.
- Second part: ""Conversely, a continuous f: X → Y arises in this way (i.e., f = h ∘ q for a unique continuous h) iff f is constant on equivalence classes"" matches the iff theorem. The RHS explicitly includes `Continuous f` and the class-constancy condition; the LHS is existence and uniqueness of a continuous h with f = h ∘ q. Using `Quotient.mk x₁ = Quotient.mk x₂` to express x₁ ∼ x₂ is standard and equivalent in Mathlib, so this matches the intended meaning.
- The use of `[TopologicalSpace (Quotient s)]` is consistent with Mathlib's canonical quotient topology; the statements are intended for that instance. No vacuous or placeholder definitions are present; `q` is the genuine quotient map.

3) Final check
- The Lean statements are equivalent in mathematical meaning to the natural language claims: both directions are correctly captured, including continuity and uniqueness conditions. No discrepancies or hidden weakenings/strengthenings affect the intended result.

Therefore, the code is a faithful translation.

2) Comparison to the natural language statement:
- Domain/codomain and objects: The vectors v_i ∈ ℝ^n are modeled as v : Fin n → (Fin n → ℝ). The Gram matrix entries are ⟨v_i, v_j⟩ computed by the Euclidean inner product. This matches the statement.
- Invariance: The hypothesis hO corresponds exactly to invariance under simultaneous orthogonal transformations: f(U v_1, ..., U v_n) = f(v_1, ..., v_n) for all U ∈ O(n). Here orthogonality is encoded as Uᵀ U = I, which is standard and equivalent to U ∈ O(n).
- Continuity: The assumption hf : Continuous f matches the continuity of f in the original.
- Conclusion: The theorem asserts existence of a continuous g such that f factors through the Gram map: f(v) = g(Gram(v)). This aligns with the claim that there exists g on the set Y of positive semidefinite symmetric matrices with f(v) = g(A).

3) Differences and their significance:
- The Lean statement produces g defined on all matrices Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ (with continuity on the whole space), whereas the natural language specifies g : Y → ℝ where Y is the set of psd symmetric matrices. Since every Gram matrix lies in Y, the Lean statement is a strengthening: such a g on all matrices restricts to a continuous function on Y with the required property. This is a slight generalization and does not detract from faithfulness.
- The code does not explicitly define Y nor mention symmetry/psd; however, gram_map’s image is contained in Y, and the factorization f = g ∘ gram_map expresses the intended dependence on the Gram matrix. No vacuous placeholders are used; all auxiliary definitions are meaningful.

Final check: The mathematical content matches: a continuous O(n)-invariant function of n vectors in ℝ^n depends only (continuously) on their Gram matrix, i.e., factors through the Gram map. The only deviation is the benign strengthening of the codomain of g from Y to all matrices, which is acceptable.

Step-by-step translation of the Lean code:
- It fixes a topological space X.
- It models the one-point compactification as Option X, with None representing ∞ and Some x representing x ∈ X.
- Definition `one_point_compact_topology`: A topology on Option X is defined via `TopologicalSpace.generateFrom` a set of subbasic sets which is the union of two families:
  1) Sets U ⊆ Option X such that None ∉ U and the preimage of U under Option.some (i.e., {x | Some x ∈ U}) is open in X.
  2) Sets U ⊆ Option X such that None ∈ U and there exists C ⊆ X compact with U = {None} ∪ (univ \ C).
- The theorem `one_point_compactification_exists` claims: for all U ⊆ Option X, U is open in this topology if and only if either (i) None ∉ U and Option.some ⁻¹' U is open in X, or (ii) None ∈ U and there exists a compact C ⊆ X with U = {None} ∪ (univ \ C).

Assessment of correctness and faithfulness:
- Modeling the space as Option X with None as ∞ is standard and faithful in spirit.
- First family (None ∉ U and Option.some ⁻¹' U open) correctly captures “U is open in X (viewed inside the compactification)”. This is fine.
- Second family has a typing/embedding issue: the set “{None} ∪ (univ \ C)” mixes a Set (Option X) with a Set X. To talk about a subset of Option X corresponding to X \ C, one must embed via Some: the correct expression is {None} ∪ (Some '' (univ \ C)). As written, the code appears ill-typed; absent an implicit coercion (which Mathlib does not provide), it would not compile. This is a serious mismatch from the intended mathematical object.
- Even ignoring typing, the definition via `generateFrom` only ensures these sets are subbasic opens; the theorem then claims that exactly these sets are all the opens (i.e., open iff U is in one of the two families). This is generally false: the topology generated by a subbasis typically contains arbitrary unions of finite intersections of such sets, not just the subbasic sets themselves. Thus the equivalence stated in the theorem is too strong in general.
- Regarding the natural language statement: it says “Declare U open if either U is open in X, or U = {∞} ∪ (X \ C) for some compact C.” Taken literally (with equality), this does not define a topology unless additional hypotheses are imposed (e.g., locally compact Hausdorff and understanding opens containing ∞ as supersets of sets of the form {∞} ∪ (X \ K) with K compact). The standard correct form is: U is open and contains ∞ iff there exists a compact C with {∞} ∪ (X \ C) ⊆ U. The Lean statement mirrors the literal (but problematic) equality rather than the “superset” condition, so even the intended math in the code’s theorem is mis-specified.
- The theorem has `by sorry`, but per the auditing guidelines we focus on statements/definitions; the definition is non-vacuous, but the theorem’s statement itself does not faithfully capture the correct topology (and likely contradicts the `generateFrom` def).

Final comparison:
- Intended: define a topology on X ∪ {∞} with opens either coming from opens in X not containing ∞, or sets containing ∞ that are exactly {∞} ∪ (X \ C) for some compact C (as written).
- Code: defines a topology generated by those two classes, then claims precisely those classes are the opens. This is not faithful for two reasons: (1) the second clause is ill-typed and missing the Some-image; (2) even conceptually, the generated topology is larger than the generating family, so the “iff” is incorrect. Therefore, the code does not legitimately and faithfully formalize the natural language statement.
