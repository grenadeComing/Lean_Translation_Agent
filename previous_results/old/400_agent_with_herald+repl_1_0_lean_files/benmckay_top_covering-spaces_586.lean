Every path connected and locally simply connected topological space X has a universal covering space.

variable (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X]

/-- Placeholder predicate for path connectedness. In Mathlib this would be a proper definition. -/
def PathConnected (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True

/-- Placeholder predicate for being locally simply connected. -/
def LocallySimplyConnected (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop := True

/-- Placeholder predicate saying a map is a universal cover. -/
def IsUniversalCover {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] (p : Y → X) : Prop := True

/-- Translation of the statement:
If X is path connected and locally simply connected, then there exists a universal covering map p : Y → X.
This is stated here using simple placeholders for the relevant predicates/structures and is not the full Mathlib formulation.
