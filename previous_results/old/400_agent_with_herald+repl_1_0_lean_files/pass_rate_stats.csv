Inverse Function Theorem (translation).

Suppose U ⊂ ℝ^n is open, f : U → ℝ^n is continuously differentiable, p ∈ U, and Df|_p is
invertible (that is, det Df|_p ≠ 0). Then there exist open sets V, W ⊂ ℝ^n such that
p ∈ V ⊂ U, f(V) = W, the restriction f|_V is injective, and hence a g : W → V exists
such that g(y) = (f|_V)^{-1}(y) for all y ∈ W. Furthermore, g is continuously
differentiable and Dg|_y = (Df|_x)^{-1} for all x ∈ V, y = f(x).

Van Kampen (informal statement).

Let X be a path connected and locally simply connected topological space with basepoint x0.
Let {X_a}_{a : ι} be an open cover of X by path connected open sets such that every intersection
X_{ab} := X_a ∩ X_b is path connected and each X_a and each X_{ab} contain the basepoint x0.
Write π := π_1(X,x0), π_a := π_1(X_a,x0), and π_{ab} := π_1(X_{ab},x0).
Then π is the amalgamated free product of the groups π_a amalgamated along the subgroups π_{ab};
in other words π ≅ *_{π_{ab}} π_a.
