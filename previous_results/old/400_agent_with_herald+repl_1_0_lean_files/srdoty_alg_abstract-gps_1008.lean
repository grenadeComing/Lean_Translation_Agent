variable {G : Type _} [Group G]

/--
Abstract formalization of the statement:
Let O(2) be the group of real 2×2 orthogonal matrices and SO(2) the subgroup of rotations.
For any fixed improper orthogonal matrix A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2), O(2) is generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}.

We state a general version for a group G with subgroups O2 and SO2, assuming SO2 ⊆ O2 and A ∈ O2 \ SO2.
The conclusion asserts that the subgroup generated by SO2 ∪ {A} equals O2.
