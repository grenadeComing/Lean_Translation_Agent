/-- Van Kampen-style statement (hypotheses left as placeholders): the fundamental group of X
    (based at x0) is the amalgamation of the fundamental groups of the open cover pieces and
    their intersections. The RHS is represented by the abstract constant
    `amalgamated_free_product`. The statement ends with `:= by sorry` as requested. -/
