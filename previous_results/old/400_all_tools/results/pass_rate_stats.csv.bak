Translate: For any positive integer n, if A is an n×n matrix and B is the matrix
obtained from A by performing a single elementary row operation, then B = U * A,
where U is the corresponding elementary n×n elementary matrix of the same type.

We define an inductive type for row operations, a function that applies a row
operation to a matrix, construct the elementary matrix by applying the
operation to the identity, and define a matrix multiplication using Finset.univ.sum.
Finally we state the theorem that applying the row operation to A equals
(elementary_matrix op) * A. The proof is omitted (:= by sorry).

Abstract algebraic translation of the topological statement:
Let F : I × X → Y be a homotopy with f_t = F(t, ·). Given paths x and y as in the
statement, one gets isomorphisms x_* : π1(X,x0) → π1(X,x1) and y_* : π1(Y,y0) → π1(Y,y1).
The corresponding algebraic statement for group homomorphisms is the naturality
condition y_iso ∘ f0 = f1 ∘ x_iso.

We state the analogous equality for the underlying functions of multiplicative
homomorphisms; the proof is omitted (:= by sorry) per the instructions.
