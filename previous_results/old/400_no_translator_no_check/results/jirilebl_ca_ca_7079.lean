Suppose γ : [a,b] → ℂ \ {0} is a piecewise smooth curve and θ : [a,b] → ℝ is continuous
such that e^{i θ(t)} = γ(t) / |γ(t)| for all t ∈ [a,b]. Suppose γ is simple and does not
go through the origin. Then there exists a lift θ̃ : [a,b] → ℝ with the same property and
θ̃(a) = θ(a), and furthermore θ̃(b) = θ̃(a) + 2π iff the origin is inside the region bounded by γ.
