Abstract formalization of the statement:
Suppose T : V → V is self-adjoint (assumed as a hypothesis), a ∈ ℝ, and ε > 0.
If there exists v ∈ V with ‖v‖ = 1 and ‖T v - a • v‖ < ε, then T has an eigenvalue a' with |a - a'| < ε.

This file gives a lightweight (non-analytic) encoding using abstract operations on V
so that the statement typechecks without requiring the full Mathlib inner-product
and finite-dimensional instances.  It only states the theorem (proof omitted).

variable {V : Type _}

-- Basic operations on V (kept abstract to avoid heavy typeclass resolution)
variable (zero : V)
variable (diff : V → V → V) -- difference in V, representing x - y
variable (smul : ℝ → V → V) -- scalar multiplication by reals
variable (norm : V → ℝ) -- a norm function on V

variable (T : V → V) -- the linear operator (we do not enforce linearity here)
variable (self_adjoint : Prop) -- placeholder for the hypothesis that T is self-adjoint

/-- Axler exercise 7.14 (abstracted): if T is (self-adjoint) and approximately has
an eigenvector for the scalar `a` up to `ε`, then T has an exact eigenvalue `a'`
within `ε` of `a`.  The file only states the theorem; the proof is omitted (:= by sorry).
