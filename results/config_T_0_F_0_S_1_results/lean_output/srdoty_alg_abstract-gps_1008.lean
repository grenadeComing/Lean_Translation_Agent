Statement: Let O(2) be the group of real 2×2 orthogonal matrices and SO(2)
its subgroup of rotations. For any fixed improper orthogonal matrix
A ∈ O(2) \ SO(2) (i.e. det A = -1), every orthogonal matrix M is either
in SO(2) or can be written as M = R ⬝ A with R ∈ SO(2). In particular,
O(2) is generated by SO(2) ∪ {A}.

This file gives a formal Lean4 statement of that fact (no proof).
