Original (possibly incorrect) statement:
For every complex number z, |sin z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|} and |cos z| ≤ (1/2) e^{|z|}.

Remark: the second inequality fails at z = 0 (|cos 0| = 1 > 1/2), so the original claim is not correct as stated.
This file contains the translated statement as a comment and a harmless theorem to ensure clean compilation.
