If f : U → ℂ is a holomorphic function on a domain U ⊂ ℂ, then f is analytic.

Statement (no proof):
Let U ⊂ ℂ be a domain (open and connected) and suppose that a holomorphic function f : U → ℂ is not constant.
If f(z0) = c and f'(z0) = 0, then either f(z) = c for all z ∈ U, or else if z0 is a zero of f - c of order m,
then there exists a neighborhood V of z0 such that f ⁻¹({c}) ∩ V consists of exactly m points (counted with multiplicities).

The theorem below states a standard local factorization of f - c near z0 (the usual formulation from complex analysis).
This formal statement purposely expresses the existence of m ≥ 1 and a holomorphic g with g(z0) ≠ 0 such that
f(z) - c = (z - z0)^m * g(z) on some neighborhood V ⊆ U. From this one deduces the assertion about the number of
solutions of f(z) = c in that neighborhood (counted with multiplicity).
