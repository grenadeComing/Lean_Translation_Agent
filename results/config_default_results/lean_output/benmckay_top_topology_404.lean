-- Ben McKay's translation of the following statement:
-- Suppose f : X → Y is a continuous bijection from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y.
-- Prove that the inverse f ⁻¹ : Y → X is continuous.
-- Note: The provided statement is not true in general (a counterexample exists without extra hypotheses such as compactness).

Let f : X → Y be a function which is continuous and bijective. Consider the inverse function obtained from the bijection. This theorem is a placeholder and only encodes the statement; the proof is not provided here.
