variable (X : Type) [MetricSpace X]

/-- The space of bounded continuous functions X → ℝ -/ 
def cb_space : Type := BoundedContinuousFunction X ℝ

/-- 1) The space (C_b(X, ℝ), d) is a metric space -/ 
theorem cb_metric_space_instance : MetricSpace cb_space := by
  infer_instance

/-- 2) Convergence in d is equivalent to uniform convergence -/
theorem cb_tendsto_uniform_iff
  {f_n : ℕ → cb_space} {f : cb_space} :
  Tendsto f_n atTop (𝓝 f) ↔
  (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ x : X, |(f_n n) x - f x| ≤ ε) := by
  -- This is a standard characterization of convergence in the sup metric
