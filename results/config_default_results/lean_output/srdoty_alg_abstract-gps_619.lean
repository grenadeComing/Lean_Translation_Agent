/-- A skeleton encoding: G' is the set of nonzero 2x2 real matrices of the form [[a, -b], [b, a]]
 but here we encode G' as the subtype of nonzero 2x2 matrices; the specific form will be elaborated in a full proof. -/
structure G'Struct where
  m : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ
  hneq : m ≠ 0

/-- Root level: declare G' as a set of nonzero 2x2 matrices (this is a placeholder encoding). -/
