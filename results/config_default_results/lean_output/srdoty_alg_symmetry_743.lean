/-- Let D_n be the dihedral group of a regular n-gon (n ≥ 3). Let r be the rotation by 2π/n and h be the reflection across the horizontal axis. Prove that rhr=h by giving an algebraic argument with matrices (represent r by a rotation matrix and h by a suitable reflection matrix). Save it to: srdoty_alg_symmetry_743.lean -/
