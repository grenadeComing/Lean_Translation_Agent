Let F be a field. A permutation matrix in GL_n(F) is an n×n matrix obtained from the identity matrix by a permutation of its columns (equivalently, it has exactly one entry 1 in each row and each column, and all other entries are 0).
Prove that the symmetric group S_n is isomorphic to the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL_n(F) via the map α ↦ P_α, where P_α is the permutation matrix obtained by applying α∈S_n to the columns of the identity matrix.
